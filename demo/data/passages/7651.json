It comprises the small local deviations of a surface from the perfectly flat ideal (a true plane). Finally, the data is summarized using one or more roughness parameters, or a graph. In the past, surface finish was usually analyzed by hand. The roughness trace would be plotted on graph paper, and an experienced machinist decided what data to ignore and where to place the mean line. Today, the measured data is stored on a computer, and analyzed using methods from signal analysis and statistics"}, {"url": "http://www.slideshare.net/mokhtarpadeli/unit4-surface-texture", "passage_text": "1 The inch unit for surface finish measurement is microinch (\u00b5in), while the metric unit is micrometer (\u00b5m). 2  3.

Surface roughness ot texture is the measure if the finer surface irregularities in the surface texture and is composed of three components: roughness, waviness and form. These are the result of the manufacturing process employed to create the surface.

Housings: H7 Shafts: h7. Surface finish Housings The surface finish on the housing is not critical as there is no movement after installation. For the purpose of installing the bearing the cut must not be too coarse. Lead in chamfers are required to ensure that the bearing does not score when been installed. Shafts The surface finish of the shaft is very important to ensure a correct operation of the bearing. A good finish of the order of 2.5 \u00b5m Ra (20 micro inch Ra) should be provided on shaft surfaces for an optimum wear life. For shafts with an axial motion relative to the bearing, a finish of the order of 0.5 \u00b5m Ra (20 micro inch Ra) should be provided on shaft.
