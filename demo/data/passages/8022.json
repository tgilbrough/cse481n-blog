In mathematics, the limit of a function is a fundamental concept in calculus and analysis concerning the behavior of that function near a particular input. Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. The function f is continuous at p if and only if the limit of f (x) as x approaches p exists and is equal to f (p). If f: M \u2192 N is a function between metric spaces M and N, then it is equivalent that f transforms every sequence in M which converges towards p into a sequence in N which converges towards f (p)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function", "passage_text": "We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p.
