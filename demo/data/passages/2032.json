This can be a helpful tool for weight loss as it allows you to estimate the amount of calories that represents your energy balance.

Resting energy expenditure remains elevated as long as you exercise at least three days a week on a regular basis. Because resting energy expenditure accounts for 60% to 75% of the calories you burn each day, any increase in resting energy expenditure is extremely important to your weight-loss effort. The kinds of vigorous activity that can stimulate your metabolism include walking briskly for two miles or riding a bike uphill.
