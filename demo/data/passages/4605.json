Hormones are chemical substances that affect the activity of another part of the body (target site). In essence, hormones serve as messengers, controlling and coordinating activities throughout the body. In contrast, thyroid hormone, produced in the thyroid gland, affects cells throughout the body and is involved in such important functions as regulating growth of cells, controlling the heart rate, and affecting the speed at which calories are burned."}, {"url": "http://www.innovateus.net/health/what-function-ovaries", "passage_text": "The ovaries are the primary source of the female hormones. The female hormones are: 1  Estrogen: Estrogen is secreted by a number of cells in the follicle. 2  On the way to ovulation, the follicle that has the maturing egg goes through the surface of the ovary."}, {"url": "http://www.innovateus.net/health/what-function-ovaries", "passage_text": "The ovary is an ovum-producing reproductive organ, often found in pairs as part of the vertebrate female reproductive system. Ovaries are oval-shaped endocrine system glands, the group of glands that produce a variety of hormones human body needs to function appropriately. Ovaries are found in females, one on each side of the uterus. An ovum is a female reproductive cell. The female hormones are: 1  Estrogen: Estrogen is secreted by a number of cells in the follicle. 2  On the way to ovulation, the follicle that has the maturing egg goes through the surface of the ovary."}, {"url": "https://quizlet.com/1377520/hormone-function-main-hormones-flash-cards/", "passage_text": "Hormone produced by the pancreas that is released when stimulated by elevated glucose levels. This hormone decreases blood sugar levels by accelerating the transport of glucose into the body cells where it is oxidized for energy or converted to glycogen or fat for storage. Produced by the thyroid gland and decreases the blood calcium levels by stimulating calcium deposit in the bones (calcitonin keeps the bone in).

The 2 main thyroid hormones are T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine). The amount of thyroid hormones secreted is controlled by another hormone, called thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is released from the pituitary gland in your head. Another hormone that\u2019s produced in your thyroid gland is called calcitonin. This hormone, secreted by a small population of cells known as C cells, is involved in regulating the level of calcium in your blood.

The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs.
