This includes animals, plants, protists, archaea and bacteria. DNA is in each cell in the organism and tells cells what proteins to make. Mostly, these proteins are enzymes. DNA is inherited by children from their parents. This is why children share traits with their parents, such as skin, hair and eye color.

Step 1 - Helicase unwinds the DNA so that the two strands are separated. Step 2 - Primase adds an RNA primer to each unwound DNA strand.
