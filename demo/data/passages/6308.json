Of these, 60% are calcaneus fractures. The heel bone is often injured in a high-energy collision where other parts of the skeleton are also injured. In up to 10% of cases, the patient can also sustain a fracture of the spine, hip, or the other calcaneus. Injuries to the calcaneus often damage the subtalar joint and cause the joint to become stiff."}, {"url": "http://www.healthcommunities.com/foot-anatomy/foot-anatomy-overview.shtml", "passage_text": "The hindfoot is composed of three joints and links the midfoot to the ankle (talus).
