The amount will be debited against your account about 2 minutes after the payment envelope is opened at the IRS Service Center in most cases. If the funds to cover it won't be available until Friday, don't mail it until Friday. If you need 4 days, hold off for the full 4 days before mailing the payment. A late payment penalty will be less onerous than a bounced check penalty. If you bounce a payment the IRS will assess fees (on top of the late payment penalties and interest) as will your bank. A single bounced check can add up to $50 to $60 in additional charges. It's against the law to issue a check if you don't have funds in your account to cover it immediately"}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070424130207AA6FUX9", "passage_text": "If it takes 2 days for your return to get to the Service Center, figure it will clear on the 2nd or 3rd day after you put the return in the mail.
