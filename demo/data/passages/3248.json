In instances where extreme bleeding occurs, red blood cells, platelets, and macrophages are released from the spleen. Macrophages help to reduce inflammation and destroy pathogens or damaged cells in the injured area."}, {"url": "http://www.laparoscopic.md/digestion/spleen", "passage_text": "Red pulp is red because it has many small cavities (sinusoids) where the spleen stores blood in case of injury or other situations where the body needs extra blood. This blood reserve has a high count of platelets, an essential component for blood coagulation to help stop bleeding."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/picture-of-the-spleen", "passage_text": "The spleen plays multiple supporting roles in the body. It acts as a filter for blood as part of the immune system. Old red blood cells are recycled in the spleen, and platelets and white blood cells are stored there. The spleen also helps fight certain kinds of bacteria that cause pneumonia and meningitis."}, {"url": "http://www.kidsgrowth.com/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=1265", "passage_text": "What is the Spleen and what does it do? The spleen is the soft, purplish-red organ tucked just under the rib cage on the left side of the abdomen. It is about the size of the heart and is made up of a spongy material that can hold up to three gallons of blood."}, {"url": "http://patient.info/health/the-spleen", "passage_text": "This leaflet gives a brief overview of the spleen and its functions.
