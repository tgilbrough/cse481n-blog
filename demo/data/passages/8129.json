We know that as many as 75% of adults infected with hepatitis C are baby boomers. We know the disease is potentially deadly, killing some 17,000 Americans a year.

Disease burden models have predicted worsening morbidity of liver disease caused by hepatitis C in the United States. The aim of this study was to determine the trend in hospitalizations caused by hepatitis C and advanced liver disease.
