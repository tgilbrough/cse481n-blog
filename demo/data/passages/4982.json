Even though they are not necessarily a symptom of pregnancy, or even a common complaint, it does appear that women are more susceptible to getting them while they are pregnant. This can cause the hiccups to form. You can also get hiccups from acid reflux, which tends to be stronger during pregnancy.

But I would think that's stretching it. Hiccups in and of themselves are probably not an early pregnancy sign.
