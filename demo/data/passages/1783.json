Plants that come into contact with nitrate-rich soil or water contain varying levels of nitrates. When farmer's add fertilizers with nitrates to crops, some of the nitrates move from the soil into the plants. Vegetables can contain nitrates, and over 70 percent of the nitrates the average adult consumes comes from nitrates in natural foods, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

Sodium nitrate is present in foods such as hot dogs, lunch meat, bacon, ham, smoked fish, salami and beef jerky. You can read the ingredient list on the food labels to see if a food contains sodium nitrate as a preservative. Sodium nitrate is a type of salt used to preserve foods, particularly cured meat. It's added to cured meat to extend its shelf life by preventing rancidity and the growth of bacteria.

There is no recommendation to limit foods that naturally contain nitrates. Nitrates are also added to processed meats as a preservative. There is strong research that shows a diet high in processed meats increases the risk of colon cancer. 1 This means that the food may contain nitrates. 2  Avoid processed meat or have them once in awhile. 3  Have a cooked ham during the holidays or an occasional hot dog in the summer. 4  Skip the bacon and sausage for breakfast and try fresh fruit or grilled vegetables with your eggs."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/how-does_4914598_do-nitrates-food-do-body.html", "passage_text": "Sources of Nitrates. Nitrates are not only found naturally in the soil, water and atmosphere, but are also in fruits and vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, collard greens and root vegetables. Preservatives, particularly those in processed meats such as hot dogs and deli meats, contain nitrates. Nitrates are found naturally in the environment -- mineral deposits, soil, fertilizers, seawater and even the atmosphere -- from which they enter the food you eat and the water you drink.
