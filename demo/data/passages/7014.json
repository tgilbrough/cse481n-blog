The top level contains the largest number of organisms, and as you go lower and lower, you narrow the choices to one individual organism. The levels are 1) Kingdom, 2) Phylum, 3) Class, 4) Order, 5) Family, 6) Genus, and 7) Species. Example: Kingdom \u2013 Animalia: all animals. Phylum: this level contains the organisms that are more like each other than another phylum. Then these organisms are sorted into classes. Example: Phylum \u2013 Chordata: one phylum could be all animals with a hollow nerve cord. Class: these are the organisms that have even more likeness to each other"}, {"url": "http://www.fcps.edu/islandcreekes/ecology/classification.htm", "passage_text": "Genus. Species. As each group is split into smaller groups, the organisms are more and more alike. For instance, a White-tailed Deer, an Eastern Gray Squirrel, and an Eastern Chipmunk are all in the Mammal Class together. Classification of living things is called Taxonomy.. This is when scientists put organisms into groups when they have things in common. The first groups they use are the Kingdoms. There are five kingdoms:"}, {"url": "http://utahscience.oremjr.alpine.k12.ut.us/sciber99/7th/classify/sciber/7levels.htm", "passage_text": "Every organism can be classified at 7 different levels-kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species. Each level contains organisms with similar characteristics. The kingdom is the largest group and very broad. Each successive group contains fewer organisms, but the organisms are more similar. The species is the smallest group and is very narrow. Organisms within a species are able to mate and produce fertile offspring. The following chart traces the classification of a grizzly bear through each of the 7 levels of classification.
