[{"url": "http://www.cheftalk.com/t/55701/leftover-canned-refried-beans-how-long-in-fridge", "passage_text": "Here's my standard procedure: I open a can of beans and use half immediately. The other half I store in a sealed plastic container in the fridge and use within 24 hours. My question is can I keep the stored half longer than 24 hours, and if so how long? I don't know what 2-3 days means. If I open the can on Monday, is Tuesday considered 1 day old or 2 days old? If someone could give me the expiration time in hours as opposed to days, it would make a lot more sense to me.

Instead, keep dried beans, peas and lentils in airtight containers and store them in a dry, cool, dark place. If you do it right, beans will last up to a year, lentils, up to 6 months. Cooked: Refrigerate cooked beans in a covered container for up to 5 days. (If it's really warm in your kitchen, soak the beans in the refrigerator instead to avoid fermentation.). Quick soak: Put beans into a large pot and cover with 2 to 3 inches of cool, clean water. Bring to a boil then boil briskly for 2 to 3 minutes. Cover and set aside off of the heat for 1 hour; drain well."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_long_do_refried_beans_last_in_refrigerator", "passage_text": "How long do beans last in the refrigerator?
