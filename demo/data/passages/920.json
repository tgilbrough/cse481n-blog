[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh", "passage_text": "Marsh in shallow water on a lakeshore. A marsh is a wetland that is dominated by herbaceous rather than woody plant species. Marshes can often be found at the edges of lakes and streams, where they form a transition between the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. They are often dominated by grasses, rushes or reeds. The plants must be able to survive in wet mud with low oxygen levels. Many of these plants therefore have aerenchyma, channels within the stem that allow air to move from the leaves into the rooting zone. Marsh plants also tend to have rhizomes for underground storage and reproduction."}, {"url": "http://www.napsva.org/coastal_marshes.htm", "passage_text": "Salt marshes contain abundant organic matter, which is the source of energy. The mud in the marsh is anoxic because other bacteria quickly consume dissolved oxygen to respire (burn) the abundant organic matter. Groundwater discharge and surface runoff into the marsh provides nitrate. They can smell bad because of the release of hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg gas). They often breed undesirable organisms like mosquitoes. They consume prime waterfront real estate. They release greenhouse gasses like methane and nitrous oxide."}, {"url": "http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/estuaries/media/supp_estuar06a_saltmarsh.html", "passage_text": "Marshes are divided into distinct zones, the high marsh and the low marsh. The difference in elevation between these two areas is usually only a few centimeters, but for the plants that inhabit each of these zones, a few centimeters makes a world of difference. The low marsh floods daily at high tide. Salt marshes are a mosaic of snaking channels called tidal creeks that fill with seawater during high tides and drain during low tides. Fish species including flounder and mullet live most of their lives in marsh creeks.

Since the water doesn't move around much, the decay plus wet muddy soil smells stagnant, earthy, 'froggy'. There may be the musty smell of various molds that love wetlands.
