The skin and hair also give away important information in determining gestational age, as well as a host of other characteristics described in this site."}, {"url": "http://www.atitesting.com/ati_next_gen/skillsmodules/content/maternal-newborn/equipment/gestational_age.html", "passage_text": "To determine the approximate gestational age of a newborn, you\u2019ll assess six neuromuscular and six physical characteristics. This assessment, the New Ballard Score, is appropriate for newborns from 20 to 44 weeks of gestation, with the characteristics to assess varying with the stage of maturity. Each parameter scores from minus 2 to 5, with the cumulative score correlating with a gestational age between 26 and 44 weeks. Timing of the gestational assessment influences the accuracy of its results. For newborns younger than 26 gestational weeks, perform the assessment sooner than 12 hours after birth. For newborns beyond 26 gestational weeks, perform the examination within 96 hours of birth."}, {"url": "http://www.medcomrn.com/?a=product/detailbase&basecode=78811ER", "passage_text": "Overview: This program focuses on the New Ballard Gestational Age Assessment.
