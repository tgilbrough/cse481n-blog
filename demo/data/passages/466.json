Tyrosine is one of the amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. The body makes tyrosine from another amino acid called phenylalanine. Tyrosine can also be found in dairy products, meats, fish, eggs, nuts, beans, oats, and wheat. Tyrosine is used in protein supplements to treat an inherited disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). 1 People with PKU are not able to process the amino acid phenylalanine, which is used by the body to make tyrosine. 2  Because of this, people with PKU can have low levels of tyrosine in the body. 3  People with PKU are advised to consume 6 grams of tyrosine per 100 grams of protein to improve tyrosine levels"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine", "passage_text": "Tyrosine (abbreviated as Tyr or Y) or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine, is one of the 22 amino acids that are used by cells to synthesize proteins.
