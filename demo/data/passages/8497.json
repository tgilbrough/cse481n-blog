For example, a person with blood type A-cannot get blood that is positive. However, a person who is positive for the Rh antigen can get blood from positive or negative blood donors. Rh is not passed down from parents. With your parents having AB and O, you can only have type A or type B blood because O is recessive. You could have type O if your mother was AO or BO, but she isn't.

A parent with O type and a parent with A type blood can have O or A children. A person's blood type is determined largely by genetics, and it does not change through his or her lifetime.

Sometimes it's possible to determine whether you have a positive or negative blood type simply by finding out your parents blood type. However, this only works if both of your biological parents have the same Rhesus factor. Ask your doctor for a blood typing test.

There are three alleles or versions of the blood type gene: A, B, and O. Since everybody has two copies of these genes, there are six possible combinations; AA, BB, OO, AB, AO, and BO. Rh is not passed down from parents. With your parents having AB and O, you can only have type A or type B blood because O is recessive.
