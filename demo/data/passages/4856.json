The high cost of feed grains and many high-protein grains may make the use of urea as a protein source very cost-effective in many cattle diets. Several issues must be considered, though, to make its use most effective. Urea is a non-protein nitrogen compound. That is, the nitrogen portion of urea is used as the building block for the production of protein by rumen microbes. Most urea contains about 45% nitrogen, and protein contains 16% nitrogen. Therefore, when urea is converted to protein, the crude protein equivalent value of urea is about 281%. It must be recalled that urea contains no other useful feed components such as energy, minerals, or vitamin"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea", "passage_text": "Urea in concentrations up to 10 M is a powerful protein denaturant as it disrupts the noncovalent bonds in the proteins. This property can be exploited to increase the solubility of some proteins. A mixture of urea and choline chloride is used as a deep eutectic solvent, a type of ionic liquid.
