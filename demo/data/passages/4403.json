Domain: The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (often the x variable), which produce a valid output from a particular function. Well, if the domain is the set of all real numbers for which the function is defined, then logically we're looking for a function that has certain input values that do not produce a valid output, i.e., the function is undefined for that input.

Given a function f: X \u2192 Y, the set X is the domain of f; the set Y is the codomain of f. In the expression f (x), x is the argument and f (x) is the value.
