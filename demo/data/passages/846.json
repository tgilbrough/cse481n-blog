Infections of the respiratory tract are grouped according to their symptomatology and anatomic involvement. Acute upper respiratory infections (URI) include the common cold, pharyngitis, epiglottitis, and laryngotracheitis (Fig. 93-1). Bronchitis and bronchiolitis involve inflammation of the bronchial tree. Bronchitis is usually preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection or forms part of a clinical syndrome in diseases such as influenza, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, scarlet fever and typhoid fever."}, {"url": "http://classes.midlandstech.edu/carterp/Courses/bio225/chap24/lecture2.htm", "passage_text": "Specific areas of the upper respiratory system can become infected to produce pharyngitis, laryngitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis, and epiglottis. These infections may be caused by several bacteria and viruses, often in combination. Most respiratory tract infections are self-limiting.

Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) can be caused by viruses, bacteria and (less often) fungi. Most common respiratory tract infections such as colds, sore throats, sinusitis and laryngitis are caused by viruses. One type of virus can cause more than one type of RTI. For example, the viruses that cause a cold can also cause: 1  sinus infections (sinusitis). Bacteria can also cause RTIs, including serious infections such as pneumonia and whooping cough (pertussis) . Sometimes bacteria can cause a second infection after you have had an RTI caused by a virus.
