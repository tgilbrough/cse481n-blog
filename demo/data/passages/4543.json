It is well known that Diamond is the hardest substance found in nature, but few people realize that Diamond is four times harder than the next hardest natural mineral, corundum (sapphire and ruby). But even as hard as it is, it is not impervious. 1 Diamond is transparent, Graphite is opaque. 2  Diamond crystallizes in the Isometric system and graphite crystallizes in the hexagonal system. 3  Somewhat of a surprise is that at surface temperatures and pressures, Graphite is the stable form of carbon."}, {"url": "http://geology.com/diamond/", "passage_text": "Diamond Producers Diamond Production leaders include: Botswana, Russia, Angola and Canada.

It is formed deep in the mantle, and is only brought to the surface via kimberlite pipes, lamprophyres, eclogites and other rocks that originate deep within the mantle.

Each carbon atom in a diamond is surrounded by four other carbon atoms and connected to them by strong covalent bonds. This simple, uniform, tightly-bonded arrangement yields one of the most durable substances known. Gem diamonds are stones with color and clarity that make them suitable for jewelry or investment use. These stones are especially rare and make up a minor portion of worldwide diamond production.
