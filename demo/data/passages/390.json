Distillation is the process in which water is boiled, evaporated and the vapor condensed.

In reality, bottled water is just water. That fact isn't stopping people from buying a lot of it. Estimates variously place worldwide bottled water sales at between $50 and $100 billion each year, with the market expanding at the startling annual rate of 7 percent. Bottled water is big business. But in terms of sustainability, bottled water is a dry well. It's costly, wasteful and distracts from the brass ring of public health: the construction and maintenance of safe municipal water systems.

These minerals (present in ionized water) such as calcium, magnesium and fluoride contribute to our nutritious intake and create a deficiency when not present. Although we can drink purified water, it is actively discouraged so that our bodies maintain a healthy balance. With a total lack of mineral ions in this water, unless we are absorbing the necessary minerals through our food, we are risk of a serious mineral deficiency and an additional source would be required."}]
