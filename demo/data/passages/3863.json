Confidence votes 5.0K. Meiosis is a division process that produces four daughter cells each containing haploid number of chromosomes. In humans, as well as a variety of other mammals, meiosis is responsible for the production of gametes (also called germ line cells or sex cells)."}, {"url": "http://www2.estrellamountain.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/BioBookmeiosis.html", "passage_text": "Meiosis produces 4 haploid cells. Mitosis produces 2 diploid cells. The old name for meiosis was reduction/ division. Meiosis I reduces the ploidy level from 2n to n (reduction) while Meiosis II divides the remaining set of chromosomes in a mitosis-like process (division). Most of the differences between the processes occur during Meiosis I. Meiosis is a special type of nuclear division which segregates one copy of each homologous chromosome into each new gamete. Mitosis maintains the cell's original ploidy level (for example, one diploid 2n cell producing two diploid 2n cells; one haploid n cell producing two haploid n cells; etc.)."}, {"url": "http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/meiosis-88", "passage_text": "Meiosis has both similarities to and differences from mitosis, which is a cell division process in which a parent cell produces two identical daughter cells. Meiosis begins following one round of DNA replication in cells in the male or female sex organs. The process is split into meiosis I and meiosis II, and both meiotic divisions have multiple phases. Meiosis I is a type of cell division unique to germ cells, while meiosis II is similar to mitosis."}, {"url": "http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/meiosis-88", "passage_text": "Meiosis is a type of cell division that reduces the number of chromosomes in the parent cell by half and produces four gamete cells. This process is required to produce egg and sperm cells for sexual reproduction. During reproduction, when the sperm and egg unite to form a single cell, the number of chromosomes is restored in the offspring. Meiosis begins with a parent cell that is diploid, meaning it has two copies of each chromosome. Meiosis begins following one round of DNA replication in cells in the male or female sex organs. The process is split into meiosis I and meiosis II, and both meiotic divisions have multiple phases.
