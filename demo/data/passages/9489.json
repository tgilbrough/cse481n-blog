[{"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_causes_of_a_tropical_cyclone", "passage_text": "A tropical cyclone is a cyclone, but not all cyclones are tropical. All cyclones have low pressure, and an organized circulation about a center, with winds flowing in a cyclon \u2026 ic manner, that is counterclockwise if it is in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. A hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone ,which is a generic term for a low pressure system that generally forms in the tropics. A hurricane is an intense, rotating oceani \u2026 c weather system."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "passage_text": "A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain. A hurricane or typhoon (sometimes simply referred to as a tropical cyclone, as opposed to a depression or storm) is a system with sustained winds of at least 34 metres per second (66 kn) or 74 miles per hour (119 km/h)."}, {"url": "http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/hazards/cyclone/basics/what", "passage_text": "A tropical cyclone is a low-pressure system which develops in the tropics and is sufficiently intense to produce sustained gale force winds of at least 63km/h. In other parts of the world they are called hurricanes or typhoons. Tropical cyclones can cause significant phenomena which can adversely, and sometimes favourably impact on communities and the environment. The most common features are destructive winds and heavy rainfall that can lead to flooding."}, {"url": "http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/about/", "passage_text": "Tropical Cyclones are low pressure systems that form over warm tropical waters and have gale force winds (sustained winds of 63 km/h or greater and gusts in excess of 90 km/h) near the centre. Tropical cyclones derive their energy from the warm tropical oceans and do not form unless the sea-surface temperature is above 26.5\u00b0C, although once formed, they can persist over lower sea-surface temperatures. Tropical cyclones can persist for many days and may follow quite erratic paths."}, {"url": "http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/hazards/cyclone/basics/what", "passage_text": "Cyclone seen from Space. A tropical cyclone is a low-pressure system which develops in the tropics and is sufficiently intense to produce sustained gale force winds of at least 63km/h. If the sustained wind reaches hurricane force of at least 118km/h the system is defined as a severe tropical cyclone. In other parts of the world they are called hurricanes or typhoons. Tropical cyclones can cause significant phenomena which can adversely, and sometimes favourably impact on communities and the environment. The most common features are destructive winds and heavy rainfall that can lead to flooding."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_tropical_cyclones", "passage_text": "A mature tropical cyclone can release heat at a rate upwards of 6x10 14 watts. Tropical cyclones on the open sea cause large waves, heavy rain, and high winds, disrupting international shipping and, at times, causing shipwrecks. Generally, after its passage, a tropical cyclone stirs up ocean water, lowering sea surface temperatures behind it. The storm surge, or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone, is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones, historically resulting in 90% of tropical cyclone deaths. The relatively quick surge in sea level can move miles/kilometers inland, flooding homes and cutting off escape routes."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "passage_text": "Depending on its location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by names such as hurricane (/\u02c8h\u028cr\u0268k\u0259n/ or /\u02c8h\u028cr\u0268ke\u026an/), typhoon /ta\u026a\u02c8fu\u02d0n/ , tropical storm, cyclonic storm, tropical depression, and simply cyclone. Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water. A hurricane or typhoon (sometimes simply referred to as a tropical cyclone, as opposed to a depression or storm) is a system with sustained winds of at least 34 metres per second (66 kn) or 74 miles per hour (119 km/h)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "passage_text": "For this reason, coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to damage from a tropical cyclone as compared to inland regions. Heavy rains, however, can cause significant flooding inland, and storm surges can produce extensive coastal flooding up to 40 kilometres (25 mi) from the coastline.
