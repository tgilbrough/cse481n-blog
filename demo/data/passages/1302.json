Now let's compare these costs per page to a laserjet printer. An HP laser printer that retails for $400 and uses a $115 laser toner will yield around 8,000 pages. If you print 40,000 pages the cost will be approximately $400, plus $460 for the ink toner. That\u2019s a total cost of $860. A similar Brother laserjet printer costs around $930 for the same number of pages. The total cost is less than $.02 a page, which is eight times less than the cost of an inkjet."}, {"url": "http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2367866,00.asp", "passage_text": "Lexmark T650n.
