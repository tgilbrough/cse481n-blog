It is important to remember that most kinds of E. coli bacteria do not cause disease in humans, indeed, some are beneficial, and some cause infections other than gastrointestinal infections, such urinary tract infections. Escherichia coli (E. coli) are members of a large group of bacterial germs that inhabit the intestinal tract of humans and other warm-blooded animals (mammals, birds). Newborns have a sterile alimentary tract, which within two days becomes colonized with E. coli.

They must have split from the other two after the bulk of the development of biochemistry and cell biology had taken place. Up to the time of the Last Universal Ancestor (LUA) the world had been monophyletic with little stable diversity. One arose from the consequences of cells accumulating substances from the environment, thus increasing their internal osmotic pressure. This resulted in two nearly simultaneous biological solutions: one (Bacteria) was the development of the external sacculus, i.e. the formation of a stress-bearing exoskeleton."}, {"url": "http://www.hrwc.org/the-watershed/threats/bacteria/sources/", "passage_text": "Bacteria can come from many different sources, including: Most pets that poop on the lawn are warm blooded mammals, which means that their excrement contains E. coli bacteria.
