Vacuoles store water and certain materials that are water-soluble. They are present in all plant and fungi cells. They are also found in some species of bacteria and in some animal cells. In plants and fungi, vacuoles store water and some pigments, and they also provide turgor pressure to support the cells from within."}, {"url": "http://www.brighthub.com/science/genetics/articles/27422.aspx", "passage_text": "Animal cell vacuoles are much smaller than their plant cell counterparts and in animal cells their roles are more subservient. They assist in expelling proteins and lipids from the cell. The process is known as exocytosis and the role of the vacuole here is to store the molecules and facilitate their transport. Most of a cell's volume depends on what's inside a vacuole. If there isn't much water about the vacuoles shrink and the plant droops and whithers. When there is abundance of water the vacuoles are topped up once again and the plant regains its normal structure."}, {"url": "http://kids.britannica.com/comptons/article-234337/cell", "passage_text": "Plant cells have a large central vacuole that stores water and other materials. Vacuoles are storage organelles that usually carry food molecules or wastes in solution. Plant cells have a large central vacuole that stores water and other materials. The central vacuole helps the cell maintain its volume and structure. The central vacuole in some cells plays a role in building stalks and stems. If a cambium cell is to become bark or wood, its membrane."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_does_a_vacuole_do_in_an_animal_cell", "passage_text": "Vacuoles in animal cells store food, water, waste, and minerals like plant cells.

Vacuoles can be large organelles occupying between 30% and 90% of a cell by volume. Vacuoles appear to have three main functions, they: Vacuoles and lysosomes have similar functions. Vacuoles in plant cells are in some respects the equivalent of lysosomes in animal cells. The environment inside a vacuole is slightly acid (pH about 5.0) whilst for the rest of the cytosol it is slightly alkaline (about pH 7.2)."}, {"url": "http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/plants/vacuole.html", "passage_text": "Many plant cells have a large, single central vacuole that typically takes up most of the room in the cell (80 percent or more).
