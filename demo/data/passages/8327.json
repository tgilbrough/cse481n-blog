It is part of the lean methodology of process improvement that helps organizations match unpredictable customer demand patterns and eliminate manufacturing waste by leveling the type and quantity of production output over a fixed period of time."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-heijunka.htm", "passage_text": "Heijunka is a Japanese word that refers to processes that help level or smooth out production. This system is a process that allows scheduling of the manufacturing process to concentrate on smaller, more manageable amounts in order to ensure that all the products from the line are the same."}, {"url": "http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/heijunka.html", "passage_text": "Show more usage examples... In an effort to become more efficient, the company implemented heijunka into their manufacturing process, with very small production batches moving through the line in a coordinated and even fashion."}, {"url": "http://www.shmula.com/about-peter-abilla/what-is-heijunka/", "passage_text": "Most businesses are cyclical \u2013 whether the business is B-to-B or C-to-C.

You can use kanban in the heijunka process to control and monitor the production of materials. Production smoothing is supported and even production over a certain period ensured through the ongoing production of small quantities on the basis of the kanbans. Kanban processing is a means of lot-size creation."}, {"url": "http://www.shmula.com/about-peter-abilla/what-is-heijunka/", "passage_text": "The Toyota Production System (Lean Manufacturing) uses Heijunka to solve fluctuations brought about by customer demand by assembling a mix of models within each batch, which ensures that there is an inventory of product proportional the variability in demand."}]
