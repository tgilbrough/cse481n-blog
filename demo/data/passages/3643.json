An individual skeletal muscle may be made up of hundreds, or even thousands, of muscle fibers bundled together and wrapped in a connective tissue covering. Each muscle is surrounded by a connective tissue sheath called the epimysium. Fascia, connective tissue outside the epimysium, surrounds and separates the muscles"}, {"url": "http://www.topendsports.com/testing/tests/muscle-fiber-composition.htm", "passage_text": "This is a simple indirect test that is used to estimate the predominant muscle fiber type-slow twitch or fast twitch. It is interesting for athletes to know the composition of their muscle fibers. If they are primarily a strength or speed athlete, they want fast twitch fibers. For endurance athletes, more slow twitch fibers is optimal. This test does not replace an actual muscle fiber composition test, which would be more accurate but involves an invasive muscle biopsy and more sophisticated analysis. 1  purpose: to estimate the predominant muscle fiber type for any given muscle group."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle", "passage_text": "Skeletal muscle is a form of striated muscle tissue which is under the voluntary control of the somatic nervous system. It is one of three major muscle types, the others being cardiac muscle and smooth muscle. Most skeletal muscles are attached to bones by bundles of collagen fibers known as tendons. Skeletal muscle is made up of individual muscle cells or myocytes, known as muscle fibers. Muscle fibres are cylindrical, and multinucleated. Muscle fibers are in turn composed of myofibrils. The myofibrils are composed of actin and myosin filaments, repeated in units called sarcomeres, the basic functional units of the muscle fiber. The sarcomere is responsible for the striated appearance of skeletal muscle, and forms the basic machinery necessary for muscle contraction"}, {"url": "http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/sclark20.htm", "passage_text": "Read on here to learn more about the 3 different muscle fibers and how they build differently depending on the type of sport.

Most mammalian muscles are composed of a mix of at least three different fiber types; indeed, muscles composed of nearly homogenous fiber type are the exception. The mechanical capabilities of each type of muscle stem from differences in the structures and metabolic properties of different types of muscle fibers.

Smooth muscle fibers are usually involuntary, and they are non-striated (smooth). Smooth muscle tissue, like skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue, can undergo hypertrophy (growth).
