It includes patterns of temperature, precipitation (rain or snow), humidity, wind and seasons. Climate patterns play a fundamental role in shaping natural ecosystems, and the human economies and cultures that depend on them."}, {"url": "http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate-guide/climate/what-affects-climate", "passage_text": "However, these factors do not work in isolation. Their effect is played through the world's complicated climate system. The climate system is really a set of interacting cycles: the atmosphere, hydrosphere (liquid and vaporised water), cryosphere (frozen water), land surface and biosphere (living organisms). These interact with each other and external forces including the Sun and human activity. Atmosphere."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_factors_affect_climate", "passage_text": "The four factors that affect climate are latitude, elevation,  distance to large bodies of water, and ocean currents.IN few cases  the greenery also effects the climate."}, {"url": "http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate-guide/climate/what-affects-climate", "passage_text": "The climate of the Earth depends on how much of the Sun's energy is retained in the land, sea and air-and how the climate system responds to changes. The major potential influences on the heat retained by the Earth include atmospheric composition, solar radiation and volcanic eruptions."}, {"url": "http://www.ecn.ac.uk/what-we-do/education/tutorials-weather-climate/climate/factors-affecting-climate/", "passage_text": "Factors affecting climate tutorial. There are many different factors that affect climate around the world. It is the varying influence of these factors that lead to different parts of the Earth experiencing differing climates. The most important natural factors are: 1  distance from the sea. 2  ocean currents."}]
