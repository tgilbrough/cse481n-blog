Strip foundation is the most common type of foundation used to build a new building or house extensions, because they offer good strength for their cost. In order to lay down strip foundations you need to excavate a trench at a minimum depth of 1.0m and have solid undisturbed ground. If it deviates from this, then this is considered as additional unforeseen costs which could not be priced up at the start of the project. This is a typical example of why you need a contingency amount of 10-15% set aside for such scenarios."}, {"url": "http://www.squirrelconstruction.co.uk/house_extension_cost.php", "passage_text": "If you have drains where you want your extension building then these need to be bridged. If you have a manhole cover where your extension is being built then these needs to be moved. Cost of this varies and again depending on whether or not it needs to be bridged or moved taking into account of access for digger. If it deviates from this, then this is considered as additional unforeseen costs which could not be priced up at the start of the project.
