In chemistry, the standard molar entropy is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under standard conditions (not standard temperature and pressure). The standard molar entropy is usually given the symbol S \u00b0, and as units of joules per mole kelvin (J mol \u22121 K \u22121). Unlike standard enthalpies of formation, the value of S \u00b0 is absolute. That is, an element in its standard state has a nonzero value of S \u00b0 at room temperature. The standard molar entropy of a gas at STP includes contributions from: 1  The heat capacity of one mole of the solid from 0 K to the melting point (including heat absorbed in any changes between different crystal structures). 2  The latent heat of fusion of the solid."}, {"url": "http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/applychem/entropy.html", "passage_text": "For example, the standard molar entropy of some solids are given below: The standard molar entropies (standard entropy per mole) for gases are usually higher because heat of melting and heat of vaporization must be included.
