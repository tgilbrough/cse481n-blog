Cost variances are most commonly tracked for expense line items, but can also be tracked at the job or project level, as long as there is a budget or standard against which it can be calculated. These variances form a standard part of many management reporting systems."}, {"url": "http://www.accountingtools.com/questions-and-answers/what-is-a-cost-variance.html", "passage_text": "There is an unfavorable cost variance when the actual cost incurred is greater than the budgeted amount. There is a favorable cost variance when the actual cost incurred is lower than the budgeted amount. Whether a variance ends up being positive or negative is partially due to the care with which the original budget was assembled.

Cost variance is simply the difference between what I budgeted and what I actually spent. So if I budgeted $5,000 for paint and the actual invoices for paint for the project added up to $4,500, I have a $500 positive cost variance.

A more refined approach is to split this difference into two elements: 1  Price variance. 2  That portion of the variance caused by a difference between the actual and expected price of the goods or services acquired. 3  Volume variance. 4  That portion of the variance caused by any change in the volume of goods or services ordered."}, {"url": "http://www.accountingtools.com/questions-and-answers/what-is-cost-variance-analysis.html", "passage_text": "For example, a company has an unfavorable variance in its cost of goods sold of $40,000.

Cost variance is the budgeted cost of work performed minus the actual cost of work performed. Tell me more \u2026. In the earned value reporting system for projects, we are concerned with knowing how our project is doing with respect to the amount of money being spent and the accomplishments being achieved. The cost variance is an important figure to the project manager and the other managers of the company because it is an indicator of how well the project is doing in terms of spending its budget."}, {"url": "http://smallbusiness.chron.com/cost-variance-24505.html", "passage_text": "Definition. Cost variance is a way of showing the financial performance of a project. Specifically, it is the mathematical difference between budgeted cost of work performed, or BCWP, and the actual cost of work performed, or ACWP. Therefore, companies pay close attention to their budgets and the cost of everything that happens within the business. One number of particular significance for general operational and project planning is the cost variance total."}]
