Bacterial cells are very small-about 10 times smaller than most plant and animal cells. Most bacterial cells range in size from 0.2 to 10 microns or micrometers (0.0000079 to 0.00039 inches). Common Escherichia coli, or E.coli, bacteria are rod-shaped bacteria, 1 micron by 2 microns long. Animal Cells. Most animal cells are between 10 to 100 microns in size. The size depends partially on the type of cell and its function. Red blood cells, which don't need to divide and replicate are only about 8 microns in diameter, while many muscle and nerve cells are thin, spindly and extremely long."}, {"url": "http://education.seattlepi.com/size-comparisons-bacteria-amoeba-animal-plant-cells-4966.html", "passage_text": "Smaller cells have a large surface area compared to cell volume, while larger cells have a reduced ratio of surface area to volume. One reason why bacterial cells are so small is that they need a large surface area to cell volume to take in nutrients. Bacteria accumulate nutrients from the environment by diffusion. Animal Cells. Most animal cells are between 10 to 100 microns in size. The size depends partially on the type of cell and its function.
