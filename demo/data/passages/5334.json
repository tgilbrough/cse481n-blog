A. DNA Replication in Bacteria. In general, DNA is replicated by uncoiling of the helix, strand separation by breaking of the hydrogen bonds between the complementary strands, and synthesis of two new strands by complementary base pairing (def). Replication begins at a specific site in the DNA called the origin of replication. DNA replication is bidirectional from the origin of replication (see Fig. 12). To begin DNA replication, unwinding enzymes called DNA helicases (def) cause the two parent DNA strands to unwind and separate from one another at the origin of replication to form two Y-shaped replication forks (def)."}]
