The first important use of the steam engine came in 1776. The steam engine was used to show the Cornish miners how successful it could be in removing the water from the mineshafts. This proved to be of great importance to the Cornish, because one of their biggest problems was the flooding of the mining shafts. Not only did the steam engine lead into the use of the means of traveling, for the purpose of importing, local deliveries, and transports of materials, but it made those three things quicker and cheaper. Transportation, which is a necessity for everyone today, was revolutionized because of the steam engine."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_power", "passage_text": "A steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid.

Using boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back about 2,000 years, but early devices were not practical. Since the late 1700s steam engines have become a major source of mechanical power. Boulton and Watt's early engines used half as much coal as John Smeaton's improved version of Newcomen's. Newcomen's and Watt's early engines were atmospheric. They were powered by air pressure pushing a piston into the partial vacuum generated by condensing steam, instead of the pressure of expanding steam."}, {"url": "http://www.livescience.com/44186-who-invented-the-steam-engine.html", "passage_text": "While the Spaniard first patented a steam-operated machine for use in mining, an Englishman is usually credited with inventing the first steam engine.

Almost half a century later, the first steam-powered automobiles were invented. Charles A. Parsons came up with first steam turbine in 1880. By the 20th century, the steam engine was widely used in automobiles and ships. At this time, the true power of steam was showcased as the energy was used to pump up the water from deep within the mines. With this, the potential power of steam was discovered, leading to the invention of a full fledged steam engine. Steam-powered electrical power plants in the modern world came later."}]
