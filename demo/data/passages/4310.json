The problem of \u2018orange peel\u2019 skin is caused by connective bands woven within the fat right underneath your skin. These bands pull the skin down which results in the typical cellulite dimpling look. Cellfina technology targets these connective bands and releases them. The dimpling appearance reduces after just one treatment and the smooth skin should last at least one year. As with any other minimally invasive procedure, Cellfina treatment involves minimum downtime. Performed in an outpatient setting, the patient is not limited at all after the treatment, except for taking it easy for the next 24 hours."}]
