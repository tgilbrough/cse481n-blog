A eukaryotic cell is a complex cell with a nucleus and many organelles. Eukaryotic cells are the building blocks of all animals, plants and fungi. Prokaryotic cells are very simple cells with fewer structures than eukaryotic cells; one primary difference is that they lack a nucleus. Ribosomes.

However, two organelles found in many eukaryotic cells, mitochondria and chloroplasts, contain ribosomes similar in size and makeup to those found in prokaryotes. This is one of many pieces of evidence that mitochondria and chloroplasts are themselves descended from free-living bacteria. Eukaryotes are organisms, including humans, whose cells have a well defined membrane-bound nucleus (containing chromosomal DNA) and organelles.

DNA is NOT a organelle it is just material used to program what the organisms behavior, looks etc. because prokaryotic cells don't have membranes bound organelles, thus no organelles are visible and DNA freely flows about in the organism."}, {"url": "http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/eukaryotic-cells-14023963", "passage_text": "In addition to the nucleus, eukaryotic cells may contain several other types of organelles, which may include mitochondria, chloroplasts, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes.
