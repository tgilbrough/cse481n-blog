This is 525,960 minutes. In a lifetime (of 67.2 years) we have 35,344,512 minutes (so you have about 35 million minutes of breathing space). An average person will breathe 0.5 (liters/breath) x 15 (breaths/minute) x 35,344,512 (minutes/lifetime), which equals 265,083,840 liters/lifetime. More or less 265 million liters of air. We have calculated that we breathe about 265 million liters of air in a life time"}, {"url": "https://www.sharecare.com/health/air-quality/oxygen-person-consume-a-day", "passage_text": "The average adult, when resting, inhales and exhales about 7 or 8 liters of air per minute. That totals about 11,000 liters of air per day. Inhaled air is about 20-percent oxygen. Exhaled air is about 15-percent oxygen. Therefore, about 5-percent of breathed air is consumed in each breath. That air is converted to carbon dioxide. So, as far as how much air is actually used, human beings take in about 550 liters of pure oxygen per day. A person who is exercising uses a lot more oxygen than that."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071023191551AAxbjEg", "passage_text": "Instead I used an average human lung tidal volume of 500 ml at a breath rate between 10 and 20 breaths per minute with 60 minutes per hour and 24 hours per day. Typical resting adult respiratory rates are 10\u201320 breaths per minute with 1/3 of the breath time in inspiration. According to Wikipedia: The average pair of human lungs can hold about 6 liters of air, but only a small amount of this capacity is used during normal breathing."}, {"url": "http://health.howstuffworks.com/human-body/systems/respiratory/question98.htm", "passage_text": "How much oxygen does a person consume in a day?

Confidence votes 45. The average exchange of air per breath is 500 ml for men and 390 mL for women and the average breathing rate is about 12 times per minute. That's about 6 litres a minute, 0.360 m3/hr for men and 4 litres a minute, 0.240 m3/hr for women"}, {"url": "http://www.emporia.edu/dotAsset/c4d35924-c81c-493e-8c72-d743e7ed0a0a.pdf", "passage_text": "1. Record the average breaths per minute for the Rbreather.n breaths/min x 0.5 liters of air = liters/min This value represents the amount of air consumed in one minute and is referred to as the respiratory minute volume. 2. PART I.--Calculations to determine how much air we breathe The average person inhales 500 ml, of air per breath. For simplicity, use 0.5 L. First, grab a partner and a calculator. Decide who will be the breather and who will be the recorder. The recorder will count the number of breaths each minute for five minutes."}, {"url": "http://members.shaw.ca/tfrisen/how_much_oxygen_for_a_person.htm", "passage_text": "(b) According to MadSci: The amount of air breathed by an average adult varies from 6 Litre/minute (when at rest) to 50 Litre/minute after hard exercise. So, at rest the amount of Oxygen absorbed by the blood in the lungs is 300 milliLitre/minute to 3,500 mL/minute. My Calculations for a person at rest: In 1 day the volume of O2 absorbed by a person at rest is 300mL/minute x 60 minute/hour x 24 h/day = 432,000 mL/day or 432 L/day."}]
