An operational definition is a detailed specification of how one would go about measuring a given variable. Operational definitions can range from very simple and straightforward to quite complex, depending on the nature of the variable and the needs of the researcher. Operational definitions should be tied to the theoretical constructs under study. The theory behind the research often clarifies the nature of the variables involved and, therefore, would guide the development of operational definitions that would tap the critical variables."}, {"url": "http://myweb.usf.edu/%7Eaheindel/PBSsection3b.html", "passage_text": "Operational Definitions: 1  thorough descriptions of a specific behavior: describe the behavior-what it looks like and the conditions under which it both occurs an d does not occur. 2  must answer the basic wh-questions, as well as to provide examples and non-examples of the behavior. 1 A thorough and specific description of an individual behavior. 2  Used to define both target (e.g., tantrums, elopement) or replacement behavior (e.g., gestures, engagement). 3  Used to promote clear communication across parents and professionals."}, {"url": "http://myweb.usf.edu/%7Eaheindel/PBSsection3b.html", "passage_text": "1 True False. 2  Operational definitions answer the \u201cWhy\u201d question about a child\u2019s challenging behavior. 3  True False. 4  One of the best ways to write an operational definition is to list specific examples and non-examples of the behavior. 5  True False. 6  Operational definitions are highly subjective objective, minimally objective. 1 A thorough and specific description of an individual behavior. 2  Used to define both target (e.g., tantrums, elopement) or replacement behavior (e.g., gestures, engagement). 3  Used to promote clear communication across parents and professionals."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_definition", "passage_text": "Operational definition. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. An operational definition is a result of the process of operationalization and is used to define something (e.g. a variable, term, or object) in terms of a process (or set of validation tests) needed to determine its existence, duration, and quantity. The most operational definition is a process for identification of an object by distinguishing it from its background of empirical experience. The binary version produces either the result that the object exists, or that it doesn't, in the experiential field to which it is applied."}, {"url": "http://whatislovedrcookerly.com/124/a-behavioral-operational-definition-of-love/", "passage_text": "A Behavioral (Operational) Definition of Love. richard.

It is also vital to define a target behavior for both a Functional Behavior Analysis (FBA) and a Behavior Intervention Program (BIP) . An operational definition describes the behavior in terms of what you see. It is an explicit definition that two or more disinterested observers would be able to identify. Academic goals should also be operationally defined: you define the academic behavior the child should exhibit.
