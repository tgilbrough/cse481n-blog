The frequency at which an object emits electromagnetic radiation is called its principle frequency. The principle frequency increases as the temperature increases. The Sun is hotter than the Earth and so has a higher principle frequency. Infra-red radiation is an electromagnetic wave and can travel through a vacuum. Heat from the Sun reaches us through the vacuum of space by travelling as infra-red radiation.

It is often easiest to measure this from the crest of one wave to the crest of the next wave, but it doesn't matter where as long as it is the same point in each wave. Frequency. The frequency of a wave is the number of waves produced by a source each second. It is also the number of waves that pass a certain point each second. The unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz). It is common for kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz) and gigahertz (GHz) to be used when waves have very high frequencies"}, {"url": "http://www.gcse.com/waves/frequency.htm", "passage_text": "Frequency. This is less well understood, but is easy if you look at the word. Frequency means how frequent. In other words, how often something happens. In physics, we normally expect frequency to be how many times something happens per second. For a wave, frequency means: how many waves per second."}, {"url": "http://hannahhelpphysics.blogspot.com/2013/03/33-define-amplitude-frequency.html", "passage_text": "The number of waves per second, it is measured in Hertz (Hz).
