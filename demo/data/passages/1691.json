For other uses of orbit or orbita see Orbit (disambiguation) and Orbita (disambiguation) . In anatomy, the orbit is the cavity or socket of the skull in which the eye and its appendages are situated. Orbit can refer to the bony socket, or it can also be used to imply the contents. In the adult human, the volume of the orbit is 30 mL, of which the eye occupies 6.5 mL. The orbits are conical or four-sided pyramidal cavities, which open into the midline of the face and point back into the head. Each consists of a base, an apex and four walls. There are two important foramina, or windows, two important fissures, or grooves, and one canal surrounding the globe in the orbit."}, {"url": "https://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/bones-of-the-orbit", "passage_text": "Pathology.
