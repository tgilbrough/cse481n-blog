Marble is a metamorphic rock resulting from regional or at times contact metamorphism of sedimentary carbonate rocks, either limestone or dolostone. This metamorphic process causes a complete recrystallization of the original rock into an interlocking mosaic of calcite and/or dolomite crystals. Marble dust can be combined with cement or synthetic resins to make reconstituted or cultured marble. Places named after the stone include Marble Hill, Manhattan, New York and the town of Marble, Minnesota.

Limestone is mostly calcite or calcium carbonate, CaCO 3. Dolomite CaMg(CO 3) 2 is related to limestone but is rich in magnesium. Marble has a uniform texture (non-foliated). There is a lot of variation in the color and texture of marble. The two main influences are the kind of limestone that makes up the parent rock and the kind and degree of metamorphism."}, {"url": "http://geology.com/rocks/marble.shtml", "passage_text": "Some marble also forms by contact metamorphism when a hot magma body heats adjacent limestone or dolostone. Before metamorphism, the calcite in the limestone is often in the form of lithified fossil material and biological debris. During metamorphism, this calcite recrystallizes and the texture of the rock changes. In the early stages of the limestone-to-marble transformation the calcite crystals in the rock are very small."}, {"url": "http://quatr.us/arts/marble.htm", "passage_text": "Marble is a metamorphic rock made out of limestone. When limestone is subjected to tremendous pressure for a long time (like if limestone is buried under a lot of other rock or an ocean) it gets squashed into marble.
