The plenum spaces are those that lie between a drop and standard ceiling (or a similar version in the floor space) and it is this section where the air in a building circulates, thus aiding in heating and cooling functions.

Vertical section through a commercial building without a plenum airspace. When both the supply and return ducts are constructed in this manner, it is possible to insulate the ducts and the dropped ceiling so that the upper airspace is not heated or cooled, increasing energy efficiency."}, {"url": "http://www.improvenet.com/r/costs-and-prices/return-air-plenums", "passage_text": "Return air plenums are the ducting units used as the central chamber for return air ducting. Furnaces and air handlers should have a return air plenum so that they can operate at their maximum efficiency. Return air plenums recycle the air in a structure back to the air handling unit and exhaust the air out of the home. Generally, a return air plenum will cost approximately $50 to $60 per unit. The other costs to consider are those for the labor and materials needed to install the return air plenum. The installation takes an average of about five hours with the sum of labor costs between $290 and $370."}, {"url": "http://www.hvac-for-beginners.com/hvac-duct.html", "passage_text": "Your hvac duct system is the heart of your home's heating and cooling system. Without a healthy system you could be wasting a lot of money. Like the human body, if the heart isn't healthy you are in trouble. A duct system provides a controlled path for air flow throughout the home. The two main types of supply systems are extended plenum and central plenum. A central plenum system is a system where all of the branch ducts start at the same location called a plenum. The extended plenum system consists of a supply air plenum which is connected to the outlet of the hvac equipment."}, {"url": "http://homeguides.sfgate.com/plenum-hvac-system-87219.html", "passage_text": "Supply Plenum. A plenum is an air-distribution box attached directly to the supply outlet of the HVAC equipment that heats or cools the air to make the house comfortable.
