According to most sources, the human hearing (frequency) range is between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz (bats can hear up to 100,000 Hz!). What does that mean? Sound is a mechanical wave that propagates through a medium (air, water), and the frequency of a sound wave determines its tone and pitch."}, {"url": "http://www.cdc.gov/NCBDDD/hearingloss/sound.html", "passage_text": "Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz). A person who has hearing within the normal range can hear sounds that have frequencies between 20 and 20,000 Hz. The most important sounds we hear every day are in the 250 to 6,000 Hz range. Speech includes a mix of low and high frequency sounds:"}]
