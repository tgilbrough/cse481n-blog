If your employer doesn't offer a 401(k) plan, you typically miss out on a huge opportunity to save money on your taxes while saving for retirement.

Whether to use a Roth or a traditional IRA for those contributions depends on your individual tax situation. Hevert favors the Roth because there is no RMD, so funds can continue to grow throughout retirement and can be tapped at a later date in retirement or left to heirs in an estate. Contributing to an individual retirement account during retirement isn't a strategy many investors adopt, but it can make sense for those still earning income. That's because continuing to fund an IRA on a tax-deferred basis means more money will be available later in retirement."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roth_IRA", "passage_text": "A Roth IRA can be an individual retirement account containing investments in securities, usually common stocks and bonds, often through mutual funds (although other investments, including derivatives, notes, certificates of deposit, and real estate are possible). A Roth IRA can also be an individual retirement annuity, which is an annuity contract or an endowment contract purchased from a life insurance company.
