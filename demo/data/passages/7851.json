Looking at a typical wye connected load, the current flowing down a phase conductor flows through one leg or element of the load into the center conductor or neutral and back to the source. This holds for each of the three phases. Poly-phase circuits are often three-phase circuits in most industrial and commercial electrical distribution systems with wye and delta the most common. Loads in a wye circuits can be connected line-to-neutral as well as line-to-line, which can make the phase power flow calculations a bit confusing."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_difference_between_an_electrical_3-phase_delta_connection_and_a_star_connection", "passage_text": "In a wye system, the supply service line-to-line voltage is 1.73 times the voltage from any phase to neutral.
