Type B blood has anti-type-A antibodies. Type AB blood has no antibodies in the plasma, and type O blood has both anti-type-A and anti-type-B antibodies in the plasma. These antibodies are not present at birth but are formed spontaneously during infancy and last throughout life. There are two antigens, A and B. If you have the A antigen on the RBC, then you have type A blood. When B antigen is present, you have type B blood. When both A and B antigens are present, you have type AB blood. When neither are present, you have type O blood. When an antigen is present on the RBC, then the opposite antibody (also called agglutinin) is present in the plasma"}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_antibodies_are_in_the_plasma_of_type_A-_blood", "passage_text": "People with blood type O do not have any antigen on the RBC membrane.So they can not receive blood from group A&B&AB.Because they have anti_A and anti_B antibodies in their pl \u2026 asma.They can only receive blood from type O. + 3 others found this useful.

The antigens expressed in the red blood cells determine an individual's blood type. Also the combination of some other molecules floating around in the blood plasma differs between the eight blood types, the so called antibodies. Antibodies (in the blood plasma) : A antibodies. If there are B and Rh antigens but no A antigens, the antibodies in the blood plasma are A antibodies. The blood type notation B Rh+ indicates which antigens and antibodies are present in the blood."}]
