This large fan-shaped muscle stretches from the armpit up to the collarbone and down across the lower chest region on both sides of the chest. Injuries to this muscle are rare, but symptoms include pain in the chest, bruising, and decreased strength of the muscle. The pectoralis minor resides under the pectoralis major. This thin triangle-shaped muscle runs up and down along the upper ribs.

And today, we're going to talk about how to tighten the muscles between the armpits and the back. The armpit muscles are called the lats. And this is an important area because they help aid in shoulder movement and rotation. And they help also support us in our posture, in our upper back. To engage the lats, take the left arm up at a right angle.

The back of the arm also contains the triceps. The described area where toning and development is desired is actually located at the separation between the chest muscle and the anterior portion (front) deltoid muscle. The biceps prominence is also located in the armpit region when you hold your arm closer to your body. Doing push-ups is a good way to stimulate your chest, but most people forget that it\u2019s actually predominantly a triceps exercise when performed with your elbows in towards your body. The tricep muscle is located on the back of the arm."}, {"url": "http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-type/breast/anatomy-and-physiology/?region=on", "passage_text": "Each breast lies over a muscle of the chest called the pectoral muscle.
