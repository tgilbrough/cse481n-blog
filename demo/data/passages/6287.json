Infections. Viral infections such as mumps, flu, and others can cause swelling of the salivary glands. Swelling happens in parotid glands on both sides of the face, giving the appearance of chipmunk cheeks.. Salivary gland swelling is commonly associated with mumps, happening in about 30% to 40% of mumps infections. It usually begins approximately 48 hours after the start of other symptoms such as fever and headache. The following are some of the more common salivary gland problems : Salivary stones, or sialoliths. The most common cause of swollen salivary glands, salivary stones are buildups of crystallized saliva deposits. Sometimes salivary stones can block the flow of saliva. When saliva can't exit through the ducts, it backs up into the gland, causing pain and swelling"}, {"url": "http://www.healthguideinfo.com/ear-nose-throat/p101074/", "passage_text": "Mumps is the most common reason for infection of the parotid glands. The condition is most common in children, although adults can also get this infection. Salivary duct stones can cause obstruction to the flow of the saliva. In such cases, the saliva is produced but obstruction prevents it from exiting, causing facial inflammation, pain, and infection in the parotid glands. Infection in the nearby lymph nodes (glands located in the upper neck) can spread to the salivary glands. During an infection, these lymph nodes get enlarged and may cause a red and painful swelling in the parotid glands"}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/salivary-gland-infections", "passage_text": "A salivary gland infection occurs when a bacterial or viral infection affects the salivary gland or duct.
