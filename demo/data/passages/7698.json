Kerosene is an oil distillate commonly used as a fuel or solvent. It is a thin, clear liquid consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons that boil between 302\u00b0F and 527\u00b0F (150\u00b0C and 275\u00b0C). While kerosene can be extracted from coal, oil shale, and wood, it is primarily derived from refined petroleum. Other uses were found for kerosene after the demise of oil lamps, and today it is primarily used in residential heating and as a fuel additive. In the late 1990s, annual production of kerosene had grown to approximately 1 billion gal (3.8 billion 1) in the United States alone."}, {"url": "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kerosene", "passage_text": "Full Definition of KEROSENE. : a flammable hydrocarbon oil usually obtained by distillation of petroleum and used as a fuel, solvent, and thinner.

In parts of Asia, where the price of kerosene is subsidized, it fuels outboard motors on small fishing boats. Today, kerosene is mainly used in fuel for jet engines in several grades. One form of the fuel known as RP-1 is burned with liquid oxygen as rocket fuel.
