So, multiply the average hourly watt hours you need to generate that you got from the last step by something between $7 and $9 and that is what it will cost for solar panels with enough capacity to power your house."}, {"url": "http://canadianhomeworkshop.com/6828/tips-tools/go-solar", "passage_text": "The cost of installing solar power on a mid-sized home is between $30,000 to $40,000 dollars, which covers about 30 panels. If you\u2019re connecting off the grid, expect a higher price tag to cover the cost of extra wiring and materials. Those 30 panels will produce about 8350 kW hours of energy a year or 22 kW hours a day."}, {"url": "http://home.costhelper.com/solar-panels.html", "passage_text": "1 Solar-powered home water heaters cost $1,000-$3,500 (including installation) but have extremely low monthly operating costs and can be used in any climate, according to the US Department of Energy. 2  The cost for a solar heating system can vary widely."}, {"url": "http://www.homesolarandwindinfo.com/solar-panel-cost/", "passage_text": "When people ask the question, \u201cHow much will solar panels cost,\u201d they could really be asking either, \u201cHow much does a solar panel cost,\u201d or \u201cHow much will it cost for enough solar panels to power my house?\u201d. The first question is more directly related to solar panel cost, so we\u2019ll cover that first. The answer is a little tricky because it depends on whether you are planning to buy pre-made solar panels or make them yourself. For premade solar panels, a single panel can cost about $900, or $12 per watt. A medium sized system to provide power to a small or very energy efficient house might cost $25,000 and a solar system to power a large house could cost $50,000+."}]
