Fig. 1.2 shows schematically the difference between both recording solutions. In the case of longitudinal recording the grains magnetization is lying in the plane of the magnetic medium. When the medium is magnetized by the recording head, the average magnetization is pointing in the down-track direction (see Fig 1.2). Magnetic recording is one of the most important examples of working nanotechnology. Here we will mostly be concerned with the hard disk magnetic storage. The magnetic information in the hard disk is stored in ``bits'' which are patterns of magnetization in a magnetizable material to store data."}, {"url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304885304010819", "passage_text": "This space is air in the longitudinal case.

In longitudinal waves, oscillations occur parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave. The most common example for these types of waves is sound waves, which consist of oscillating air molecules."}]
