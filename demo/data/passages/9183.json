The Earths crust is the outermost layer of our planet and is less than 1% of the Earth's volume. The crust and the mantle contain different kinds of rocks making them chemically different. The upper mantle rocks are primarily peridotite.

It's thinner, denser, and simpler in structure than the continental crust. Oceanic crust is also younger, on average; from its birth at a mid-ocean ridge to its end at a subduction zone is no more than 250 million years. "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_%28geology%29", "passage_text": "The internal structure of Earth. The crust of the Earth is composed of a great variety of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. The crust is underlain by the mantle. The upper part of the mantle is composed mostly of peridotite, a rock denser than rocks common in the overlying crust. The boundary between the crust and mantle is conventionally placed at the Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity, a boundary defined by a contrast in seismic velocity. The crust occupies less than 1% of Earth's volume. The oceanic crust of the sheet is different from its continental crust. The crust forms in part by aggregation of island arcs including granite and metamorphic fold belts, and it is preserved in part by depletion of the underlying mantle to form buoyant lithospheric mantle."}, {"url": "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Earth's+crust", "passage_text": "Noun. 1.
