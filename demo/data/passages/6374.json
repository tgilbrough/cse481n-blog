Gamekeeper\u2019s thumb is a repetitive stress injury of the ulnar collateral ligament\u2014tough fibrous tissue that connects the bones at the base of the thumb.

The purpose of the UCL is to keep the thumb stable in order to pinch objects. Skier's thumb got its name because this injury frequently happens during skiing accidents during which a person falls and doesn't let go of the ski pole. The thumb is jerked away from the index finger, stretching or even completely tearing the ulnar collateral ligament."}, {"url": "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gamekeeper", "passage_text": "Full Definition of GAMEKEEPER. : a person in charge of the breeding and protection of game animals or birds on a private preserve.

The UCL is torn at (or in some cases even avulsed from) its insertion site into the proximal phalanx of the thumb in the vast majority (approximately 90%) of cases. This condition is commonly observed among gamekeepers and Scottish fowl hunters, as well as athletes (such as volleyballers). Symptoms and signs [edit]. Symptoms of gamekeeper's thumb are instability of the MCP joint of the thumb, accompanied by pain and weakness of the pinch grasp."}, {"url": "http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1239413-overview", "passage_text": "History of the Procedure. Gamekeeper's thumb is a clinical instability of the first metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint caused by an insufficiency of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in the MCP of the thumb. Gamekeeper's thumb is caused by a valgus force that is directed on the MCP joint of the thumb and produces a failure of the UCL. Falls on an abducted thumb and the fall of a skier against a planted ski pole are common mechanisms.
