It is typically given to two decimal places. 240 divided by 180 = 1.33). The result, both ways, suggests that for every full game you play, you allow 1.33 goals.

GAA is analogous to a baseball pitcher 's earned run average (ERA). In Japanese, the same translation (\u9632\u5fa1\u7387) is used for both GAA and ERA, because of this. For ice hockey, it is calculated per game by dividing the number of goals against by the number of minutes played in the game then multiplied by 60. For a season, divide the total number of goals against by the result of the total number of minutes played (also known as time on ice) multiplied by 60. Since the statistic is highly dependent on the team playing in front of a goalie, save percentage is usually considered a more accurate measure of a goaltender's skill, especially in ice hockey and lacrosse, as it takes into account the number of shots the goaltender has faced."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070203150014AAu04xl", "passage_text": "GAA It is calculated by dividing the number of minutes played by 60 minutes(one game) then dividing the goals against by that answer.

Say that season, in 10 games, I allowed 51 goals in 395 minutes (it's roller hockey, so it's going to be higher in my example, apply your stats as appropriate): (45/395) x 51 = 5.81 GAA You will need to know minutes and seconds and convert to a decimal to do this accurately."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080827171324AAGQ9mD", "passage_text": "GAA requires that you check out how many minutes the goalie has played. GAA = (Goals allowed * 60)/ minutes played For example. If a goalie has given up 3 goals and then gets pulled for the final minute, his GAA is not 3.00. It would actually be 3.05. Same thing for if a goalie gets pulled at intermission. For the save percentage you divide the number of saves by the number of shots. For EX. 24/25 = 96% For goals against Average you divide the number of goals against by the number of games played. For EX. 80/46=1.74 GAA.

This is the number of goals allowed per 60 minutes played, rounded to two decimal points. The Formula: multiply the number of goals allowed by 60 and divide by the total number of minutes played. The Example: If you allowed 4 goals in 180 minutes your GAA is 1.33 (4 times 60 = 240. 240 divided by 180 = 1.33). The result suggests that for every full game you play, you allow 1.33 goals. This number expresses a goalie's success based on the number of shots he faces. The Formula: Divide the number saves made by the number of shots on goal. Work it out to 3 decimal places. The Example: If you faced 45 shots and allowed 5 goals, your save percentage is .888 (40 saves divided by 45 shots = .888)."}]
