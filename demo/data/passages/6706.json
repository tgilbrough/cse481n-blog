If homosexuality were genetic, identical co-twins of homosexual men and women would also be homosexual 100% of the time. In classic twin studies the genetic fraction is less than 23% for men and 37% for women, and may be as low as 10%."}, {"url": "http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/anderson.cooper.360/blog/2007/02/can-people-change-from-gay-to-straight.html", "passage_text": "You are all buffoons.
