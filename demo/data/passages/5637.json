Collectively these are sometimes referred to as the coinage metals, although in modern times these metals are used less frequently than in the past. Copper is one of the most important metals. Copper is reddish with a bright metallic lustre. It is malleable, ductile, and a good conductor of heat and electricity (second only to silver in electrical conductivity). Its alloys, brass and bronze, are very important. Monel and gun metals also contain copper."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "passage_text": "Copper is a chemical element with symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29. It is a ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Pure copper is soft and malleable; a freshly exposed surface has a reddish-orange color. There are 29 isotopes of copper. 63 Cu and 65 Cu are stable, with 63 Cu comprising approximately 69% of naturally occurring copper; they both have a spin of 3\u20442.
