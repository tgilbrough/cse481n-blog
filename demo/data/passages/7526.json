Old cattle (bulls and cows), commonly referred to as canners or cutters, are generally slaughtered promptly after purchase. Breed type of the animal is an important factor in the slaughter age. British-type cattle (Angus, Hereford, Shorthorn) reach puberty earlier and are much more feed efficient than cattle of American (Brahman, Beefmaster, Santa Gertrudis, etc.) or Continental (Limousin, Charloais) influence/ lineage.

The carcass weight of a slaughtered steer is often 50% of its live weight. Cows (like the mature bovine one I mentioned earlier) get slaughtered when they are no longer productive to a breeding herd, which can range from 2 to over 20 years of age.

This is because there are variations in how cattle are finished due to their breeding, genetics and sex.
