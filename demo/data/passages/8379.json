A basic metabolic panel is a blood test that measures your sugar (glucose) level, electrolyte and fluid balance, and kidney function. Glucose is a type of sugar your body uses for energy. Electrolytes keep your body's fluids in balance. Your doctor also may order this panel as part of a regular health examination or to help diagnose a medical condition.

It can also be used to monitor hospitalized patients and people with certain known conditions, such as hypertension and hypokalemia. The panel is also often ordered in the hospital emergency room setting because its components give health practitioners important information about the current status of a person's kidneys, electrolyte and acid/base balance, and blood glucose and calcium levels."}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/basic-metabolic-panel", "passage_text": "The basic metabolic panel can give your doctor a good idea if you have any serious problems with: 1  blood filtration. 2  acid/base balance of your blood. 3  blood sugar levels. 4  electrolyte levels.

Chloride. Glucose, or blood sugar, is a key source of energy for your body, but too much or too little can be a problem. Potassium. This mineral plays a leading role in cell health. Sodium.
