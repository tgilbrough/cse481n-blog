Normally, when you cut yourself, substances in the blood known as clotting factors combine with blood cells called platelets to make the blood sticky. This makes the bleeding stop eventually."}, {"url": "http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hemophilia", "passage_text": "Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder that slows the blood clotting process.
