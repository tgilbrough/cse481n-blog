[{"url": "http://www.careerprofiles.info/aerospace-engineer.html", "passage_text": "How to Become an Aerospace Engineer. A bachelor's degree is typically required to start out in aerospace engineering. Students who want to become an aerospace engineer should study physics, chemistry, and higher mathematics, such as trigonometry, algebra, and calculus. Certain universities also offer five-year programs in aerospace engineering. Students who complete these programs receive not only a bachelor's degree, but a master's degree as well. Engineers who hold a master's degree or higher are able to teach at universities and work on research and development projects."}, {"url": "http://study.com/articles/Aeronautical_Engineer_Educational_Requirements.html", "passage_text": "Educational Requirements. In order to become an aeronautical engineer, prospective candidates must complete a bachelor's degree program, usually in aerospace or aeronautical engineering. A program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) may be required to later earn licensure. Once EITs have completed the required experience, they may take the second exam to become professional aeronautical engineers. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), job opportunities for aerospace engineers were projected to increase 7% from 2012-2022, which is slower than average."}, {"url": "http://learn.org/articles/What_are_the_Requirements_for_Becoming_an_Engineer_in_the_US.html", "passage_text": "Engineers in the United States need a bachelor's degree in engineering. Engineers who work with the public are also required to become licensed. Licensure requirements include completing an accredited program and passing a series of exams. Job Requirements. The requirements to become an engineer typically include a bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline, though a master's degree may be needed for advancement in some fields."}, {"url": "http://www.skillchart.com/careers/engineering/aerospace.htm", "passage_text": "Aerospace engineers can also work for their respective governments such as NASA in the U.S. Education Required. To become an aerospace engineer requires a technical degree in engineering.
