Eastern Australia was not discovered until 1770 and the Arctic and Antarctic areas were not heavily explored until the 19th century. Many nations were looking for goods such as silver and gold but one of the biggest reasons for exploration was the desire to find a new route for the spice and silk trades. When the Ottoman Empire took control of Constantinople in 1453, it blocked European access to the area, severely limiting trade."}, {"url": "http://loc.gov/rr/hispanic/portam/role.html", "passage_text": "Portugal, the western-most European country, was one of the primary players in the European Age of Discovery and Exploration. Under the leadership of Prince Henry the Navigator, Portugal took the principal role during most of the fifteenth century in searching for a route to Asia by sailing south around Africa. In the last decade of the fifteenth century, Christopher Columbus set out on a westerly course across the Atlantic Ocean searching for an alternative route to the Indies but inadvertently discovered a new continent. Although neither Portuguese-born nor sponsored, Columbus was Portuguese trained."}, {"url": "http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/Europeweb/factfile/Unique-facts-Europe7.htm", "passage_text": "The so-called Age of Exploration was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century, during which European ships were traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning capitalism in Europe.

It was the period in which global exploration started with the Portuguese discovery of the Atlantic archipelago of the Azores, the western coast of Africa, and discovery of the ocean route to the East in 1498, and the trans-Atlantic Ocean discovery of the Americas on behalf of the Crown of Castile (Spain) in 1492."}, {"url": "http://www.mysocialstudiesclass.com/AGEOFEXPLORATION.pdf", "passage_text": "THE AGE OF EXPLORATION 1492-1650 BACKGROUND MOTIVATION Economic and political motives.
