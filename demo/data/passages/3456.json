It occurs as a colorless liquid with a petrol-like odor. Its melting point is \u221294 \u00b0C and its boiling point is 49 \u00b0C. Cyclopentane is in the class of cycloalkanes, being alkanes that have one or more rings of carbon atoms. The typical structure of cyclopentane is the envelope conformation. It is formed by cracking cyclohexane in the presence of alumina at a high temperature and pressur"}, {"url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Organic_Chemistry/Cycloalkanes", "passage_text": "Torsional strain is also a factor. When the hydrogen bonds in a ring eclipse each other, this creates additional strain. In the case of cyclopropane the hydrogens eclipse each other, greatly adding to the strain. In fact, this is the cause of most of the strain found in cyclopentane. Cyclopentane has bond angles very close to 109.5\u00b0, but because 4 of its carbons are planar, there it has torsional strain that makes it less stable.
