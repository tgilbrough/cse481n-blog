In genetics, a deletion (also called gene deletion, deficiency, or deletion mutation) (sign: \u03b4) is a mutation (a genetic aberration) in which a part of a chromosome or a sequence of DNA is lost during DNA replication. Any number of nucleotides can be deleted, from a single base to an entire piece of chromosome. The smallest single base deletion mutations are believed occur by a single base flipping in the template DNA, followed by template DNA strand slippage, within the DNA polymerase active site."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_deletion_mutation", "passage_text": "The addition or deletion of a nucleotide can lead to a Frameshift mutation.

"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_mutations", "passage_text": "Mutation can result in several different types of change in sequences. Mutations in genes can either have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning properly or completely. Mutations can also occur in nongenic regions. In biology, a mutation is a permanent change of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of an organism, virus, or extrachromosomal DNA or other genetic elements."}, {"url": "http://greengenes.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/JD_Tutorial/nph-Mutations.cgi", "passage_text": "Of the three types of point mutations the most harmful are insertions and deletions. They result in what is known as a frameshift mutation. When a nucleotide base is either inserted or deleted it disrupts the amino acids coded for from the site of the mutation on to the end of the gene.
