The keys to this definition are the chemical composition and the crystalline structure. Different chemical compositions result in different minerals. A good example is the mineral plagioclase."}, {"url": "http://www.earthlyrocks.com/info-minerals.htm", "passage_text": "A mineral is a naturally occurring substance formed through geological processes that has a characteristic chemical composition, an ordered atomic structure and specific physical properties.
