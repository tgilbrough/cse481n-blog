It's entirely possible that your hard drive failed or was failing, but it is coincidental that it did so in their hands. They are struggling to justify their existence. In my case the Geek Squad had my computer for two weeks, charged me 3 hours labor. I have changed graphics cards and associted software and drivers out in 30 minutes. They also chargeds me for a new graphics card and I ended up fixing their mistakes.

Best Answer: Go to best buy and take a look at their sign with the repair cost.It is ridiculous,please don't go there,they charge and arm and a leg for simple tasks.Find a computer guy in your local paper.They are cheap and they even come to your house for no extra cost.

And then they'll try to sell you antivirus and antispyware, which is another $99. I'd recommend you do the backup yourself and then just have them clean the computer."}, {"url": "http://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/am-i-being-ripped-off-by-geek-squad-298746/", "passage_text": "The Geek Squad is there to get you to buy a new computer from Best Buy.
