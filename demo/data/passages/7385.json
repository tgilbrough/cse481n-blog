But, when you lay it out butterflied, it\u2019s thinner and more of the meat is exposed to heat, so if you were to cook it at 350 degrees at a 1/2 hour/lb. a 6 lb roast would end up ruinously overdone."}, {"url": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/herb-crusted-pork-tenderloin-recipe.html", "passage_text": "Place the pork loin on a rack in a roasting pan.

When you take the roast out of the oven it will continue to cook for a while (that's called carry over) and after resting for 15 - 20 minutes it will reach the perfect temperature of 150 - 155 degrees. For a pork loin roast @ 275 degrees, cooking time is about. one hour and 45 minutes. My personal favorite temperature is cooking @ 225 degrees.. Think about it as the way BBQ Pit Masters ply their trade."}]
