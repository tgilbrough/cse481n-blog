Beta thalassemia occurs when one or both of the two genes that make beta-globin don't work or only partly work as they should. 1  If you have one damaged gene, you may have mild anemia and probably won't need treatment. 2  This is called beta thalassemia minor or beta thalassemia trait."}, {"url": "http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/hematology_and_blood_disorders/beta_thalassemia_cooleys_anemia_85,P00081/", "passage_text": "Thalassemia is an inherited disorder that affects the production of normal hemoglobin (a type of iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the tissues of the body).

Beta thalassemias (\u03b2 thalassemias) are a group of inherited blood disorders. They are caused by reduced or absent synthesis of the beta chains of hemoglobin that result in variable outcomes ranging from severe anemia to clinically asymptomatic individuals. Beta thalassemia (\u03b2 thalassemia) is a form of thalassemia caused by mutations in the HBB gene on chromosome 11, inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The severity of the disease depends on the nature of the mutation.

Thalassemia (thal-uh-SEE-me-uh) is an inherited blood disorder characterized by less hemoglobin and fewer red blood cells in your body than normal.

Hemoglobin is the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body. In people with beta thalassemia, low levels of hemoglobin lead to a lack of oxygen in many parts of the body. Affected individuals also have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), which can cause pale skin, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications. Beta thalassemia is classified into two types depending on the severity of symptoms: thalassemia major (also known as Cooley's anemia) and thalassemia intermedia. Of the two types, thalassemia major is more severe. The signs and symptoms of thalassemia major appear within the first 2 years of life."}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/thalassemia", "passage_text": "Thalassemia is a blood disorder passed down through families (inherited) in which the body makes an abnormal form of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.
