The main difference between the leg seen in niacin deficiency and perosis as seen in manganese and choline deficiency is that with niacin deficiency the Achilles tendon seldom slips from its condyles. In the niacin-deficient hen, weight loss, reduced egg production, and a marked decrease in hatchability can result.

Lack of it can cause leg problems in ducklings and goslings. Treatment: Ducklings exhibiting niacin deficiencies and be CURED by giving them 100-150 mg. niacin (crush tablet) per gallon until they are 8 - 10 weeks old.

We do know that ducks have a higher requirement for niacin than chickens. NRC requirements for ducklings = 55 mg/kg niacin compared to only 27-35 mg/kg for chicks. On top of that, the niacin in corn has a very low bioavailability; although corn contains 24 mg/kg of niacin, I use a value of 2 mg/kg for formulation. Typically the pills contain 500 mgs of niacin per tablet. Assuming a duck is eating about .35 lbs per day (this is how much a Pekin is eating at about 3 -4 weeks of age) , they need 10 milligrams (mgs) of niacin a day.
