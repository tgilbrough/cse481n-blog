This layer is typically a few hundred meters to 2 km (1.2 mi) deep depending on the landform and time of day.

The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere and site of all weather on Earth. The troposphere is bonded on the top by a layer of air called the tropopause, which separates the troposphere from the stratosphere, and on bottom by the surface of the Earth. Temperature and water vapor content in the troposphere decrease rapidly with altitude. Water vapor plays a major role in regulating air temperature because it absorbs solar energy and thermal radiation from the planet's surface. The troposphere contains 99% of the water vapor in the atmosphere."}, {"url": "http://scied.ucar.edu/shortcontent/troposphere-overview", "passage_text": "The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere.
