A: If the animation does not work on your train set, turn the train car upside down and make sure that the wheels of your train car are making contact with the gears underneath the train car. If your engine still does not have power, check to make sure that the plug that goes from the tender to the engine is fully seated. Finally, make sure that the battery contacts in the tender car are clean of any debris or corrosion."}, {"url": "http://www.trainelectronics.com/Meter_Workshop/", "passage_text": "You can perform a better test with 1.5 volt and 9 volt batteries. Do not use this method with other types of batteries! Move the meter's selector to the battery test position in the upper right between ACV and DCA. Again touch the red probe to the positive terminal and the black to the negative. The display should show about 9 volts depending on the condition of the battery. Repeat the test with a 1.5 volt AA battery. If you inadvertently connect the probes to the incorrect terminals the display will show a negative voltage. This will not damage the meter. Note: Measuring battery voltage in this way does not really perform a very good test as the batteries are not under load"}, {"url": "http://www.wikihow.com/%22Train%22-a-Cellphone-or-Laptop-Battery", "passage_text": "1. Make sure the battery is completely exhausted. Let your electronic device turn off by itself once the battery is dead. It is important to start the process from this position because what you are really doing here is calibrating your device to know how much juice is in the battery. 2. Plug your device in and let it charge until it signifies you have charged it completely. Four bars on a cell phone, full battery on a laptop, whatever it may say, it is probably wrong-and you should be able to tell because the device will not hold a charge for as long as you would like."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_locomotive", "passage_text": "An electric locomotive is a locomotive powered by electricity from overhead lines, a third rail or on-board energy storage such as a battery or fuel cell.
