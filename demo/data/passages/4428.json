Muscle cells make this enzyme. When muscle cells are injured or diseased, enzymes leak out of the cells and enter the bloodstream. You have a muscle disease. If your CK level is high, the test may be repeated (as often as every 8 hours) to see if the injury is healing or getting worse.

An elevation beyond this point is likely to be diagnostically relevant. The creatine kinase test is a standard test that is conducted using a blood sample. For the patient, there is no difference from a normal blood test that might be conducted in a clinic.

CK is a type of protein. The muscle cells in your body need CK to function. Levels of CK can rise after a heart attack, skeletal muscle injury, strenuous exercise, or drinking too much alcohol, and from taking certain medicines or supplements. If this test shows that your CK levels are high, you may have muscle or heart damage. CK is made up of three enzyme forms. These are CK-MB, CK-MM, and CK-BB. CK-MB is the substance that rises if your heart muscle is damaged. CK-MM rises with other muscle damage. CK-BB is found mostly in the brai"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine_kinase", "passage_text": ") This test is not specific for the type of CK that is elevated.

Creatine kinase formerly known as creatine phosphokinase is primarily found in muscle cells including the heart, striated muscles and the brain. The normal range of creatine kinase for men is 38 - 174 units/L and for women 96 - 140 units/L. Men typically have more muscle mass than women which accounts for the higher range values. African Americans have been found to have higher normal range for creatine kinase as well"}]
