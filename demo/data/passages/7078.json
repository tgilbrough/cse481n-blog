High humidity and low temperatures can cause food to dry too slowly encouraging the growth of microorganisms. If you don\u2019t have a food dehydrator, oven drying works well if you can set the oven to a temperature of 140\u00b0 to 150\u00b0F. Open the oven door about 2 inches to allow moisture to escape. A convection oven works well because it combines low heat with a fan to move the air."}, {"url": "http://www.pickyourown.org/dryingfoods.htm", "passage_text": "1 Foods can be dried in a conventional oven, a commercial dehydrator, or in the sun. 2  Drying times vary with the method and foods chosen. 3  Be sure to read the instructions with your dehydrator. 4  Maintain 130F to 140F with circulating air: Remove enough moisture as quickly as possible to prevent spoilage."}, {"url": "http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/food/food_safety/preservation/hgic3080.html", "passage_text": "When the food is ready for use, the water is added back and the food returns to its original shape.
