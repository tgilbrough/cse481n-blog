In people without a change in glucokinase, the blood glucose is usually around 5.5 mmol/L but in people with a change in the glucokinase gene, the fasting blood glucose is typically between 5.5 and 8mmol/L."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090501104224AAX1SMc", "passage_text": "\u00b7 just now. Report Abuse. Hexokinase is the enzyme which phosphorylates hexose (six-carbon sugar). Glucokinase is a type of hexokinase (hexokinase IV), that specifically phosphorylates glucose (a hexose sugar) when it is present in high titre level. In the process of glycolysis in liver cells glucose is converted to glucose 6 phosphate by glucokinase (a hexokinase). It is Glucokinase that turns Glucose into Glucose-6-phosphate. And a hexokinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates a six-carbon sugar, a hexose, to a hexose phosphate."}, {"url": "http://www.proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Kyle_Schroering_Sandbox", "passage_text": "Glucokinase (hexokinase D) is a monomeric cytoplasmic enzyme found in the liver and pancreas that serves to regulate glucose levels in these organs. Glucokinase is used in the first step of the metabolism of glucose, during this step the phosphorylation of glucose by ATP generates glucose-6-phosphate and ADP. Glucokinase vs. Other Hexokinases: Glucokinase is unique from other hexokinase in kinetic properties and is coded by a different gene. The difference of glucokinase from the other hexokinases is that glucokinase has a lower affinity, thus a higher Km, for glucose."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexokinase", "passage_text": "A hexokinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates hexoses (six-carbon sugars), forming hexose phosphate. In most organisms, glucose is the most important substrate of hexokinases, and glucose-6-phosphate the most important product. Hexokinase can transfer an inorganic phosphate group from ATP to a substrate. Hexokinases should not be confused with glucokinase, which is a specific isoform of hexokinase."}, {"url": "http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P35557", "passage_text": "Catalyzes the initial step in utilization of glucose by the beta-cell and liver at physiological glucose concentration.
