There are three major alveolar cell types in the alveolar wall (pneumocytes): 1 Type I pneumocyte (Squamous Alveolar) cells that form the structure of an alveolar wall. 2  Type II pneumocyte (Great Alveolar) cells that secrete pulmonary surfactant to lower the surface tension of water and allows the membrane to separate, thereby increasing the capability to exchange gases."}, {"url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6598039", "passage_text": "The alveolar epithelium comprises two main cell types: the alveolar type I and alveolar type II cell. The type I cell is a complex branched cell with multiple cytoplasmic plates that are greatly attenuated and relatively devoid of organelles; these plates represent the gas exchange surface in the alveolus. On the other hand, the type II cell acts as the caretaker of the alveolar compartment"}, {"url": "http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/ptens2.html", "passage_text": "Respiratory System. The oxygen exchange in the lungs takes place across the membranes of small balloon-like structures called alveoli attached to the branches of the bronchial passages. These alveoli inflate and deflate with inhalation and exhalation. The behavior of the alveoli is largely dictated by LaPlace's law and surface tension. It takes some effort to breathe in because these tiny balloons must be inflated, but the elastic recoil of the tiny balloons assists us in the process of exhalation. This fluid, called a surfactant, lowers the surface tension of the balloon-like alveoli by about a factor of 15 compared to the normal mucous tissue fluid in which they are immersed."}, {"url": "http://www.easynotecards.com/notecard_set/3494", "passage_text": "76. alveolar sac. A cluster of alveoli located at the end of each alveolar duct in the lungs; each of the alveoli is a tiny, thin-walled, capillary-rich sac, lined by a simple squamous epithelium, where the exchange (diffusion) of oxygen and carbon dioxide (and other less important gases) takes place.
