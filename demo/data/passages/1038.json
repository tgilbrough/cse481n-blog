[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology", "passage_text": "In western philosophy, the term and concept of teleology originated in the writings of Plato and Aristotle. Aristotle's Four Causes give special place to each thing's telos or final cause.. In this, he followed Plato in seeing purpose in both human and sub-human nature. It is derived from two Greek words: telos (end, goal, purpose) and logos (reason, explanation). A purpose that is imposed by a human use, such as that of a fork, is called extrinsic. Natural teleology contends that natural entities have intrinsic purposes, irrespective of human use or opinion."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology", "passage_text": "Teleology is a reason or explanation for something in function of its end, purpose, or goal.

In his Physics, Aristotle examines the theories and ideas regarding nature of his predecessors and then, based upon his own ideas, theories and experiments, argues against what he believes are incorrect conclusions. One idea that Aristotle argues specifically is teleology. Teleology is the idea that natural phenomena are determined not only by mechanical causes but by an overall design or purpose in nature. In this essay, I will examine what Aristotle's concept of teleology was and look at why he held this conception. First, let's talk about what we mean by teleology. Teleology is the study of ends, purposes, and goals. The word comes from the Greek word telos which means end or purpose. In cultures which have a teleological world view, the ends of things are seen as providing the meaning for all that has happened or that occurs."}, {"url": "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/teleology", "passage_text": "Medical Definition of TELEOLOGY. 1. a: the study of evidences of design in nature b: a doctrine (as in vitalism) that ends are immanent in nature c: a doctrine explaining phenomena by final causes. 2. : the fact or character attributed to nature or natural processes of being directed toward an end or shaped by a purpose."}, {"url": "https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Teleology", "passage_text": "Teleology.
