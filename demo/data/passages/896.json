An extra chrominance signal is added by superimposing a 3.579545 MHz sine wave onto the standard black-and-white signal. Right after the horizontal sync pulse, eight cycles of a 3.579545 MHz sine wave are added as a color burst. Following these eight cycles, a phase shift in the chrominance signal indicates the color to display. The amplitude of the signal determines the saturation. Here is the relationship between color and phase: 1  Burst = 0 degrees. 2  Yellow = 15 degrees. 3  Red = 75 degrees. 4  Magenta = 135 degrees"}, {"url": "http://www.bluejeanscable.com/articles/signalconnector.htm", "passage_text": "2.

The colors used in today's signals are green, yellow, red, lunar, and white (remember, we're talking about signals in North America). The color of a signal tells the engineer what he has to do, the location of that color, determines the speed at which he is allowed to do it. We will get to the speed thing in a minute."}, {"url": "http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/tv11.htm", "passage_text": "A black-and-white TV filters out and ignores the chrominance signal. A color TV picks it out of the signal and decodes it, along with the normal intensity signal, to determine how to modulate the three color beams.
