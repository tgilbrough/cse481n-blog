PAGE 1 2. SIGN IN SAVE TO MY DU PRINT AAA. The incubation period for waterfowl lasts from 21 to 31 days, and females spend from 73 to more than 99 percent of each day on the nest. In the extreme case of emperor geese, females spend as much as 99.5 percent of each day on the nest. This leaves a mere seven minutes a day for other activities such as feeding.

For instance, they eat grass, as do geese, have a similarly long egg incubation period of 35 days (compared with 28 days for ducks), and they don't quack. This is a good trait since they are quiet ducks. The male has a low breathy call, and the female a quiet trilling coo.

If you have other duck eggs that you want to add to the Muscovy's clutch, wait a week and make sure the eggs are warm when you slip them under. If you keep the water temperature at a steady 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the incubation period for a goldfish is about five days.

The normal incubation period for a wood duck is usually 29 -30 days. You will have to get an accurate egg count and note the date sometime during the egg laying stage, before the hen starts her incubation. When the entire clutch of eggs has been laid, the hen will begin full-time incubation. This assures that all the eggs have a good chance to hatch together on the same day. During the incubation period, the hen will leave the nest box twice daily to feed (morning and evening) for about 30 minutes."}, {"url": "http://www.grit.com/animals/duck-hatching-our-morning-surprise.aspx", "passage_text": "We have two ducks sitting on eggs right now.
