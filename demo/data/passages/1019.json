In developing countries, malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, and severe measles are common. For these situations, the treatment of measles should include vitamin A medication for two days, starting as soon as a measles diagnosis is made.

There is currently no proven treatment that can kill the measles virus; therefore, measles treatment focuses on providing relief of measles symptoms as the body fights the virus."}, {"url": "http://www.howmuchisit.org/measles-vaccine-cost/", "passage_text": "The price of measles vaccine depends on the medical facility where it will be administered as well as other factors. 1  On average, the measles vaccination can cost anywhere from $18 to as much as $118. 1 Many policies may cover the vaccine as it is considered preventative. 2  According to the site CDC.gov, the price for a measles vaccine can range from $18 to $50. 3  Measlesinitiative.org states that the price for a measles vaccine can be anywhere from $18 to $60."}, {"url": "http://www.howmuchisit.org/measles-vaccine-cost/", "passage_text": "1 On average, the measles vaccination can cost anywhere from $18 to as much as $118. 2  For those that have health insurance policies, check with the policy to learn more about your coverage. 3  Many policies may cover the vaccine as it is considered preventative. 1 Many policies may cover the vaccine as it is considered preventative. 2  According to the site CDC.gov, the price for a measles vaccine can range from $18 to $50. 3  Measlesinitiative.org states that the price for a measles vaccine can be anywhere from $18 to $60."}, {"url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12241559", "passage_text": "The objective of this study is to develop a model to estimate the average cost per measles case and per adverse event following measles immunisation using the Netherlands (NL), the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada as examples.
