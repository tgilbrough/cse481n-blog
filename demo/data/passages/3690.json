Resistant starch has a small particle size, white appearance, bland flavor and low water-holding capacity. Resistant starch typically replaces flour in foods such as bread and other baked goods, pasta, cereal and batters because it can produce foods with similar color and texture of the original food."}, {"url": "http://chriskresser.com/how-resistant-starch-will-help-to-make-you-healthier-and-thinner/", "passage_text": "Resistant starch is a type of starch that is not digested in the stomach or small intestine, reaching the colon intact. Thus, it \u201cresists\u201d digestion. This explains why we do not see spikes in either blood glucose or insulin after eating RS, and why we do not obtain significant calories from RS.

This may lead to some unique health benefits. They\u2019re less likely to spike blood glucose or insulin. Thus, resistant starch is so named because it resists digestion. While most starches are broken down by enzymes in our small intestine into sugar, which is then absorbed into the blood, we can\u2019t fully absorb all kinds of starch. Some starch \u2014 known as resistant starch (RS) \u2014 isn\u2019t fully absorbed in the small intestine. Instead, RS makes its way to the large intestine (colon), where intestinal bacteria ferment it. RS is similar to fiber (see All About Fiber), although nutrition labels rarely take RS into account"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistant_starch", "passage_text": "Some types of resistant starch (RS1, RS2 and RS3) are fermented by the large intestinal microbiota, conferring benefits to human health through the production of short-chain fatty acids, increased bacterial mass, and promotion of butyrate-producing bacteria.

Resistant starch is a low-viscous type of dietary fiber found in carbohydrate-rich foods. As the name suggests, it resists digestion in the small intestines and ferments in the large intestines. Some studies have shown that resistant starch may help weight loss because it can increase fullness that leads to reduced food intake. There is also evidence that resistant starch reduces insulin resistance and improves blood glucose control."}, {"url": "http://www.marksdailyapple.com/the-definitive-guide-to-resistant-starch/", "passage_text": "RS Type 3 \u2013 Retrograded starch; when some starches have been cooked, cooling them (fridge or freezer) changes the structure and makes it more resistant to digestion; found in cooked and cooled potatoes, grains, and beans.

How much resistant starch is best for you (and in what form) really depends on your personal tolerance and gut health.
