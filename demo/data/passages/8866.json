Nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, was discovered as an anesthetic by English chemist Humphry Davy (1791\u20131867) in 1799. The patient cried out in pain and, as a result, another 20 years passed before nitrous oxide was accepted for use as an anesthetic. The first use of ether as an anesthetic during an operation was claimed by surgeon Crawford W. Long (1815\u20131878) of Georgia in 1842."}, {"url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/the-painful-story-behind-modern-anesthesia/", "passage_text": "An illustration of the first use of ether as an anesthetic in 1846 by the dental surgeon W.T.G.
