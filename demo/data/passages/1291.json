Poured retaining walls with elaborate curves require complex formwork and will drive up cost for a wall. The total cost to have a concrete retaining wall installed will be a combination of material and labor prices. For a basic wall you can expect to pay between $30 and $40 per square foot. If you add a decorative finish, curves, steps, lighting or other upgrades, the cost will rise. For Ralston, $39 per square foot is the average cost he charges for a wall under 4 feet tall. For walls below 4 feet, he says his prices are often competitive with finished block. A block wall has to be stuccoed or finished with veneer, while a concrete wall does not need an added finish."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_average_cost_of_concrete_footings_per_lineal_foot", "passage_text": "According t \u2026 o www.doityourself.com a yard of concrete will cost about $75.00 so a cubic foot will cost you $75/27, which would be about $2.78 per cubic foot. 1 foot of concrete is a very small volume so you will probably be charged for a minimum quantity which will be more that the cost of 1 foot.
