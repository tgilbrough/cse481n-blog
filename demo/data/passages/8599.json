Tellurium production is mainly a byproduct of copper processing. The 1960's brought growth in thermoelectric applications for tellurium, as well as its use in free-machining steel, which became the dominant use.

A brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur. It is occasionally found in native form, as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far more common in the universe as a whole than it is on Earth. Naturally occurring tellurium has eight isotopes. Five of those isotopes, 122 Te, 123 Te, 124 Te, 125 Te and 126 Te, are stable.
