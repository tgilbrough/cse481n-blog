The oxide has a very high melting point making it useful in nuclear work as well as having ceramic applications. Biological role. Beryllium and its compounds are toxic and carcinogenic. At one time it was even thought that beryllium powder would be used as a fuel for rockets on account of the colossal amount of heat which it releases when it is burnt.

It has exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a reasonably high melting point. The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 50% greater than that of steel. Beryllium is found in over 100 minerals, but most are uncommon to rare. The more common beryllium containing minerals include: bertrandite (Be 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2), beryl (Al 2 Be 3 Si 6 O 18), chrysoberyl (Al 2 BeO 4) and phenakite (Be 2 SiO 4).

In nuclear reactors, beryllium metal and beryllium oxide are used to control fission reactions. Beryllium has also been used in the trigger mechanisms for nuclear weapons. Two minerals, bertrandite and beryl, are mined for beryllium, and both are found in association with igneous rocks. All the beryllium currently being mined in the United States comes from the mineral bertrandite."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_beryllium_used_for", "passage_text": "A longer answer. Beryllium enjoys wide use as an alloying metal. Beryllium-copper is used to make electrical contacts, welding electrodes, non-sparking and non-magnetic tools, and also springs (for examples springs for Swiss watches, from the alloy glycodur) . In its pure form, it is used as a nozzle in some rocket engines. Also beryllium is the brazing metal for components from zirconium alloys (for example in the fabrication of nuclear fuel elements cladding from Zircaloy). This light, strong metal makes for a great window to shoot X-rays and particles or particle streams through."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium", "passage_text": "Beryllium alloys are used in many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, high strength and hardness, nonmagnetic properties, as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance.
