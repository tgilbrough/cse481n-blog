[{"url": "http://geology.com/rocks/granite.shtml", "passage_text": "In the commercial stone industry a granite is a rock with visible grains that is harder than a marble. Under this definition gabbro, basalt, pegmatite, schist, gneiss, syenite, monzonite, anorthosite, grannodiorite, diabase, diorite and many other rocks will be called granite. It forms from the slow crystallization of magma below Earth\u2019s surface. Granite is composed mainly of quartz and feldspar with minor amounts of mica, amphiboles and other minerals. This mineral composition usually gives granite a red, pink, gray or white color with dark mineral grains visible throughout the rock."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrolith", "passage_text": "A gastrolith, also called a stomach stone or gizzard stones, is a rock held inside a gastrointestinal tract. Gastroliths in some species are retained in the muscular gizzard and used to grind food in animals lacking suitable grinding teeth. Domestic fowl require access to grit. Stones swallowed by ostriches can exceed a length of 10 centimetres (3.9 in). Amphibians such as the Axolotl are also known to deliberately ingest rocks that are presumed to be gastroliths. Apparent microgastroliths have also been found in frog tadpoles."}, {"url": "http://rocktumbler.com/polished-stones/", "passage_text": "Yellow Jasper is an opaque yellow to yellow-brown-beige chalcedony that can be polished to a very high luster.

The most common means is tumble polishing, but there is also vibratory finishing. At the end of the process the stones have a slight luster when dry. The final two steps are the polish and in some cases the burnishing. In the polishing step, rock polish is added in place of grit as well as the plastic tumbling pellets. After further tumbling the rocks should now have a shiny look when dry. If this is not the case and the rocks appear to have a film on them, a burnishing may be necessary"}, {"url": "http://rocktumbler.com/polished-stones/", "passage_text": "Obsidian is a natural volcanic glass that can be polished to a very high luster.
