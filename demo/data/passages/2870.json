Technetium does not occur naturally in the biosphere and so normally never presents a risk. All technetium compounds should be regarded as highly toxic, largely because of its radiological toxicity.

Molybdenum-99, with a half-life of 65.94 hours, decays into technetium-99 through beta decay. While technetium has never been found to occur naturally on earth, its spectral lines have been observed in S-, M-and N-type stars. Technetium's most stable isotope, technetium-98, has a half-life of about 4,200,000 years. It decays into ruthenium -98 through beta decay. Small amounts of technetium can retard the corrosion of steel, although this protection can only be applied to closed systems due to technetium's radioactivity.
