Compounds can be categorized as ionic or covalent depending on the type of bond present within the compound. Ionic compounds consist of ionic bonds that arise from the electrostatic (magnetic) attraction between ions (charged species). Part III: Naming Ionic Compounds The name of an ionic compound is simply the combination of the names of the ions. The name is written with the cation listed first followed by the name of the anion. In this section of the lab you will practice developing chemical formulas for and naming ionic"}, {"url": "http://www.chemistryexplained.com/elements/T-Z/Titanium.html", "passage_text": "Overview. Titanium is found in the middle of the periodic table. The periodic table is a chart that shows how chemical elements are related to one another.

Titanium dioxide, also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania, is the naturally occurring oxide of titanium, chemical formula TiO 2. When used as a pigment, it is called titanium white, Pigment White 6 (PW6) , or CI 77891. Generally it is sourced from ilmenite, rutile and anatase. Titanium dioxide occurs in nature as the well-known minerals rutile, anatase and brookite, and additionally as two high pressure forms, a monoclinic baddeleyite-like form and an orthorhombic \u03b1-PbO2 -like form, both found recently at the Ries crater in Bavaria. It is mainly sourced from ilmenite ore."}, {"url": "http://www.webelements.com/titanium/compounds.html", "passage_text": "Titanium: compounds information. This section lists some binary compounds with halogens (known as halides), oxygen (known as oxides), hydrogen (known as hydrides), and some other compounds of titanium. For each compound, a formal oxidation number for titanium is given, but the usefulness of this number is limited for p-block elements in particular. Based upon that oxidation number, an electronic configuration is also given but note that for more exotic compounds you should view this as a guide only.
