A hurricane can travel from a stationary position to speeds in excess of 70 mph depending on the upper level steering current winds. Most move about 15-30 mph."}, {"url": "http://www.ask.com/science/fast-hurricanes-travel-2f340bbea0f4ffa2", "passage_text": "Meteorologists classify hurricanes based on their wind speed. A hurricane with a 74 mph wind is a Category 1 hurricane. Category 2 winds are at least 96 mph. Category 3 winds are at least 111 mph. A Category 4 hurricane has wind speeds of at least 131 mph, and those of a Category 5 are at least 155 mph. The Gulf Coast and the coast of Florida have experienced numerous hurricanes that were traveling in excess of 100 mph when they struck land."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_fast_does_a_hurricane_travel", "passage_text": "Confidence votes 77.
