The binding of thesubstrate to the enzyme causes changes in the chemical bonds of the substrate and causes the reactions that lead tothe formation of products. The products are released from the enzyme surface to regenerate the enzyme for anotherreaction cycle."}, {"url": "http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistryglossary/g/Substrate-Definition.htm", "passage_text": "By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. Definition: A substrate is the medium in which a chemical reaction takes place or the reagent in a reaction that provides a surface for absorption.

In biochemistry, the substrate is a molecule upon which an enzyme acts. Enzymes catalyze chemical reactions involving the substrate(s). In the case of a single substrate, the substrate bonds with the enzyme active site, and an enzyme-substrate complex is formed. In chemistry, a substrate is typically the chemical species being observed in a chemical reaction, which reacts with reagent to generate a product. In synthetic and organic chemistry, the substrate is the chemical of interest that is being modified. In biochemistry, an enzyme substrate is the material upon which an enzyme acts.

The general equation for an enzyme reaction is: An example: Sucrase, 400 times the size of its substrate sucrose, splits the sucrose into its constituent sugars, which are glucose and fructose. 1 Enzymes increase the rate of reaction up to 10 billion-fold and are effective in tiny amounts. 2  One enzyme molecule may convert 1000 molecules of substrate a minute, and some are known to convert 3 million in a minute. 3  p39."}]
