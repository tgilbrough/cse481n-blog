Concrete reinforced with fibers (which are usually steel, glass, or plastic fibers) is less expensive than hand-tied rebar, while still increasing the tensile strength many times."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber-reinforced_concrete", "passage_text": "Fibers include steel fibers, glass fibers, synthetic fibers and natural fibers \u2013 each of which lend varying properties to the concrete. In addition, the character of fiber-reinforced concrete changes with varying concretes, fiber materials, geometries, distribution, orientation, and densities. The concept of using fibers as reinforcement is not new. Fibers have been used as reinforcement since ancient times. Historically, horsehair was used in mortar and straw in mud bricks.

Fiber reinforced concrete is a composite material comprised of Portland cement, aggregate, and fibers. Normal unreinforced concrete is brittle with a low tensile strength and strain capacity. Many types of steel fibers are used for concrete reinforcement. Round fibers are the most common type and their diameter ranges from 0.25 to 0.75 mm. Rectangular steel fibers are usually 0.25 mm thick, although 0.3 to 0.5 mm wires have been used in India."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber-reinforced_concrete", "passage_text": "Fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) is concrete containing fibrous material which increases its structural integrity.

Fiber reinforced concrete is a type of concrete that includes fibrous substances that increase its structural strength and cohesion. Fiber reinforced concrete has small distinct fibers that are homogeneously dispersed and oriented haphazardly. After the reinforcement of concrete by steel, it becomes a composite group in which the steel endures the tensile stresses. When concrete is reinforced by using fiber in the mixture, it further increases the tensile strength of the composite system."}]
