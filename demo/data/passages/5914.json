The second function of the lymphatic system is the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive system and the subsequent transport of these substances to the venous circulation. The lymphatic system includes the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and lymphatic vessels (a network of thin tubes that carry lymph and white blood cells, or leukocytes). Lymphatic vessels branch, like blood vessels, into all the tissues of the body."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_specialized_lymphatic_capillaries_of_the_intestine_that_absorb_digested_fats", "passage_text": "Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. Lacteals are the specialized lymphatic capillaries of the small intestine which transfer fats from the digetive system into the blood.

Instead of being absorbed directly into capillary blood, chylomicrons are transported first into the lymphatic vessel that penetrates into each villus. Chylomicron-rich lymph then drains into the system lymphatic system, which rapidly flows into blood. In order for the triglyceride to be absorbed, two processes must occur: 1  Large aggregates of dietary triglyceride, which are virtually insoluble in an aqueous environment, must be broken down physically and held in suspension-a process called emulsification."}, {"url": "http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/L/lymphatic_system.html", "passage_text": "There are blood capillaries and special lymph capillaries, called lacteals (see below), in the center of each villi.

In this lesson you will learn how bile salts emulsify fat so pancreatic lipase can digest it. You will also learn how fats first enter lymphatic capillaries, called lacteals, before entering your blood circulation. Chylomicrons are small globules composed of protein and lipid. The chylomicrons first enter lymphatic capillaries called lacteals before entering the general blood circulation. Fats are used to build cell membranes, make myelin sheathes, insulate the body or as an alternate fuel source."}]
