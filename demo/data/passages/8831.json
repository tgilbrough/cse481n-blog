The energy released by respiration is used to make large molecules from smaller ones. In plants, for example, sugars, nitrates and other nutrients are converted into amino acids. Amino acids can then join together to make proteins. The energy is also used: 1  To allow muscles to contract in animals."}, {"url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GCSE_Science/Breathing_and_Respiration", "passage_text": "Respiration is the process in which the chemical bonds of energy-rich molecules such as glucose are converted into energy usable for life processes.

Different organisms have different modes of respiration and respiratory systems. The basis of respiration or gas exchange is called a pressure gradient. Remember that substances tend to move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. This is also called diffusion. This is true for the two gases essential for respiration\u2014oxygen and carbon dioxide."}, {"url": "http://www.yourdictionary.com/respiration", "passage_text": "respiration. 1  act or process of respiring; breathing; inhaling and exhaling air. 2  the processes by which a living organism or cell takes in oxygen from the air or water, distributes and utilizes it in oxidation, and gives off products of oxidation, esp. carbon dioxide. 1 The process of inhaling and exhaling; breathing, breath. 2  An act of breathing; a breath. 3  Any similar process, in organisms that lack lungs, that exchanges gases with its environment. 4  The process by which cells obtain chemical energy by the consumption of oxygen and the release of"}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-respiration-definition-process-equation.html", "passage_text": "Respiration is the biochemical process in which the cells of an organism obtain energy by combining oxygen and glucose, resulting in the release of carbon dioxide, water, and ATP, the currency of energy in cells.
