It arises predominantly from right brain injury, and manifests heterogeneously in clinical deficits such as poor visual exploration to the left, inaccurate assessment of the midpoint of a line, left limb hypokinesis, and anosognosia."}, {"url": "http://www.brainline.org/content/2012/09/the-bizarre-disorder-of-hemineglect.html", "passage_text": "More than 100 years after it was first described, hemineglect\u2014also known as unilateral spatial neglect, or unilateral inattention\u2014is still one of the most fascinating and mysterious of the neuropsychological disorders.
