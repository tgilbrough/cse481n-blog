The name is from Neo-Latin molybdaenum, from Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 molybdos, meaning lead, since its ores were confused with lead ores. In its pure form, molybdenum is a silvery-grey metal with a Mohs hardness of 5.5. It has a melting point of 2,623 \u00b0C (4,753 \u00b0F); of the naturally occurring elements, only tantalum, osmium, rhenium, tungsten, and carbon have higher melting points."}, {"url": "http://www.webelements.com/molybdenum/uses.html", "passage_text": "The following uses for molybdenum are gathered from a number of sources as well as from anecdotal comments.

Molybdenum is a trace mineral found in foods such as milk, cheese, cereal grains, legumes, nuts, leafy vegetables, and organ meats. The amount in plant-derived foods depends on the soil content in the growing area. Molybdenum is also present in water in varying amounts. Children: For children, molybdenum is LIKELY SAFE in amounts that do not exceed the UL of 0.3 mg per day for children 1 to 3 years, 0.6 mg per day for children 4 to 8 years, 1.1 mg per day for children 9 to 13 years, and 1.7 mg per day for adolescents."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molybdenum", "passage_text": "Molybdenum is also used in steel alloys for its high corrosion resistance and weldability.
