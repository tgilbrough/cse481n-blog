Potassium tellurite agar is selective for the growth of Staphylococci and is somewhat selective for the growth of Corynebacteria. Staphylococci and Corynebacteria reduce the potassium tellurite in the agar, which makes the colonies grow black."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Potassium_tellurite_agar", "passage_text": "Potassium tellurite agar is selective for the growth of Staphylococci and is somewhat selective for the growth of Corynebacteria.

Principle: Lithium chloride, glycine, and potassium tellurite are the selective agents in the medium, markedly to completely inhibiting growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Potassium tellurite is the differential agent in the medium; coagulase-positive staphylococcus reduce tellurite producing black colonies."}]
