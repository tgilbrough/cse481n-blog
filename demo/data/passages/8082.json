Everyone here is giving you good advice-you'll likely receive lots of 0-3 as gifts, and the weather will change by the time you need 6+ months, so you should probably focus your shopping on the 3-6 month size. I started dressing DS in that size at 2 months. You need to figure out how often you'll do laundry (I end up doing it about every other day) and how large your baby is (what size fits) and what brand/style of stuff you like (sleepers with feet, gowns, playsuits without feet, etc). I definitely liked (and still do) the one pc. outfits and sleepers for a baby."}, {"url": "http://newbornexcitement.com/how-many-sleepers-does-a-newborn-need/", "passage_text": "Considering I usually have babies around 8 pounds (newborn sizes only usually go up to 8 pounds but most will still still fit a 9 pound baby), I only buy about 3-4 sleepers in newborn size and then will stock up on about 10 sleepers in 0-3 months.

The average newborn sleeps for up to 16 hours a day, although it may not feel like this much to you! At first your baby will need to wake up frequently for feeds, probably every three hours to four hours in the day, with longer spells at night. Find out more about how much sleep your baby needs. If possible, your baby should sleep in the same room as you (Lullaby Trust 2013) for the first six months."}, {"url": "http://newbornexcitement.com/how-many-sleepers-does-a-newborn-need/", "passage_text": "If you can\u2019t imagine trying to do laundry every other day while having a newborn then you may want to play it safe and buy at least 8-10 sleepers in each size.
