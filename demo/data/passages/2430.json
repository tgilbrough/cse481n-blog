Most employers prefer applicants who have at least a bachelor's degree and broad knowledge of, and experience with, a variety of computer systems and technologies. The usual college major for applications software engineers is computer science or software engineering. Systems software engineers often study computer science or computer information systems. Graduate degrees are preferred for some of the more complex jobs. Computer software engineers also need skills related to the industry in which they work. Engineers working for a bank, for example, should have some expertise in finance so that they understand banks' computer needs."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering", "passage_text": "Most entry-level computer engineering jobs require at least a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. Sometimes a degree in electronic engineering is accepted, due to the similarity of the two fields.

In the first two years of a bachelor\u2019s degree program, students typically finish computer engineering prerequisites and general education courses. The last two years focus on foundational classes in computer science, electrical engineering and mathematics."}, {"url": "http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/computer-hardware-engineers.htm", "passage_text": "Education. Most entry-level computer hardware engineers have a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer engineering, although a degree in electrical engineering or computer science generally is acceptable. A computer engineering major is similar to electrical engineering but with a heavy emphasis on computer science curriculum. Computer hardware engineers research, design, develop, and test computer systems and components such as processors, circuit boards, memory devices, networks, and routers. By creating new directions in computer hardware, these engineers create rapid advances in computer technology."}, {"url": "http://www.collegequest.com/how-to-become-a-software-engineer.aspx", "passage_text": "Aspiring software engineers usually major in computer science, computer information systems, software engineering or mathematics.
