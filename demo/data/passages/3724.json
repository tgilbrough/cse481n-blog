Fiberglass is a strong lightweight material and is used for many products. Although it is not as strong and stiff as composites based on carbon fiber, it is less brittle, and its raw materials are much cheaper. The glass fiber may be randomly arranged, flattened into a sheet (called a chopped strand mat), or woven into a fabric. The plastic matrix may be a thermosetting plastic \u2013 most often epoxy, polyester resin \u2013 or vinylester, or a thermoplastic."}, {"url": "http://www.compositesworld.com/zones/glass-fiber", "passage_text": "Overview The vast majority of all fibers used in the composites industry are glass.
