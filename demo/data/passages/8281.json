Raw unrefined sugar is not the same as the brown sugar that you see in the store, even though they are both brown. Unrefined raw sugar is made from the juice from the sugar cane plant and has trace minerals and nutrients present. Refined sugar is devoid of all nutrients. Like white refined sugar, brown sugar does not have the nutritional content found in unrefined. Both white refined and brown sugar are comprised of sucrose.

Unrefined brown sugar is typically referred to as 'raw sugar'. Typical brown sugar can be partially refined or can simply be refined white sugar with molasses added. By rule of thumb, the finer the grain, the more refined the product has been. Granulated sugar is sugar that comes in the form of small grains.
