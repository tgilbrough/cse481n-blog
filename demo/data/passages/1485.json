The first allele is dominant and the second allele is recessive. For genes on an autosome (any chromosome other than a sex chromosome), the alleles and their associated traits are autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. Dominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics. In Rr individuals the R allele masks the presence of the r allele, so these individuals also have round peas. Thus, allele R is dominant to allele r, and allele r is recessive to allele R. This use of upper case letters for dominant alleles and lower case ones for recessive alleles is a widely followed convention."}, {"url": "http://www.biologyexams4u.com/2012/11/autosomal-recessive-disorder.html", "passage_text": "Albinism. Albinism is characterized by the lack of dark pigment melanin in the skin, hair and iris. Caused by the absence of thyrosinase which is necessary for the synthesis of the pigment melanin from dihydroxyphenylalanine. Lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase is due to the the abnormal autosomal recessive gene on chromosome 12. In children, symptoms are mental retardation, decrease pigmentation of hair and skin and eczema. The heterozygous individuals are normal but carriers.
