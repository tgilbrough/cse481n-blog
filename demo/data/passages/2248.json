An oxide is a compound of Oxygen and another element (e.g. through the process of Combustion). \u2022 Metals form Metal Oxides and Non-Metals form Non-Metal Oxides. \u2022 Oxides can be classified as either Acidic, Basic, Amphoteric or Neutral.

Remember that metals react with oxygen in the air to produce metal oxides, like magnesium oxide. Non-metals react with oxygen in the air to produce non-metal oxides. Here are two examples for the non-metals carbon and sulphur. Carbon burns in air to form carbon dioxide: carbon + oxygen \u2192 carbon dioxide. sulphur + oxygen \u2192 sulphur dioxide. Non-metal oxides such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide are responsible for acid rain. They dissolve in the water in the clouds to form acidic solutions. Acid rain damages rocks and buildings, and harms wildlife."}, {"url": "http://mrstinechemistry.wikispaces.com/Reactions", "passage_text": "Synthesis Reactions. Synthesis reactions take place when two or more elements or simple compounds form a single compound. There are five different types of synthesis reactions: element + element, metal oxide + water, nonmetal oxide + water, metal oxide + nonmetal oxide, and metal chloride + oxygen. Synthesis Reaction. A synthesis reaction is defined as the combining of 2 or more elements/compounds to form a single compound.
