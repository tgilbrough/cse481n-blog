The accurate synthesis of proteins thus is critical to the proper functioning of cells and organisms. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) associates with a set of proteins to form ribosomes. These complex structures, which physically move along an mRNA molecule, catalyze the assembly of amino acids into protein chains. They also bind tRNAs and various accessory molecules necessary for protein synthesis."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA", "passage_text": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries information about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell.
