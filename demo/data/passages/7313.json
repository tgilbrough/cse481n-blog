It\u2019s actually a little more impressive than that. A liver can fully regenerate up to 75% of damaged tissue. And, it can do so in fairly quick order. Size can double in as little as three to four weeks through a process that is very similar to the embryonic stage of liver development. What is important, though, is that it does happen, especially considering the effects of alcohol on the liver after prolonged exposure.

Transplant surgeons, hepatologists and other researchers are developing liver cell-based regenerative therapies for patients who'd otherwise need whole-liver transplants.

With most organs, such as the heart, th \u2026 e damaged tissue is replaced with scar, like on the skin. The liver, however, is able to replace damaged tissue with new cells. An extreme example is a patient who suffers an overdose from Tylenol. In this example up to 50 - 60 percent of the liver cells may be killed within 3 - 4 days.

Within a week after partial hepatectomy, which, in typical experimental settings entails surgical removal of two-thirds of the liver, hepatic mass is back essentially to what it was prior to surgery. Partial hepatectomy leads to proliferation of all populations of cells within the liver, including hepatocytes, biliary epithelial cells and endothelial cells. DNA synthesis is initiated in these cells within 10 to 12 hours after surgery and essentially ceases in about 3 days."}]
