Besides timber wolf, they are also called common wolf, tundra wolf, Mexican wolf and plains wolf. To help with the red wolf population, wild wolves are given pups that are born in captivity. Wolves are common to all parts of the Northern Hemisphere. They are usually shy and cautious around humans but unlike the dog, have not been domesticated at all. The most common type of wolf is the gray wolf, or timber wolf. Adult grey wolves are 4 to 6.56 feet (120 to 200centimeters) long and weigh about 40 to 175 pounds (18 to 79 kilograms). Just like its name, the gray wolf typically has thick gray fur, although pure white or all black variations exist.
