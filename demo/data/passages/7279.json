A carboxylic acid contains the-COOH group, and in an ester the hydrogen in this group is replaced by a hydrocarbon group of some kind.

Esters are common in organic chemistry and biological materials, and often have a characteristic pleasant, fruity odor. Esters are widespread in nature and are widely used in industry. In nature, fats are, in general, triesters derived from glycerol and fatty acids.

This is due to the fact that esters are more soluble when in contact with the plant\u2019s waxy cuticle. Plants are more likely to quickly absorb esters, as amines are more water soluble. As we all know, correct timing is crucial for acceptable weed control. This also comes into play when deciding what formulation to use; ester or amine. During cooler weather (March, April, and early May), ester formulations can be used safely, and typically provide better weed control than amines."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxylic_acid", "passage_text": "Carboxylic acids also react with alcohols to give esters.
