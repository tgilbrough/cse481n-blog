With a typical daytime electric tarriff of 15p per kWh (kilowatt hour), it costs 45p per hour to heat your hot water with an immersion. Heating with gas will be significantly cheaper. Gas is currently 5p per kWh and assuming you have an old inefficient boiler running at 80% efficiency, it will be costing you 7p per kWh. Assuming you are paying 15p per kwh this equates to 15p per day or \u00a354 per year.

Best Answer: The heater is rated at 3Kilowatts. If left on for 1 hour you will use 3 Kw of power. The cost is around 16 pence per Kw so the cost in this case will be 48 pence. If left for a 2nd hour the thermostat will cut of the power when the water is at the preset temperature so the cost will be less.

Divide the watts by 1000, times the hours per day it will run, times .09 cents. That will be close to the daily cost.
