Nitrogen dioxide, NO 2 reacts with water to give nitric and nitrous acids (Ostwald process). It is a disproportionation reaction. The Nitrogen in NO 2 is in +4 oxidation state. It is reduced to nitrous acid, HNO 2 in which the OS of nitrogen is +3 and oxidized to nitric acid, HNO 3 in which the OS of nitrogen is +5. Except fluorine, halogens (Cl 2 ,Br 2, I 2) undergo disproportionation in alkaline medium. They form halide and hypohalite in cold and dilute alkali.
