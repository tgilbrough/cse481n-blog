Any excess credit is not usable. For example, if you claim a $1,050 maximum credit for the care of one child and owe $750, the IRS will use your credit to wipe out your tax bill, but you won't get the extra $300 as a refund. You can claim only up to $3,000 for the care of one person and $6,000 for two or more. Then this amount is further reduced based on your overall income (more on this later). There is some good news, however."}, {"url": "http://www.justanswer.com/tax/03q3n-maximum-amount-claim-daycare.html", "passage_text": "This credit is available for household and child-care expenses incurred to enable you (and your spouse) to be gainfully employed.
