Summary: Flagellar and translocation-associated type III secretion (T3S) systems are present in most Gram-negative plant-and animal-pathogenic bacteria and are often essential for bacterial motility or pathogenicity. To date, T3S4 proteins have been described for translocation-associated T3S systems from several animal-pathogenic bacteria (YscP from Yersinia spp., Spa32 from Shigella spp., and InvJ from Salmonella spp.) and the plant-pathogenic bacterium X. campestris pv. vesicatoria (HpaC) (Table 6)."}, {"url": "http://mmbr.asm.org/content/76/2/262.full", "passage_text": "Different translocation-associated T3S systems have also been identified in the animal-pathogenic bacteria Yersinia spp. and Burkholderia spp. Interestingly, Burkholderia spp. contain not only a SPI-1 T3S system but also Hrp-type T3S systems that are usually specific for plant-pathogenic bacteria (449, 522) (Fig. 1D).

The type III secretion (T3S) pathway allows bacteria to inject effector proteins into the cytosol of target animal or plant cells. T3S systems evolved into seven families that were distributed among Gram-negative bacteria by horizontal gene transfer. All of the T3S systems from plant pathogens can be grouped into two families on the basis of the genetic loci organization and regulatory systems (1, 2). This subdivision also appears in the phylogenetic trees (48, 56, 96). In both families, the injectisome has a long, flexible pilus instead of a needle."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion", "passage_text": "Secretion in bacterial species means the transport or translocation of effector molecules for example: proteins, enzymes or toxins (such as cholera toxin in pathogenic bacteria for example Vibrio cholerae) from across the interior (cytoplasm or cytosol) of a bacterial cell to its exterior.
