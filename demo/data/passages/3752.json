The range rule tells us that the standard deviation of a sample is approximately equal to one fourth of the range of the data. In other words s = (Maximum \u2013 Minimum)/4. This is a very straightforward formula to use, and should only be used as a very rough estimate of the standard deviation."}, {"url": "http://statistics.about.com/od/Descriptive-Statistics/a/Range-Rule-For-Standard-Deviation.htm", "passage_text": "These values have mean of 17 and standard deviation of about 4.1. If instead we first calculate the range of our data as 25 \u2013 12 = 13, and then divide this number by four we have our estimate of the standard deviation as 13/4 = 3.25. This number is relatively close to the true standard deviation, and good for a rough estimate."}]
