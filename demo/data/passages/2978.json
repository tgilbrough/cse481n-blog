So if a perso \u2026 n has Ao for their genes, they will have A type blood. A recessive gene will be hidden unless there are two of the same recessive gene.

Something like nearsightedness is probably made up of more than one disease and each disease probably has more than one gene involved! Poor eyesight definitely runs in families."}, {"url": "http://www.indiacurry.com/women/dominantrecessive.htm", "passage_text": "Normally, there are two types of genes for each trait: Dominant, and Recessive. Dominant genes when paired with recessive gene determines the trait to be expressed. Recessive gene is not expressed when paired with dominant gene. Recessive genes are only expressed when paired with another recessive gene. Twenty two pair of Chromosomes look alike and are called autosomes. The twenty-third pair is different, two X-chromosomes for female, one X-and one Y-chromosome for a male."}]
