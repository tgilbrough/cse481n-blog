The last step of glycolysis produces two pyruvate molecules in the cytosol, which are then brought to the mitochondrial matrix via active transport. There are eight steps to the citric acid cycle. 1) The acetyl group from Acetyl-CoA is transferred to the acceptor molecule, oxaloacetate. Coenzyme A can then return to pyruvate oxidation. The resulting molecule is citrate."}, {"url": "http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Acetyl-coa", "passage_text": "Acetyl-coa.

Before entering the Krebs cycle, the three-carbon pyruvate is oxidized to a two-carbon acetate molecule and carbon dioxide, producing one molecule of NADH. The acetate joins to a molecule of coenzyme A to form acetyl coenzyme A, which carries the acetyl group to the Krebs cycle. The acetate enters the cycle by combining with OAA (oxaloacetic acid) to form citric acid. As the reactions of the Krebs cycle continue, the two acetyl carbons are successively oxidized to carbon dioxide, forming two molecules of NADH and one of FADH 2, which will provide electrons to the electron transport chain to form ATP."}]
