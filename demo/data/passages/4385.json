Before going to see the examples of opportunistic infection, it would be better to learn that what is HIV and how it helps such infections to attack on the immune system.

These are infections that take advantage of weakness in the immune system. OIs also include certain types of cancer. Some OIs only affect women or affect women more than men. For example, certain female health problems, like yeast infections, are common to many women. For women with HIV, these problems are harder to treat and can be more serious. If you have HIV and develop one or more OIs, you might have AIDS. The good news is that there are ways to prevent and treat many OIs."}, {"url": "http://hivsymptomsonline.com/two-examples-of-opprtunistic-infection.html", "passage_text": "Examples of opportunistic infections are given here for your sake.
