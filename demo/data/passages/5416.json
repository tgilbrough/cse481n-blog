Because geographers today often study a wide variety of topics, it is helpful to break the world down into regions to make information easier to process and display.

Permeable and impermeable layers of rock in the Malham area give rise to intermittent drainage. We see features formed both at the surface and underground. Surface water passes over impermeable rock until it reaches permeable limestone. The water passes through the limestone and erodes it to form swallow holes. Gaping Gill is a swallow hole where water has eroded a cave to form the highest waterfall in Britain. The water continues to flow underground until the limestone meets impermeable rock at the valley floor. Here there is a resurgence where the water returns to the surface. Shake holes and water sinks are also formed by the flow of surface water"}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/rock_landscapes/rock_types_rev2.shtml", "passage_text": "1 One of the largest areas of limestone [limestone: A sedimentary rock consisting mainly of calcium carbonate. 2  It is commonly used as a building stone. ] 3  in the UK is found in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, near Malham and Ingleton. 4  Limestone is a sedimentary rock made of calcium carbonate. 1 It is commonly used as a building stone. ] 2  in the UK is found in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, near Malham and Ingleton. 3"}, {"url": "http://geographyfieldtrips.com/listing-type/resurgence/", "passage_text": "Malham Cove.
