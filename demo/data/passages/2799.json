Some strains are able to double in size in 24 hours, and can carry 40-70 percent of their mass as oil. There are many different methods. In one technique, massive quantities of algae are grown and then harvested.

Plastics are essential in modern industry, but their downsides are hard to ignore. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 32 million tons of plastic were discarded in 2012. This waste ends up in landfills and waterways, where it is expected to stay for a very long time.

First, algae is not used as a primary food source for humans, meaning that it can be used solely for fuel and there would be little impact in the food industry. Second, many of the waste-product extracts produced during the processing of algae for biofuel can be used as a sufficient animal feed."}, {"url": "http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a5705/algae-to-plastic/", "passage_text": "It takes roughly a pound and a half of dried, pressed algae to make a pound of the algal portion of the plastic, he says.
