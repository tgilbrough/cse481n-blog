Like an electron in an inner shell, a valence electron has the ability to absorb or release energy in the form of a photon. An energy gain can trigger an electron to move (jump) to an outer shell; this is known as atomic excitation."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSEPR_theory", "passage_text": "The number of electron pairs in the valence shell of a central atom is determined after drawing the Lewis structure of the molecule, and expanding it to show all bonding groups and lone pairs of electrons. The premise of VSEPR is that the valence electron pairs surrounding an atom tend to repel each other, and will therefore adopt an arrangement that minimizes this repulsion, thus determining the molecule's geometry."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_affinity", "passage_text": "E ea generally increases across a period (row) in the periodic table. This is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a Group 17 atom releases more energy than a Group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and therefore is more stable.
