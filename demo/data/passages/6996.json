Like the crystal on your watch, your cornea serves as a protective window that allows light to enter your eye and come to focus on your retina. The cornea must remain clear for you to have good vision.

The cornea shares this protective task with the eyelids, the eye socket, tears, and the sclera, or white part of the eye. The cornea acts as the eye's outermost lens. It functions like a window that controls and focuses the entry of light into the eye. When light strikes the cornea, it bends -- or refracts -- the incoming light onto the lens. The lens further refocuses that light onto the retina, a layer of light sensing cells lining the back of the eye that starts the translation of light into vision."}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/cornea", "passage_text": "The cornea is the transparent part of the eye that covers the front portion of the eye.

The cornea contributes more to the total refraction than the lens does, but, whereas the curvature of the lens can be adjusted to tune the focus, the curvature of the cornea is fixed.

The cornea is the transparent front part of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber.

In humans, the refractive power of the cornea is approximately 43 dioptres.

A circular muscle in the iris controls the amount of light entering the eye through the pupil, the black area in the center of the iris. The cornea is the outer clear, round structure that covers the iris and the pupil. The cornea directs light rays into the eye and helps focus them on the light-sensitive retina at the back of the eye, providing sharp, clear vision.
