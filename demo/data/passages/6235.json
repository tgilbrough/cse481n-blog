After studying the movie GATTACA, it is clear that eugenics plays a vital role in the storyline. Although the movie was created in 1997 and was set in the \u2018not too distant future\u2019, it is evident that what was fictional is partially becoming reality. The further enhancement of eugenics is becoming rapid, and profound. Many people have a negative attitude towards eugenics after inspecting GATTACA; the cons of eugenics have been demonstrated flawlessly in the movie. But what GATTACA fails to do is cover in depth the pros of this new and advanced technology we possess."}, {"url": "http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/essays/gattaca.htm", "passage_text": "Genetic engineering represents our fondest hopes and aspirations as well as our darkest fears and misgivings. That\u2019s why most discussions of the new technology are likely to be so heated. The technology touches the core of our self-definition. In their book The DNA Mystique, Nelkin and Lindee have found that the creators of popular culture act as another ally for genetic determinism, arguing that the rising public acceptance of this ideology has translated into a cult of the gene increasingly visible in popular-culture narratives (3)."}, {"url": "http://www.philfilms.utm.edu/1/gattaca.htm", "passage_text": "Philosophically, however, it is rather tempting to toss Gattaca out the window. The philosophical content it does offer is quite accessible, and rather than being incidental to the plot, it is actually the focus of the film. Its take on human determinism, though, can only go so far. Gattaca: This movie was eye opening in the sense that society felt like they had to label social classes based on the genetic make up of a human being.

NOTES 1. GATTACA, directed by Andrew Niccol, 1997, Columbia Tristar Pictures. The title of the film is actually an acronym of sorts. Given the rejection of familial associations in favor of genetic associations, it is not surprising that other cultural relationships break down in GATTACA\u2019s genetic determinist society.
