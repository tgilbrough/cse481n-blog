It is known as rayon fibre in the USA. Although several cellulosic fibres had been made experimentally during the 19th century, it was not until 1905 that what has become the most popular cellulosic fibre, viscose, was produced."}, {"url": "http://www.whatisviscose.com/Viscose.html", "passage_text": "The World of.

Viscose is very similar to cotton and silk. (Cotton is also made of cellulose).

Mostly cellulose from wood is used to produce the fibres but sometimes cellulose from short cotton fibres, called linters, is the source. By far the most common cellulosic fibre is viscose fibre."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscose", "passage_text": "Rayon fiber is produced from the ripened viscose solutions by treatment with a mineral acid, such as sulfuric acid. Viscose rayon is a fiber of regenerated cellulose; it is structurally similar to cotton but may be produced from a variety of plants such as soy, bamboo, and sugar cane. Cellulose is a linear polymer of \u03b2-D-glucose units with the empirical formula (C 6 H 10 O 5) n."}]
