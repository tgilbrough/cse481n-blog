It's based on the theory that energy, called chi (say chee), flows through and around your body along pathways called meridians. Acupuncturists believe that illness occurs when something blocks or unbalances your chi. Acupuncture is a way to unblock or influence chi and help it flow back into balance. Acupuncture is done by putting very thin needles into your skin at certain points on your body. This is done to influence the energy flow."}, {"url": "http://acupuncturist.edu/academy-clinic/what-is-acupuncture/", "passage_text": "The practice of acupuncture is based on understanding the flow of qi, or vital energy in nature and in ourselves.

When our qi is obstructed or imbalanced, illness and pain can occur. The symptoms we experience are signals that we need to take measures to restore balance."}, {"url": "http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/treatment/acupuncture", "passage_text": "Acupuncture is a treatment based on Chinese medicine -- a system of healing that dates back thousands of years.
