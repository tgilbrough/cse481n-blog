The protostome coelom forms from a split within the mesoderm tissue, so they are sometimes refereed to as schizocoels. Bivalves form a pair of siphons, sometimes formed by folds of the mantle, which let water in (incurrent siphon) or let water out (excurrent siphon). The flow of water is caused by the beating of the cilia that cover the gills.

A major difference between them is that annelids are segmented and have a closed circulatory system whereas molluscs are not segmented and have an open circulatory system. Phylum: Mollusca - [soft body] snails, bivalves, squid and octopi. Molluscs are a diverse group with over 50,000 described species. Annelids are characterized by having elongate, conspicuously segmented body.
