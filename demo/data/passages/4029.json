This protein gives the fibers a red color and therefore these fibers are also called red muscle fibers. Attached to the bone and moves them by contraction. The contraction is initiated by neural impulses and is under voluntary control. Structure. A muscle consists of a number of muscle fibers bound together by connective tissue and it is attached to a bone by collagen bundles called tendons. A single muscle fiber is a multinucleated cell and is formed from myoblasts during development"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoglobin", "passage_text": "Myoglobin is found in Type I muscle, Type II A and Type II B, but most texts consider myoglobin not to be found in smooth muscle. Myoglobin was the first protein to have its three-dimensional structure revealed by X-ray crystallography. For one the protein has only one binding site for oxygen on the one heme group on the protein. While myoglobin can only hold one oxygen, the affinity for that oxygen is very high compared to hemoglobin."}, {"url": "http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/hemoglobin/hemoglobh.htm", "passage_text": "However oxygen is not very soluble in water, and so in order for animals to convey oxygen from the lungs (or gills) to the muscles they needed to evolve an efficient oxygen-carrying molecule. In vertebrates, these molecules are the proteins myoglobin and hemoglobin. Red blood cells (above) contain hemoglobin. Blood is bright red (left), due the presence of oxy-hemoglobin. Hemoglobin (or haemoglobin, frequently abbreviated as Hb), which is contained in red blood cells, serves as the oxygen carrier in blood. "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoglobin", "passage_text": "Myoglobin is an iron-and oxygen-binding protein found in the muscle tissue of vertebrates in general and in almost all mammals. It is related to hemoglobin, which is the iron-and oxygen-binding protein in blood, specifically in the red blood cells. In humans, myoglobin is only found in the bloodstream after muscle injury. It is an abnormal finding, and can be diagnostically relevant when found in blood. For one the protein has only one binding site for oxygen on the one heme group on the protein.

These contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein, which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood. When it reaches the lungs, gas exchange occurs when carbon dioxide is diffused out of the blood into the pulmonary alveoli and oxygen is diffused into the blood. This oxygenated blood is pumped to the left hand side of the heart in the pulmonary vein and enters the left atrium."}]
