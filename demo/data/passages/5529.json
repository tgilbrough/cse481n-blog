I really thought it was around the 1870s the whole way through the movie until I looked back at Hans' outfit, because of what Anna and Elsa wear, but I'm just completely guessing. You have a good point on what Hans wears, but then again, just look at Elsa&#x27;s outfit... Maybe present time, idk I just don&#x27;t think Disney was really trying to put t in a time period.

I am sometimes asked to describe the frozen period and the benefits and costs to setting it at certain durations. At some companies setting a real frozen period can be a challenge and often times they want to know why should use any frozen period at all.

These are the time periods when huge poofy sleeves would have been in fashion. The late 1600's was The Golden Age of piracy and of sailing in general. The late 1800's/early 1900's was another important age in sailing."}, {"url": "http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:307915", "passage_text": "Tangled is set in the 1780s according to the Mother Gothel page.

One reason why all of Shakespeare's plays are so successful 400 years after his death is that they can be set in almost any time period and almost any place. Confidence votes 38. Although Romeo and Juliet was written between 1591-1596, the play could have been set at any time from 1300 to 1600. An argument can be made that it takes place around the late 1400's. Italy was then in a time of unrest, as is showcased in the drama."}]
