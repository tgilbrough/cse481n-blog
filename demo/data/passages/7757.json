The adult average is lower than 37\u00b0 C, and skin temperature can vary from around 32\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 C (90\u00b0 to 95\u00b0 F), and will be cold \u2026 er when losing heat to the environment. The body temperatures of mammals range from around 97\u00b0 to over 103\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Birds have average temperatures of around 105\u00b0 Fahrenheit. The phi point between the freezing temperature (32\u00b0 F) and the boiling temperature (212\u00b0 F) of water is 100.8\u00b0 F, or 38.2\u00b0 Centigrade."}, {"url": "http://www.cmlsupport.org.uk/section/normal-blood-counts", "passage_text": "The normal range of the percentage of neutrophils is between 45% and 70%.

Reference ranges and unit measurements can vary per lab. And what is normal can also vary per person and race. If your lab results are outside the normal range, we suggest that you discuss with your doctor. Often it is not the result, but the change from a previous test that is most instructive. For best comparisons of lab results, the tests should be done in the same lab. Range 11.0 - 15.0. Measures the range of sizes of red blood cells in a blood sample.

Basophil granulocytes, mostly referred to as basophils, are the least common of the granulocytes, representing about 0.01% to 0.3% of circulating white blood cells. Standard Range is 0.0 - 2.0 % via differential blood count. Basopenia (a low basophil count) is difficult to demonstrate as the normal basophil count is so low; it has been reported in association with autoimmune urticaria (a chronic itching condition). Basophilia is also uncommon but may be seen in some forms of leukaemia or lymphoma."}]
