Notes: Although the rationale for polyphase electrical power may not be apparent from either the question or the given answer, your students need to be aware of its existence. Polyphase AC voltages are usually created by special alternators, with different \u201cphase\u201d windings spaced around the circumference of the stator.

Whereas a synchronous motor's rotor turns at the same rate as the stator field, an induction motor's rotor rotates at a slower speed than the stator field.
