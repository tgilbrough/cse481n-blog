Non-vascular plants are the simplest of all land dwelling plants. Their closest ancestor is the green algae, and like the green algae, they lack an internal means for transporting water. Also, non-vascular plants do not produce seeds or flowers. In terms of physical appearance, non-vascular plants typically only reach a height of one or two centimeters due to their lack of the woody tissue necessary for support on land. In addition, they are almost always found in damp, shady places.
