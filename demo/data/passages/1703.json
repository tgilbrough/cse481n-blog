Eluxadoline belongs to a group of drugs called mu-opioid receptor antaognists. The exact mechanism of eluxadoline in IBS-D is not known, but eluxadoline interacts with opioid receptors in the gut. This medication comes in tablet form and is taken 2 times a day with food. It is not known if eluxadoline crosses into human milk.
