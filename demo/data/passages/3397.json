There are two types of lymphocytes of the acquired immune system: T cells and B cells. There is a third type of lymphocyte known as natural killer (NK) cells, but these are a part of the innate immune system. Anything that the immune system can detect and attack is called an antigen. The activation of the acquired immune system initially requires the help of other cells. The cells of the acquired immune system are coated in receptors. These are highly specific molecules designed to recognise certain substances."}, {"url": "http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Definition-of-MS", "passage_text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) involves an immune-mediated process in which an abnormal response of the body\u2019s immune system is directed against the central nervous system (CNS), which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.

To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. Hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body's own tissues. They are divided into four classes (Type I \u2013 IV) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy."}, {"url": "http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/immune-disorders/biology-of-the-immune-system/innate-immunity", "passage_text": "Cytokines.

Although immune responses can occur anywhere in the body these cells are found, they primarily occur in the lymph nodes and spleen. Although all immune responses are similar, each time the body is invaded by a different antigen, the exact response is specific to that antigen.

The body does not usually start an immune response against its own antigens because cells that recognize self-antigens are deleted or inactivated.

Antibodies (also known as immunoglobulin, Ig), are large Y-shaped proteins used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects. Sometimes the adaptive system is unable to distinguish foreign molecules, the effects of this may be hayfever, asthma or any other allergies. Antigens are any substances that elicit the adaptive immune response. The cells that carry out the adaptive immune response are white blood cells known as lymphocytes."}]
