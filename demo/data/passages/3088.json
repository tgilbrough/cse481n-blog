Surgery to remove a pituitary microadenoma is a common course of treatment. Serious adrenal gland problems can occur with ATCH and TSH-producing tumors. A pituitary microadenoma is a very small, noncancerous tumor that forms in the pituitary gland. It is medically defined as a mass that is less than about 1 centimeter (10 millimeters) in diameter that grows slowly and does not carry any risk of metastasizing, or spreading, to other parts of the brain or body. As the pituitary gland is technically not part of the brain, pituitary tumors are not considered brain tumors. Some pituitary tumors are visible on MRI scans. Located in the head, the pea-sized pituitary gland produces hormones and regulates several other glands of the body's endocrine system."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma", "passage_text": "Adenoma is a benign tumor of glandular tissue, such as the mucosa of stomach, small intestine, and colon, in which tumor cells form glands or gland like structures.
