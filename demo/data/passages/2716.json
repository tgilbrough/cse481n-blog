To move or excavate dirt to build or dig a pond, you can expect to pay roughly $2.50 per cubic yard of material dug out of the pond. Figure $1.50 - 3.50 per yard of material depending on the difficulty of excavation and costs specific to local market conditions. A pond is very much more than a hole in the ground that collects water. After calculating a rough pond excavation budget, now double the pond construction budget due to the cost of dredging and re-digging the pond in ten to twenty years or sooner due to a poor pond design."}, {"url": "http://www.gardenmyths.com/pond-pumps-filters/", "passage_text": "But this is not usually a problem in a man-made garden pond. If your pond water is green with algae it is probably healthy. You might not like the look \u2013 that is a different matter. In Japan, garden ponds are treasured and it is common to buy a dye to color the pond water. The use of the word \u2018natural\u2019 here refers to the pond filtration system, not the esthetic look of the pond. I\u2019ll deal with esthetics in a future post on how to build ponds. In a natural pond the water, soil, plants, and animals all live in harmony. No one comes along to clean the pond or to aerate it."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/how_8697374_make-manmade-pond.html", "passage_text": "Measure the pond outline to determine how much liner you will need. To do this, determine how deep you want your pond to be and double this number: for example, double a 4-foot pond to 8 feet. Then add the width and the amount of the doubled depth, plus 2 feet for overlap, and do the same for the height. The resulting numbers will be the size liner you need. Remove the grass from the pond area using a flat shovel, going about 6 inches outside of the perimeter you drew. Dig out the pond, going approximately 2 inches below the depth you need for your pond to make room for settlement. Remove any roots or sharp stones from the hole, as these can damage your liner."}, {"url": "http://www.livingthecountrylife.com/homes-acreages/ponds/understand-how-to-maintain-your-ponds-ecosystem/", "passage_text": "Wildlife is a large part of the pleasure of a pond. A large body of still water attracts quail, rabbits, raccoons, turtles, songbirds, ducks, and deer. You can increase wildlife populations by providing plenty of cover in the form of grasses, trees, and shrubs, especially those that bear small fruits. Create an underwater shelter. As long as you fish regularly in your pond, You can get a pretty good idea of the health and fish population, says Stratford Kay, aquatic specialist at North Carolina State University. To help fish breed and survive, create an underwater shelter in your pond."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pond", "passage_text": "Researchers for the British charity Pond Conservation have defined a pond to be 'a man-made or natural waterbody which is between 1 m 2 and 20,000 m 2 in area (2 ha or ~5 acres), which holds water for four months of the year or more.' Other European biologists have set the upper size limit at 5 ha (12 acres).

The key, says Norland, is to decide what you want out of a pond and how to get it.
