Making the world better, one answer at a time. Transport proteins are important because they carry proteins which move molecules from one place to another around the body. A protein channel is a transport protein that helps larger molecules, that would otherwise not be able to defuse throw the membrane of a cell, to move in or out of the cell de \u2026 pending on the concentration gradient. + 21 others found this useful."}, {"url": "http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/transport-proteins-in-the-cell-membrane-14704938", "passage_text": "Delete Content.

Cells which carry out a lot of active transport often have lots of mitochondria to give them the energy they need. Active transport is important in the kidney for hanging on to the substances needed by the body such as glucose and some sodium ions. Substances are moving in and out of the cells of your body all the time. To understand why the water balance is so important in homeostasis, and to make sense of how your kidneys work, you need to know about diffusion, osmosis and active transport."}]
