That includes the cost of the pump, pressure tank, piping to house, wiring to and from house, all labor, and well test/water test. So the per foot cost of drilling is probably closer to $20. A minimum acceptable flow rate for a family   of 4 would be about 3 gallon \u2026 s per minute into the well.     A good (good flow rate, we aren't taking about   the quality of the water here, just the volume) well   would produce 5 or more gallons per minute."}, {"url": "http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/solar_hot_water/pools/q_and_a/index.htm", "passage_text": "Average yearly cost for heating a residential pool in Florida is $1,450 using electrical resistance (electricity at $0.09/kWh), $500 using an electric heat pump and $580 using natural gas.
