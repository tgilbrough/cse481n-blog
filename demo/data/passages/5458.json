The average cost to build a residential tennis court from start to finish including dirt work, post tension slab, fencing, lighting, surfacing and accessories, is about $65,000.

Multiply by four hours and you get $4.80 for the night, times 180 nights a year is $864 in electricity costs to light one court. For seven years, then, electricity cost is $6,048. As mentioned earlier, plan on $900 per court for MH maintenance. (Individual bulbs may burn out sooner, but this is a reasonable average vendor cost to maintain appropriate light levels.) Over a seven-year period, you should replace all eight bulbs twice near the beginning and end of this period, or $1,800. Let\u2019s start with the hard costs of MH. We have to make some assumptions, but this analysis will give you a point of comparison between an MH court and its most likely successor, LED technology. Let\u2019s assume a typical tennis court with eight 1,000-watt MH fixtures, or 8,000 total watts. That\u2019s like eight hair dryers going full blast. A busy outdoor facility might run them an average of four hours a night (an indoor club obviously much more) and 180 nights a year (some climates more, some less)"}, {"url": "http://www.fast-dry.com/faq.php", "passage_text": "We generally build your new tennis court on a properly prepared sub-base.
