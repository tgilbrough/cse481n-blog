The American Ferret Association recommends feeding ferrets a cat food that's low in carbohydrates and no more than 20 percent fat. The content should be, at minimum, 36 percent protein. Commercial ferret foods generally are 30 percent to 40 percent animal protein and 15 percent to 20 percent fat, with no grains. Ideally, pet ferrets should eat commercial ferret food, if not a whole-prey diet. If manufactured ferret chow isn't available or if you run out, and a whole-prey diet is too gross for your comfort, feeding cat food is safe and acceptable. Ferrets and felines are both obligate carnivores -- they must eat meat. Feed ferrets a high-quality cat food with no grains or vegetables, one designed for adults or kittens.

They cannot survive without meat in their diet. However, although fresh raw meat is part of the ferret's natural diet, it may contain harmful parasites and micro-organisms that create risks unacceptable to pet owners. Generic cat foods, sold in grocery and farm supply stores, are NOT good for ferrets. Generic cat foods cost much less than premium foods, but they have some important nutritional deficiencies, and are too low in fat. The ferret has to eat at least twice as much of the cheaper food to get the calories he needs."}]
