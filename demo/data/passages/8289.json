Burial insurance covers the cost of your funeral or cremation once you pass. Many people do not realize that funerals can cost several thousand dollars when all the expenses are added up, and they therefore do not plan to save and leave funds for their family or loved ones to help cover the costs."}, {"url": "http://www.wilbert.com/burial/", "passage_text": "A burial vault is a lined and sealed outer receptacle that houses the casket.
