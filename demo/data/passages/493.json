The duodenum can be identified by Brunner's glands. The jejunum has neither Brunner's glands nor Peyer's patches. At least 46% of Peyer's patches are concentrated in the distal 25 cm of ileum in humans.

Click to read more below. Peyer\u2019s patches are small masses of lymphatic tissue found throughout the ileum region of the small intestine. Also known as aggregated lymphoid nodules, they form an important part of the immune system by monitoring intestinal bacteria populations and preventing the growth of pathogenic bacteria in the intestines.

Special epithelial cells known as microfold cells line the side of the Peyer\u2019s patch facing the intestinal lumen, while the outer side contains many lymphoid cells and lymphatic vessels.
