On one Florida project, asphalt was shown to be twice the cost of a concrete lot over 20 years. Concrete parking lots make sense for many applications. Wisconsin Ready Mixed Concrete Association. Comparing the initial cost and the cost over a 20-year life cycle, concrete is considerably less expensive.
