Its membrane typically constitutes more than half of the total membrane of an average animal cell (see Table 12-2). The ER is organized into a netlike labyrinth of branching tubules and flattened sacs extending throughout the cytosol (Figure 12-35)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum", "passage_text": "The general structure of the endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes called cisternae. These sac-like structures are held together by the cytoskeleton.
