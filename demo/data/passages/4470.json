Howdy I need to replace 2 of the tyres on my '99 model A6 2.4 front wheel drive. I currently have 4 Michelins of which 2 have to be replaced. I have gotten qoutes for Pirelli at R885 per tyre fully fitted and Continental for 878 fully fitted, size 205 55 16. What would you guys recommend? I plan to on Saturday replace 2 of the Michelins, move the 2 that have some tread left to the rear and put 2 new tyres in front"}, {"url": "http://www.wheels.ca/news/tire-comparison-continental-truecontact-vs-bridgestone-ecopia/", "passage_text": "One of the best rain tires available at Canadian Tire is the Pirelli P7 All Season Plus, at $207. Other excellent rain tires include the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3, at $206, and the Continental ProContact, at $266. Enter the new Continental TrueContact, which Canadian Tire recently pitted against a Bridgestone Ecopia 422 for head-to-head testing in wet braking, ride comfort and a dry high-speed slalom course. My concern with the Bridgestone Ecopia as a test rival is that it is an apple to orange comparison."}, {"url": "http://www.moderntiredealer.com/blogpost/b-o-b/340514/the-usual-suspect-is-the-no-1-tire-says-consumer-reports", "passage_text": "The Continental and Pirelli brands also were at or near the top of many of the lists.

My tire supplier is offerring me a choice between Pirelli and Continental. Of course, he has other tires, but he feels he can get me the best value on one of these two brands. I'm not at all familiar with the Continental tires. Pirelli has great size selection, but other than that I'd rather have the cheaper, longer lasting Continental CS2's. Unfortunately I believe there is a national backorder on the CS2's as I recently tried to purchase them for my new wheels coming in."}, {"url": "http://articles.courant.com/2012-09-29/business/hc-ls-consumer-reports-tire-ratings-20120929_1_performance-all-season-tires-winter-tires-michelin-primacy-mxv4", "passage_text": "It was followed closely by the Continental ProContact EcoPlus.
