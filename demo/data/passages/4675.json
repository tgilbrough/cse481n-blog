Most marine life needs calcium carbonate to make shells and bones. Since sodium carbonate isn't so vital I suppose it qualifies as more harmful. (Don't confuse it with the rather harmless sodium hydrogen carbonate or sodium bicarbonate.) I think using washing soda (sodium carbonate) in the house is not a big environmental issue because it is harmless when dissolved. Neutralization of sodium carbonate with hydrochloric acid will produce sodium chloride."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Is_calcium_carbonate_harmful", "passage_text": "Calcium is essential to the body, but in higher recommended quantities can be harmful.
