Opioids have similar properties to the opium from which they are derived. One of the main functions of opioids is to produce sedation and pain relief and they have been used for pain relief over thousands of years. Opioids are essentially chemicals that bind to opioids receptors present in the brain and central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract to stimulate their effects.

In a medical context the term usually indicates medications that are artificially made rather than extracted from opium. The term opioid was first used in the early 1960s.

Opioid's can be classified as natrual, semi-synthetic, and fully-synthetic. Natural opioid's include morphine, codeine, thebaine, and oripavine. Semi-sythetic opioids include hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and heroin. Fully-synthetic opioids include fentanyl, pethidine, methadone, and propoxyphene. Opioid's bind to specific opioid receptors in the central nervous system and in other tissues. Opioids work in the body by attaching to the opioid receptors. These receptors are found in the gastrointestinal tract, along the spinal cord and in the brain. The body stops perceiving pain when these receptors are blocked. Another effect of opioids is the feeling of euphoria that is often associated with them."}]
