The nucleotide in DNA consists of a sugar (deoxyribose), one of four bases (cytosine (C), thymine (T), adenine (A), guanine (G)), and a phosphate. Cytosine and thymine are pyrimidine bases, while adenine and guanine are purine bases. The sugar and the base together are called a nucleoside."}, {"url": "http://dna-in-a-human-cell.wikispaces.com/", "passage_text": "1 Average number of nucleotide pairs in a single human DNA molecule: 1.5 x 10^8. 2  Estimated total number of nucleotide pairs in a human cell: 6 x 10^9. 3  The average size of a human cell is 10 micrometers. 4  The average size of the nucleus in a human cell is 5"}, {"url": "http://scienceprimer.com/nucleotides-rna", "passage_text": "RNA nucleotides differ from DNA nucleotides by the presence of a hydroxyl group linked to the #2 carbon of the sugar.
