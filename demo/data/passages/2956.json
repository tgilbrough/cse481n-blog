Bacteria are members of the prokaryote group. In contrast to eukaryote cells, bacteria lack a cell nucleus and customarily have no organelles.

They are prokaryotic microorganisms. Bacterial cells do not have a nucleus, and most have no organelles with membranes round them. Most have a cell wall. They do have DNA, and their biochemistry is basically the same as other living things. Most bacteria live in the ground or in water, but many live inside or on the skin of other organisms, including humans.

A lot of these bacterial cells are found lining the digestive system. When conditions are favourable such as the right temperature and nutrients are available, some bacteria like Escherichia coli can divide every 20 minutes.

They can live within soil, in the ocean and inside the human gut. Humans' relationship with bacteria is complex. Sometimes they lend a helping hand, by curdling milk into yogurt, or helping with our digestion. However, certain bacteria, like the mycoplasmas do not have a cell wall at all. Some bacteria may even have a third, outermost, protective layer called the capsule. Lastly, bacterial surfaces can be covered by whip-like extensions: flagella or pili."}]
