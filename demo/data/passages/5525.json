Anemia is a condition wherein there are low levels of blood cells in the body. Anemia symptoms may include: headache, dizziness, abnormal heart rate, excessive fatigue, pale skin, cold extremities, and breathing difficulties. Each symptom is unique. Generally, some symptoms may be associated with connective tissue disease. Fever is one of the common symptoms of this disease.

Many connective tissue diseases feature abnormal immune system activity with inflammation in tissues as a result of an immune system that is directed against one's own body tissues (autoimmunity). Diseases in which inflammation or weakness of collagen tends to occur are also referred to as collagen diseases. A connective tissue disease is any disease that has the connective tissues of the body as a primary target of pathology.

Connective tissues are made up of two proteins: collagen and elastin. Collagen is a protein found in the tendons, ligaments, skin, cornea, cartilage, bone, and blood vessels. Elastin is a stretchy protein that resembles a rubber band and is the major component of ligaments and skin. When a patient has a connective tissue disease, the collagen and elastin are inflamed."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen_disease", "passage_text": "Collagen disease is a term previously used to describe systemic autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and systemic sclerosis), but now is thought to be more appropriate for diseases associated with defects in collagen, which is a component of the connective tissue.
