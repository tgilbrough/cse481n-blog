[{"url": "http://blog.conservation.org/2010/09/ask-a-turtle-scientist/", "passage_text": "Reply. Turtle walking speeds have not received much study. The average walking speed of a land turtle/tortoise is somewhere under a mile an hour on a smooth level surface, but few tortoises walk for a long enough distance that it is meaningful to measure long-distance walking speed. Sprint speed over short distances is a bit higher, and sprint speed of some freshwater species on land, like softshell turtles and some others, may well exceed five miles per hour for a yard or two going downslope."}, {"url": "http://www.turtles.org/hawgrnd.htm", "passage_text": "Description. The green sea turtle is the largest hard-shelled sea turtle. Adults of this species commonly reach 100 cm in carapace length and 150 kg in mass. The average size of a female nesting at the French Frigate Shoals was reported in 1980 to be 92 cm straight carapace length, with an average body mass of 115 kg.

There are differences in usage of the common terms turtle, tortoise, and terrapin, depending on the variety of English being used; usage is inconsistent and contradictory."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090519190414AA6ZGvN", "passage_text": "This Site Might Help You. RE: How fast can an average sea turtle swim underwater? I know there are seven types of sea turtles, but I would just like to know the average speed of a sea turtle (in general)?

On average, the males are larger than the females. Seventeen species of turtles are found in our state including two species of land-dwelling turtles (box turtles) and fifteen species of aquatic turtles.

Newborn hatchling turtles swim about 25 miles (40 km) in 30 hours on average. Female turtles usually swim at a faster pace than that of their babies or the male turtle in order to protect their young from predators. The marine green turtle (Chelonia mydas) has been known to swim 300 miles (480 km) in 10 days. It has the ability to swim up to 20 mph (9 m/s). The fastest speed of any reptile was found to be 22 mph (9.8 m/s) in the case of a frightened pacific leatherback turtle. Generally, turtles move faster than tortoises, even on land. Tortoises of the genus Gopherus have been clocked at rates 0.13 to 0.30 mph (0.05 to 0.13 m/s). This is compared to the rate on land of a normally aquatic cooter (Pseudemys floridana) which has been recorded at 1.07 mph (0.47 m/s)"}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_average_speed_of_a_turtle", "passage_text": "It is distance traveled over time.
