WMI Query Language (WQL) isn\u2019t so much a dialect as it is a language within a language. You use a scripting language such as VBScript to access and manipulate WMI objects, but you use WQL to retrieve the exact object or objects you want to work with."}, {"url": "http://www.ravichaganti.com/blog/wmi-query-language-wql-an-introduction/", "passage_text": "WMI Query Language (WQL) \u2013 An introduction. written by Ravikanth.

With that background, let us now look at WMI Query Language.

For a complete list of supported WQL keywords, see WQL (SQL for WMI) . Using SQL keywords for object or property names may restrict a query from being parsed. The following SQL keywords are restricted: NULL, TRUE, and FALSE. Note There are limits to the number of AND and OR keywords that can be used in WQL queries. Large numbers of WQL keywords used in a complex query can cause WMI to return the WBEM_E_QUOTA_VIOLATION error code as an HRESULT value. The limit of WQL keywords depends on how complex the query is"}, {"url": "http://www.darkoperator.com/blog/2013/3/11/introduction-to-wmi-basics-with-powershell-part-3-wql-and-se.html", "passage_text": "In fact WQL is Microsoft's implementation of the CIM Query Language (CQL), a query language for the Common Information Model (CIM) standard from the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF).

In PowerShell we are not obligated to use WQL to pull information from WMI like shown in the other blog posts in the series where we queried information using Cmdlets parameters. We find that many of the examples we will see out there in Python, Perl, VBScript, C# and others actually WQL for performing their queries since there is some additional controls on what data to pull and to express the query in a more familiar way for others to understand what it is being done."}, {"url": "http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/46390/WMI-Query-Language-by-Example", "passage_text": "This is probably the WQL query most often found in various WMI articles and textbooks.

Just like in SQL, the \u2018%\u2019 meta character replaces any string of zero or more characters, so this query returns all Win32_Service instances where the Name property contains the string SQL.
