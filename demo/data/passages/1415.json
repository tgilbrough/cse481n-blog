Metals such as copper typify conductors, while most non-metallic solids are said to be good insulators, having extremely high resistance to the flow of charge through them. Conductor implies that the outer electrons of the atoms are loosely bound and free to move through the material. Any external influence which moves one of them will cause a repulsion of other electrons which propagates, domino fashion through the conductor. Simply stated, most metals are good electrical conductors, most nonmetals are not."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20140116194621AA83gHc", "passage_text": "Copper, Gold, and Silver are all good conductors of heat and electricity.
