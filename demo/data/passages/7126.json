In chemistry, a salt is an ionic compound that results from the neutralization reaction of an acid and a base. Salts are composed of related numbers of cations (positively charged ions) and anions (negative ions) so that the product is electrically neutral (without a net charge). The name of a salt starts with the name of the cation (e.g., sodium or ammonium) followed by the name of the anion (e.g., chloride or acetate). Salts are often referred to only by the name of the cation (e.g., sodium salt or ammonium salt) or by the name of the anion (e.g., chloride salt or acetate salt)."}, {"url": "http://www.syvum.com/cgi/online/serve.cgi/squizzes/chem/acids_bases_salts.html", "passage_text": "Chemistry: Acids, Bases & Salts apid Theory you need to know! eview The reaction of an acid with a base to produce only salt and water is called a neutralization reaction.

They may be simple salts such as. A large pile of salt at an Uppington, South Africa, salt mine. NaCl, KCl, and Na 2 SO 4; acid salts like NaHCO 3 and NaH 2 PO 4; or double salts like KAl(SO 4) 2. Table salt is sodium chloride, a chemical compound with the formula NaCl. Sodium chloride has been used to flavor and preserve food for thousands of years. As a result, salt became an essential part of commercial transactions and was often used as money or barter. Salt is used to cure meat and fish by soaking them in brine, rubbing salt onto them, or injecting them with a salt solution. Bacon and cured ham are examples of meats preserved by the use of salt. Salt is also used to make pickles by soaking cucumbers in brine. Rock salt is sprinkled on highways to melt ice."}, {"url": "http://education.seattlepi.com/examples-salts-chemistry-1381.html", "passage_text": "In chemistry, salts are the ionic products when an acid reacts with a base and neutralizes. In the solid form, salts have a neutral charge. They become ions when dissolved in water. Certain salts can be distinguished by color. Chemists will frequently use flame tests to observe the colors produced by exciting the electrons with flames. Many salts are commonly found and used in the home."}, {"url": "http://www.ducksters.com/science/chemistry/soaps_and_salts.php", "passage_text": "In chemistry, salts are ionic compounds that are formed from the neutralization reactions of an acid and a base.
