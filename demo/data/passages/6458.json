Your active and passive range of motion may be very different, not only from each other, but also at the joints themselves. Active range of motion means you move a joint through its range of motion, or ROM. Passive range of motion involves someone else moving a joint for you. Range of motion is the amount of movement you have at each joint. It is related to flexibility and is an important part of an exercise program. Understanding both active and passive ranges of motion and their importance can help you improve your flexibility and performance."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-range-of-motion-rom-definition-types-testing-exercises.html", "passage_text": "To measure range of motion, physical therapists most commonly use a goniometer, which is an instrument used to measure angle at a joint. Goniometers show degrees of an angle from zero to 180 or 360 degrees and are available in different shapes and sizes for the unique joints in the human body. There are three primary types of exercises specific to range of motion. Passive range of motion is typically practiced on a joint that is inactive. The physical therapist may use this exercise on a client who is paralyzed or unable to mobilize a specific joint."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion", "passage_text": "Range of motion (or ROM), is the linear or angular distance that a moving object may normally travel while properly attached to another. Devices to measure range of motion in the joints of the body include the goniometer and inclinometer which use a stationary arm, protractor, fulcrum, and movement arm to measure angle from axis of the joint."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-range-of-motion-rom-definition-types-testing-exercises.html", "passage_text": "Range of motion is the measurement of movement around a joint. Passive range of motion requires full assistance for an individual to move their joint. Active-assistive requires partial assistance, and active range of motion is when the client is able to move their joint independently. There are three primary types of exercises specific to range of motion. Passive range of motion is typically practiced on a joint that is inactive. The physical therapist may use this exercise on a client who is paralyzed or unable to mobilize a specific joint."}, {"url": "http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/range+of+motion", "passage_text": "range of motion the range, measured in degrees of a circle, through which a joint can be extended and flexed; see also range of motion exercises. Range of motion (ROM).

Range of motion is the capacity for movement at a given joint in a specific direction. The anatomy of a joint dictates the normal limits of its range of motion. Health care professionals assess joint movement with two types of range-of-motion testing: active and passive. Therefore, the range of motion for a given joint is tested for each type of movement possible at the site.
