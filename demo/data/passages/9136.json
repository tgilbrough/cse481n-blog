The middle ear consists of the tympanic membrane (3), three tiny bones called ossicles (4), the round window (5), the oval window (6), and the Eustachian tube (7). The tympanic membrane is a very thin structure that separates the external ear canal from the middle ear space. The inner ear consists of three parts: the vestibule (9), the cochlea (10), and the semicircular canals (11). The vestibule is the central inner ear cavity, the cochlea is the organ of hearing, and the semicircular canals are part of the balance system."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear", "passage_text": "The Eustachian tube connects from the chamber of the middle ear to the back of the nasopharynx. The middle ear is very much like a specialized paranasal sinus, called the tympanic cavity; it, like the paranasal sinuses, is a hollow mucosa-lined cavity in the skull that is ventilated through the nose. In most mammals, the visible ear is a flap of tissue that is also called the pinna (or auricle in humans) and is the first of many steps in hearing.
