Ranging from indigestion and irritable bowel syndrome to gastritis and GERD, an aching tummy can stem from many things. 1. Enjoy a Cup of Chamomile Tea. Chamomile can help ease the pain of a stomach ache by working as an anti-inflammatory (for example the lining of the stomach can become inflamed as a result common gastritis, caused by bacteria) and by relaxing the smooth muscle of the upper digestive track."}, {"url": "http://www.top10homeremedies.com/home-remedies/home-remedies-stomach-ache.html", "passage_text": "A stomach ache is a very common problem with varying degrees of discomfort and related symptoms.

Like ginger, fresh mint works the best to settle the stomach, and all you need is a cup of warm water and a few sprigs of mint to make a tea. Simply chewing on a mint leaf also works, and because mint is technically a weed, it grows well in most environments. You can also buy the tea or peppermint supplements."}]
