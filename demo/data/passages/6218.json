Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, while type 1 diabetes is characterized by insulin deficiency, generally without insulin resistance. Another hallmark of type 1 diabetes is islet autoreactivity, which is generally measured by the presence of autoantibodies directed towards the beta cells."}, {"url": "http://mentalhealth.com/mag1/p51-bpcf.html", "passage_text": "Introduction. Bipolar disorder is a chronic disorder that affects approximately one per cent of the world's population, afflicting both males and females. The onset of bipolar disorder usually occurs between 20 to 30 years of age, with a second peak in the mid-40s for women. There is a personality difference between patients with bipolar disorder and those with unipolar depression. Studies have shown that patients with unipolar depression tend to have depressive personalities, even after 15 years' follow up (when patients were no longer sick)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance-related_disorder", "passage_text": "Over 50% of individuals with substance-related disorders will often have a dual diagnosis, where they are diagnosed with the substance abuse, as well as a psychiatric diagnosis, the most common being major depression, personality disorder, anxiety disorders, and dysthymia.

Hypoglycemia is a very common occurrence in people with diabetes, usually the result of a mismatch in the balance among insulin, food and physical activity.
