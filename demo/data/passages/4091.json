An easy way to calculate the units in wine is to take the % strength (ABV), and multiply by the volume (ml), then divide by 1000, as follows %ABV x ml = X X/1000 = units. So, for 175ml of wine at say 13% strength: 13 x 175= 2275 2275/1000 = 2.275 units."}, {"url": "http://community.babycentre.co.uk/post/a22269785/alcohol_-", "passage_text": "Posted 10/11/2012 Vodka and similar are 2.5 syns for a single measure, so with diet coke you can have a few and still be in your syns.
