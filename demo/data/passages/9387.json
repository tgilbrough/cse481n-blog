The cerebellum is located behind the top part of the brain stem (where the spinal cord meets the brain) and is made of two hemispheres (halves). The cerebellum receives information from the sensory systems, the spinal cord, and other parts of the brain and then regulates motor movements. The cerebellum coordinates voluntary movements such as posture, balance, coordination, and speech, resulting in smooth and balanced muscular activity. It is present in animals that scientists believe existed before humans. Damage to the cerebellum, while not causing paralysis or intellectual impairment, might lead to a lack of balance, slower movements, and tremors (shaking)."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_does_the_cerebellum_do", "passage_text": "Split and merge into it. Answer by cat kluss. Confidence votes 51.8K. The cerebellum is the portion of the brain that controls coordination, balance, voluntary motor movements, sense of position of the different parts of your body, equilibrium, and muscle tone. It also plays an important role in memory. The cerebellum is involved in the coordination of voluntary motor movement, balance and equilibrium and muscle tone. It is located just above the brain stem and toward t \u2026 he back of the brain."}]
