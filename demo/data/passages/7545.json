Laryngitis that develops over a short period of time is typically caused by a viral infection, but it can be part of a bacterial infection. A specialist of the ear, nose, and throat can perform tests on the vocal cords to determine the cause of the hoarseness and the appropriate treatment. For most cases of laryngitis, treatment consists of resting the voice box (not talking).

Acute laryngitis is the most common cause of hoarseness and voice loss that starts suddenly. Most cases of acute laryngitis are caused by a viral infection that leads to swelling of the vocal cords. When the vocal cords swell, they vibrate differently, leading to hoarseness.
