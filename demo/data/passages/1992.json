JanMuhamed's central claim is that every writer from the former colonies which seeks to tell the story of his marginalized community to the cultural center will have a difficult task on his hands. The difficulty, JanMuhamed holds, is in locating the postcolonial subject in the center of a literary text."}, {"url": "http://rlwclarke.net/courses/LITS3303/2005-2006/12CJanMohamedEconomyofManicheanAllegory.pdf", "passage_text": "In descri bing the attributes and actions of the native, issues such as. intention, causality, extenuating circumstances, and so forth are completely. ignored; in the \u2018imaginary\u2019 colonialist realm, to say \u2018native\u2019 is automatically to. say \u2018evil\u2019 and to evoke immediately the economy of the manichean allegory.

The ultimate goal was to justify economic exploitation but what began as an ideology of \u201cracial difference\u201d turned into one of \u201cmoral and even metaphysical difference\u201d (pg 80).

What is the constant is the presence of the Manichean allegory, which is what creates stereotypes (pg 87). This, I think, is true especially in the books that I read with the French Senior Major Seminar on the Second French Colonial Empire.

The lama feels that the whole phenomenal world is an illusion and that everyone is deceived by the shadow of appearance (K, p. 286), but Kipling is gently mocking him: he is entirely blind to the fact that his unique disciple is a spy and is using him to thwart the foreign agents."}]
