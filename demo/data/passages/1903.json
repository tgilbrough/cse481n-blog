Calorimetry is a process of measuring the amount of heat involved in a chemical reaction or other process. In this experiment, I used thermometer to see if the chemicals is gaining or losing heat energy. Objectives. To find out the heat released or changed in a reaction. This process can be categorized as Exothermic reaction, because this releases energy during the process.
