[{"url": "http://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/wood-thrush", "passage_text": "Numbers have declined seriously in recent decades. Cowbirds lay many eggs in their nests, so the thrushes often raise mainly cowbirds, with few young of their own. As forests are cut into smaller fragments, it apparently becomes easier for cowbirds to penetrate these small woodlots and find more of the thrush nests.

It is closely related to other thrushes such as the American robin and is widely distributed across North America, wintering in Central America and southern Mexico. The wood thrush is the official bird of the District of Columbia."}, {"url": "http://www.earthlife.net/birds/nests.html", "passage_text": "Perhaps the strangest nests of all are those built by the species of Swiftlet in the genus Collocalia. They nest in caves and build their nests of saliva. To do this they have enlarged salivary glands during the breeding season. To make them even more amazing, these Swiflets often nest in pitch dark caves. Australasian Bowerbirds are not the only birds to build structures that are not ever destined to be nests. Others include the Tooth-billed Cat Bird (Scenopoeetes dentirostris), also from Australia, and Jackson's Whydah (Euplectes jacksoni) from Kenya and Tanzania."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_kind_of_places_do_adult_song_thrushes_make_their_nests", "passage_text": "Barn owls do not build nests as such.

Best Answer: Yes, Cuckoos, cowbirds and owls do not build their own nests. Cuckoos and cowbirds lay their eggs in other birds nests. Some duck species will do this as well, but they will also have their own nest in addition. Owls just take over the nest of another bird, usually a hawk, but they tend to their own young"}, {"url": "http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/funfactsandarticles/features/homesweethome.aspx", "passage_text": "1 House martins, song thrushes and blackbirds use mud in the construction of their nests. 2  A small, wet, muddy patch in your garden, such as a muddy puddle or edge of a pond, may make it easier for them to build a nest, particularly if it has been dry and there are no other nearby sources.
