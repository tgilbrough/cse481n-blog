Many scientists believe that blood is a specialized form of connective tissue. The reason is because of its origin in the bones and the presence of fibers in the form of fibrinogen. Not all liquids can be a connective tissue. The only reason why blood is considered that way is due to the fact that is has a concentration of \u2018ground substances, like calcium, minerals and phosphorus in its extra-cellular matrix. It may not be able to connect things but it is from the same \u2018ebryotic layer, on which all other connective tissues are classified.

Even though it has a different function in comparison to other connective tissues it does have an extracellular matrix. The matrix consists of the plasma, while red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are suspended in the plasma. Lymph. Lymph is another type of fluid connective tissue. This clear fluid originates from blood plasma that exits blood vessels at capillary beds."}]
