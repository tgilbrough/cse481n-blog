Another big difference is that eukaryotic cells have their DNA in a nucleus, but prokaryotic cells have their DNA free-floating in their cytoplasm. As for being alike, they both have those common cellular things, like a plasma membrane, ribosomes, cytoplasm etc.. etc..

Prokaryotic cells have no nucleus. The purpose of the nucleus is to sequester the DNA-related functions of the big eukaryotic cell into a smaller chamber, for the purpose of increased efficiency."}, {"url": "http://www.cod.edu/PEOPLE/FACULTY/FANCHER/ProkEuk.htm", "passage_text": "1 Both cell types have many, many ribosomes, but the ribosomes of the eukaryotic cells are larger and more complex than those of the prokaryotic cell. 2  Ribosomes are made out of a special class of RNA molecules (ribosomal RNA, or rRNA) and a specific collection of different proteins. For example, the prokaryotic cell has a cell wall, and this animal cell does not. However, many kinds of eukaryotic cells do have cell walls. Despite all of these similarities, the differences are also clear."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Eukaryotic_cells_are_differentiated_from_prokaryotic_cells_because_eukaryotic_cells", "passage_text": "Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. Eukaryotic cells have well defined boundaries for its nucleus and organelles. Prokaryotic cells do not have these features and, in fact, lack a membrane for the nucleus entirely. a prokaryotic cell is a cell that does not have a nucleus or membrance covered organelles. and a a eukaryotic is a is a cell that has a nucleus membrane covered organelles. 2 people found this useful.

Differences in cellular structure of prokaryotes and eukaryotes include the presence of mitochondria and chloroplasts, the cell wall, and the structure of chromosomal DNA. 1 The cell walls of prokaryotes are generally formed of a different molecule (peptidoglycan) to those of eukaryotes (many eukaryotes do not have a cell wall at all). 2  Prokaryotes are usually much smaller than eukaryotic cells."}, {"url": "https://ph.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080721031426AAudgMR", "passage_text": "Report Abuse. a plant cell has a cell membrane surrounded by a cell wall made of cellulose. Also a plant cell contains not centrioles. Plants cells are stacked like bricks to give strength to the plant.
