In particular, when he accepts that he must take his family and leave Troy, he is determined to take the household gods along, but since he has been fighting and has blood on his hands both figuratively and literally, he cannot handle them himself and must have them carried by his father, whom he carries on his back."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080312210807AAXWmvn", "passage_text": "Answers.

This force is embedded in ancient Rome\u2019s influence from Greek Stoic philosophy. This thought is true of Aeneas, as mentioned in my last post, specific to his actions in Book 4 with Dido.

It recounts the love of Dido, Queen of Carthage, for the Trojan hero Aeneas, and her despair when he abandons her. A monumental work in Baroque opera, Dido and Aeneas is remembered as one of Purcell's foremost theatrical works. It was also Purcell's first opera, as well as his only all-sung dramatic work. For the myth on which the opera is based, see Aeneid. Dido and Aeneas (Z. 626) is an opera in a prologue and three acts, written by the English Baroque composer Henry Purcell with a libretto by Nahum Tate. The first known performance was at Josias Priest 's girls' school in London no later than the summer of 1689."}]
