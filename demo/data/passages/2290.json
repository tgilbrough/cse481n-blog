It takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. In glycolysis (\u201cglucose breaking\u201d), ATP is used to split glucose molecules into a three-carbon compound called pyruvate. This splitting produces energy that is stored in ATP and a molecule called NADH. 1 Unlike the rest of aerobic respiration, which takes place in the mitochondria, glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. 2  Unlike the rest of aerobic respiration, glycolysis does not require oxygen."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/facts_5895064_respiration-occur_.html", "passage_text": "Respiration usually occurs in the presence of oxygen, but there are cases where respiration takes place without oxygen (anaerobic respiration).

"}, {"url": "http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/biology/celres.html", "passage_text": "All living cells must carry out cellular respiration. It can be aerobic respiration in the presence of oxygen or anaerobic respiration. Prokaryotic cells carry out cellular respiration within the cytoplasm or on the inner surfaces of the cells. More emphasis here will be placed on eukaryotic cells where the mitochondria are the site of most of the reactions. Aerobic respiration, or cell respiration in the presence of oxygen, uses the end product of glycolysis (pyruvate) in the TCA cycle to produce much more energy currency in the form of ATP than can be obtained from any anaerobic pathway."}, {"url": "http://www.enotes.com/homework-help/where-does-anaerobic-respiration-take-place-yeast-279145", "passage_text": "Posted on. (Answer #1). Anaerobic respiration occurs in the cytoplasm of cells. In anaerobic respiration the six carbon sugar glucose is broken down into two three-carbon molecules called pyruvate. This process converts ADP into ATP, which is the cell's energy storage molecule. In yeast, anaerobic respiration results in the production of ethanol, which is a type of alchohol.

The process of generating; well anaerobic respiration also takes in the cell's cytoplasm along, alongside of glycolysis. So this has been a discussion of where respiration actually takes place.

Anaerobic reactions occur in the cytoplasm of the cell and aerobic reactions occur in the mitochondria of the cells. Notice in the picture below that glycolysis is happening in the cytoplasm and everything else is occurring inside the mitochondria, which require oxygen.

It occurs within the cytoplasm (particularly the fluid portion, which is the cytosol).
