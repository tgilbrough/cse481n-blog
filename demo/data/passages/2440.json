(Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue.) Blood and lymph lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.

It is an irregular connective tissue because it does not support or connect things but is labeled as a connective tissue because \u2026 it forms from the same embryotic layer as all other connective tissues. 12 people found this useful. What defines a connective tissue is living cells surrounded by a non-living extracellular matrix. The red and white blood cells are the living cells and the plasma they float \u2026 in is the non-living extracellular matrix therefore blood is classified as a connective tissue. 1 person found this useful."}, {"url": "http://web.clark.edu/rrausch/biolabs/histo/connective/ct_index.html", "passage_text": "Blood (400X).
