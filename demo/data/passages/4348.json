Instead, pragmatists consider thought an instrument or tool for prediction, problem solving and action.

According to Pragmatism, the truth or meaning of an idea or a proposition lies in its observable practical consequences rather than anything metaphysical. William James is the most famous philosopher of Pragmatism and hes the one who made Pragmatism itself famous. For James, Pragmatism was about value and morality: the purpose of philosophy was to understand what had value to us and why."}, {"url": "http://www.philosophytalk.org/shows/american-pragmatism", "passage_text": "What is it: Pragmatism is perhaps America's most distinctive contribution to philosophy. Developed by Pierce, Dewey, and James in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, pragmatism holds that both the meaning and the truth of any idea is a function of its practical outcome.
