Some 2 000 years ago, when the first waves of black settlers began arriving in southern Africa, they brought with them the advantages of an Iron Age culture, farming skills and domesticated crops. After they had settled in the eastern parts of South Africa, they eventually spread out across the highveld some 1 000 years ago, because of their need for more land on which to practise their growing cattle culture. The first African settlements in South Africa were mainly in the Transvaal and Natal areas."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_expansion", "passage_text": "The Bantu expansion is the name for a postulated millennia-long series of migrations of speakers of the original proto-Bantu language group. The primary evidence for this expansion has been linguistic, namely that the languages spoken in Sub-Equatorial Africa are remarkably similar to each other. The Niger\u2013Congo family comprises a huge group of languages spread throughout Sub-Saharan Africa.

The speakers of proto-Bantu are thought to be the ancestors of different groups of people living in east, central, and southern Africa today. Between 500 B.C. and A.D. 200, some of the villages where proto-Bantu speakers lived became crowded. Some people chose to migrate to find more farmland. For the next 2,000 years, descendants of the original proto-Bantu speakers continued migrating across east, central, and southern Africa. 1  the Congo Basin."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/the-bantu-people-migration-language-and-impact.html", "passage_text": "Most historians think Africa's history started with the Bantu peoples, a group of African language speakers (Bantu languages) that originally lived in the notch of western Africa. In around 1500 B.C.E., the Bantu speakers stumbled upon the domestication of yams and bananas. Just like wheat did in Mesopotamia and Egypt and rice did in India and China, having a stable supply of food made dramatic changes for the Bantu. They began domesticating goats at about the same time, as well. The way we know this is through the Bantu languages. Lesson Summary. In about 1500 B.C.E., a group of Bantu language speakers discovered that they could domesticate yams and bananas. They used their new food to increase their population and then spread their knowledge to all of Africa. This would be the first event in a chain reaction."}, {"url": "http://www.eduplace.com/kids/socsci/ca/books/bkf3/imaps/AC_06_206_bantu/AC_06_206_bantu.html", "passage_text": "The dense rain forest did not provide much room for farming.
