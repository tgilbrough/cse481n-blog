Gellan Gum is a gelling agent developed specifically for applications where other gelling agents like agar agar and gelatin are not ideal. There are two types of Gellan Gum: gels made with Low-Acyl Gellan Gum tend to be brittle and firm, while gels made with High-Acyl Gellan Gum are flexible and elastic. The two types also vary slightly in other ways, and there is some additional variability in technical characteristics across various brands"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gellan_gum", "passage_text": "Gellan gum is a water-soluble anionic polysaccharide produced by the bacterium Sphingomonas elodea (formerly Pseudomonas elodea). The gellan-producing bacterium was discovered and isolated by the former Kelco Division of Merck & Company, Inc. in 1978 from the lily plant tissue from a natural pond in Pennsylvania, USA. Gellan was discovered and developed as a commercial biogum hydrocolloid product by Kelco, then a division of Merck & Co. Kelco is solely responsible for obtaining food approval for gellan gum worldwide."}, {"url": "http://chefbytes.co.uk/app/download/5790917015/Gellan+Gum.pdf", "passage_text": "\u00a9chefbytes \u2018unlimited\u2019 www.chefbytes.co.uk Gellan Gum Gellan gum (or E418) is a versatile gelling agent that can produce a wide variety of textures varying from firm, brittle gels that crumble in the mouth, to fluid or elastic gels (depending on conditions & type used).

Acyl is derived from an acidic group of molecules. High-acyl gellan gum forms gels that are very flexible, elastic and that do not break. Low-acyl gellan gum, however, can create strong gels that are crumbly and non-elastic. Gellan gum is used mainly in the food industry as an anti-settling agent, thickener, stabilizer or to structure prepared foods. Used in very small doses, it acts as an anti-settling agent in liquids, while adding only a very light viscosity."}, {"url": "http://eatdrinkbetter.com/2011/08/20/gellan/", "passage_text": "The release also says that \u201cApproved products are non-GMO, Kosher and Halal certified and can be used in vegetarian applications.\u201d. If you want to get a bit more scientific, Gellan is a water-soluble polysaccharide made by fermenting the microbe Sphingomonas elodea. The result is an off-white powder that some companies use in place of agar agar as a vegan/vegetarian gelling agent for things like gummy candies. Speaking of gummy candies! And a Vegetarian Gummy Bear Review! I know, it\u2019s hard to imagine why gummy bears wouldn\u2019t be vegetarian, but most gummy bears contain gelatin, which is an animal product.
