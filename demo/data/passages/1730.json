In steel erection, a new, very narrow working surface is constantly being created as skeletal steel is erected at various heights. For many steel erectors, especially connectors, the work starts at the top level of the structure."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_steel", "passage_text": "Structural steel members, such as I-beams, have high second moments of area, which allow them to be very stiff in respect to their cross-sectional area.

Standard fire tests have shown that structural members which are designed to not be fully exposed to fire can exhibit substantial levels of fire resistance without applied protection.
