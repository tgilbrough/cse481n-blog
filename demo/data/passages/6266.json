Ferritin is a protein in the body that binds to iron; most of the iron stored in the body is bound to ferritin. Ferritin is found in the liver, spleen, skeletal muscles, and bone marrow. Only a small amount of ferritin is found"}, {"url": "http://www.emedicinehealth.com/ferritin_test/article_em.htm", "passage_text": "A ferritin test is a laboratory blood test that measures the amount of ferritin in a person's blood stream.
