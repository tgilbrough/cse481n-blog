Mitochondria are tiny organelles inside cells that are involved in releasing energy from food. This process is known as cellular respiration. It is for this reason that mitochondria are often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell. Cells that need a lot of energy, like muscle cells, can contain thousands of mitochondria."}, {"url": "https://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070723012018AAJzy1v", "passage_text": "\u00b7 just now. Report Abuse. Mitochondria is known as powerhouse of cell because the major part of cellular respiration occurs in it, thereby maximum amount of ATP is generated there. This ATP is the energy provider to all the major/minor vital biological functions. ATP is called the energy/power currency of the cell. Although most of a cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, mitochondria have their own independent genomes.

Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell. They are organelles that act like a digestive system that takes in nutrients, breaks them down, and creates energy for the cell.

Then, glucose enters the cell by special molecules in the membrane called glucose transporters. Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make ATP. That process is done with the Kreb's cycle inside the mitochondria. This ATP is generated with glucose and oxygen (magnesium, CoQ10 and some other helpers)."}, {"url": "http://www.meritnation.com/ask-answer/question/why-is-mitochondria-called-powerhouse-of-the-cell/cell-structure-and-functions/2529907", "passage_text": "5. BEST ANSWER Certified by MeritNation Expert. Mitochondriaare known as the powerhouse of cells. Mitochondria create energy for the cell, and this process of creating energy for the cell is known as cellular respiration. Most chemical reactions involved in cellular respiration occur in the mitochondria. The energy required for various chemical activities needed for life is released by the mitochondria in the form of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) molecules. For this reason, mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of cells."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Why_are_mitochondria_called_the_powerhouse_of_the_cell", "passage_text": "The energy currency of the cell (ATP) is produced in the mitochondria during aerobic respiration and therefore powers the cell's activities. Mitochondria is sometimes called the powerhouse of the cell because it generates the energy that the cell uses and passes it out evenly to other parts of the cell. 4 people found this useful. Edit.

The number of mitochondria in a cell varies widely by organism and tissue type. Although most of a cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, mitochondria have their own independent genomes. According to the endosymbiotic theory, mitochondria are descended from free-living prokaryotes."}]
