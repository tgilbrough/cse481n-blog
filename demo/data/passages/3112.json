Proteins provide the amino acids that are required for building enzymes \u2013 the special proteins that start chemical reactions. These are the same enzymes that break food down so the body can use it. Enzyme reactions break food into compounds that are used by the body. Bread, cheese, and wine, which have been made for thousands of years, all require some sort of enzyme in their preparation process. Today, enzymes are used to improve foods in such ways as flavor, texture, appearance, and nutritional value."}, {"url": "http://www.absorblearning.com/chemistry/demo/units/LR1507.html", "passage_text": "The yeast, which is a type of fungus, contains enzymes which catalyse the breakdown of glucose and other sugars (in the absence of oxygen).

The molecules at the beginning of the process are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity."}, {"url": "http://www.sadgurupublications.com/ContentPaper/2012/7_152_SRCC_2(4)2012_P.pdf", "passage_text": "Enzymes lower the energy required for a reaction to occur, without being used up in the reaction. Many types of industries, to aid in the generation of their products, utilize enzymes. Examples of these products are; cheese, alcohol and bread. Fermentation is a method of generating enzymes for industrial purposes. Fermentation involves the use of microorganisms, like bacteria and yeast to produce the enzymes. There are two methods of fermentation used to produce enzymes. Solid state fermentation Solid-state fermentation (SSF) is another method used for the production of enzymes. Solid-state fermentation involves the cultivation of microorganisms on a solid substrate, such as grains, rice and wheat bran."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzymatic", "passage_text": "Some household products use enzymes to speed up chemical reactions: enzymes in biological washing powders break down protein, starch or fat stains on clothes, and enzymes in meat tenderizer break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew.
