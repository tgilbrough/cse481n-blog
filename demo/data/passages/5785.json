Confidence votes 8.0K. Believe it or not, some porous rocks are considered impermeable. No rock is completely impermeable, but some porous rocks like shale and pumice are mostly impermeable, because the pores are not interconnected, thus not allowing fluids or gases to pass through them. This is why shale makes a good cap-rock, and pumice floats instead of sinking."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Is_pumice_permeable", "passage_text": "Pumice is a form of volcanic glass that is rich in silica. There  are also fairly high amounts of aluminum oxide, sodium oxide, and  potassium oxide.

Pumice is also used commercially in several ways in construction."}]
