The Pleistocene Epoch is typically defined as the time period that began about 1.8 million years ago and lasted until about 11,700 years ago. The most recent Ice Age occurred then, as glaciers covered huge parts of the planet Earth. There have been at least five documented major ice ages during the 4.6 billion years since the Earth was formed \u2014 and most likely many more before humans came on the scene about 2.3 million years ago."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111224135848AAKBv0s", "passage_text": "Report Abuse. An Ice Age (and there was more than one) affects the climate of the entire Earth. Ice doesn't cover the entire Earth during an Ice Age, but where it doesn't, the climate is cooler than in a non-ice-age period. There have also been times in Earth's history when the entire planet was covered in ice. These periods are known as Snowball Earth periods"}, {"url": "http://unmaskingevolution.com/11-iceages.htm", "passage_text": "Ice ages are said to have occurred every 150 million years, and last for at least 1 million years. According to the ice age theory, our current warm period will end with the beginning of another cold phase in 23,000 years time. Geologists claim that there have been 5 major ice ages. Several ice ages are evident in the geological record, the most recent ('The Ice Age') being from about 1 million years ago and lasting until about 10 000 years ago, when the ice retreated to its present polar extent.
