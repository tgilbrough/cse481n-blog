MORB is by far the most common rock type on the Earth's surface, as the entire ocean floor consists of it. Shield Volcanoes. Shield volcanoes are the largest volcanoes on Earth that actually look like volcanoes (i.e. not counting flood basalt flows). The Hawaiian shield volcanoes are the most famous examples. Shield volcanoes are almost exclusively basalt, a type of lava that is very fluid when erupted. For this reason these volcanoes are not steep (you can't pile up a fluid that easily runs downhill)"}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_magma_is_the_most_abundant_type_erupted_at_oceanic_spreading_centers", "passage_text": "The type of volcano and eruption from basaltic magma would be a  cinder cone volcano.

Best Answer: Basalt eruptions are most prevalent in oceanic eruptions, at sea floor spreading zones and formation of island arcs. Felsic eruptions, which are typically granitic or rhyolytic, are more common in continental eruptions. The predominant eruptions are oceanic, so basaltic eruptions are more common. A theory of the evolution of a volcano maintains that eruptions of young volcanoes start out basaltic and become more and more felsic as the volcano matures. This is thought to be to magma differentiation and fractionation. Source(s):"}]
