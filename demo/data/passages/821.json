However, ileitis may be caused by a wide variety of other diseases. These include infectious diseases, spondyloarthropathies, vasculitides, ischemia, neoplasms, medication-induced, eosinophilic enteritis, and others. Backwash ileitis (BWI) refers to inflammation in the distal few centimeters of terminal ileum in patients with ulcerative colitis [ 49 ].

The terminal ileum is located on the right side of the abdominopelvic cavity in the umbilical and hypogastric regions.

The terminal ileum is the distal end of the small intestine that intersects with the large intestine.
