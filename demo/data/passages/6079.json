The host may be an animal, a plant, a fungus, or even another microorganism. There are several substrates including pathways where the pathogens can invade a host. The principal pathways have different episodic time frames, but soil contamination has the longest or most persistent potential for harboring a pathogen.

There are six main types of disease causing agents or pathogens: prions, viruses, bacteria, protozoans, fungi, and macroparasites. These pathogens vary greatly in size and shape, and also in the type of diseases they cause in their host. Pathogens can be microscopic (too small to be seen with the unaided eye) or macroscopic (can be seen with the unaided eye)."}, {"url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26917/", "passage_text": "Summary. Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens, which include bacteria, fungi, protozoa, worms, viruses, and even infectious proteins called prions. Pathogens of all classes must have mechanisms for entering their host and for evading immediate destruction by the host immune system. Most bacteria are not pathogenic. But a pathogen or a parasite, like any other organism, is simply trying to live and procreate. Living at the expense of a host organism is a very attractive strategy, and it is possible that every living organism on earth is subject to some type of infection or parasitism (Figure 25-1)."}]
