For example, the snapdragon flower color is either homozygous for red or white. Complete dominance therefore means that the phenotype of the heterozygote is indistinguishable from that of the dominant homozygote. A classic example of dominance is the inheritance of seed shape (pea shape) in peas.

The first allele is dominant and the second allele is recessive. For genes on an autosome (any chromosome other than a sex chromosome), the alleles and their associated traits are autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. Dominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics.
