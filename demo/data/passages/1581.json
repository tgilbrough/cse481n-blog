When administering narcotic analgesia, monitor for signs and symptoms of overdose, especially respiratory depression and severe sedation.

Schlereth T(1), Birklein F. Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Langenbeckstr. 1, Mainz 55101, Germany. schleret@uni-mainz.de. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and pain interact on many levels of the neuraxis. In healthy subjects, activation of the SNS in the brain usually suppresses pain mainly by descending inhibition of nociceptive transmission in the spinal cord. Furthermore, some experimental data even suggest that the SNS might control peripheral inflammation and nociceptive activation. In the periphery, inflammation or nociceptive activation is enhanced, spinal descending inhibition is reversed to spinal facilitation, and finally the awareness of all these changes will induce anxiety, which furthermore amplifies pain perception, affects pain behavior, and depresses mood."}, {"url": "http://www.acupunctureintegrated.com/articles/hypersensitivity", "passage_text": "A variety of painful or uncomfortable symptoms may occur that are different from the normal sensation of pain and often very alarming or debilitating.

The physiological responses that take place via the sympathetic nervous system and the neuro-endocrine system are numerous and intrinsically linked. A noxious stimulus or pain is a stressor that can threaten homeostasis (a steady physiological state). The adaptive response to such a stress involves physiological changes that, in the initial stages, are useful and are also potentially life-saving."}, {"url": "http://www.practicalpainmanagement.com/resources/pain-self-regulation", "passage_text": "A simple example involves pain in association with muscular injury of a limb.

(January 2009). The sympathetic nervous system is one of the two main divisions of the autonomic nervous system, the other being the parasympathetic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system functions to regulate the body's unconscious actions. The sympathetic nervous system's primary process is to stimulate the body's fight-or-flight response. It is, however, constantly active at a basic level to maintain homeostasis"}]
