The stem cells inside an embryo will eventually give rise to every cell, tissue and organ in the fetus's body. Unlike a regular cell, which can only replicate to create more of its own kind of cell, a stem cell is pluripotent. 1 Embryonic stem cells-Embryonic stem cells include those found within the embryo, the fetus or the umbilical cord blood. 2  Depending upon when they are harvested, embryonic stem cells can give rise to just about any cell in the human body. 3  Adult stem cells-Adult stem cells can be found in infants, children and adults."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_line", "passage_text": "A stem-cell line is a group of stem cells that is cultured in vitro and can be propagated indefinitely.

The blastocyst has an outer-layer of cells called the trophoblast, which will eventually form the protective placenta. Inside the trophoblast is a group of cells called the inner cell mass.

Stem cells are cells which are not terminally differentiated and are therefore able to produce cells of other types. Medical researchers hope they can be used to grow specific tissues or organs. There are three types of stem cells: totipotent, pluripotent, and multipotent. A single totipotent stem cell can grow into an entire organism. Another controversy in the use of embryonic stem cells is the use of therapeutic cloning. This involves the cloning of early embryos from which stem cells are harvested, providing a larger source of the cells. Many see this as encouraging human cloning, which they think could be dangerous or unethical."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell", "passage_text": "Stem cells can also be taken from umbilical cord blood just after birth. Of all stem cell types, autologous harvesting involves the least risk. By definition, autologous cells are obtained from one's own body, just as one may bank his or her own blood for elective surgical procedures.
