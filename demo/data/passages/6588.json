Spikes, like those on a radiolarian, help to distribute its weight over a large surface area and slowing its sinking. Many organisms, such as copepods and diatoms, produce oil to keep them afloat."}, {"url": "http://www.whoi.edu/science/B/people/kamaral/plankton.html", "passage_text": "That places them at the very base of the food web.
