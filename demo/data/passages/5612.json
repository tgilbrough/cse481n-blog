This speeds up operations of the processor by helping to reduce fetch latency, i.e. to improve the probability that an opcode byte fetched by the processor is already available. The main point here is that, fetching of the next instruction is overlapped with the execution of current instruction. This is called pipe lining pipe lining saves time required for executing instructions."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_main_purpose_of_technical_directions", "passage_text": "The purpose of technical writing is to inform the reader of  something.

The description of the basic operation of a CPU offered in the previous section describes the simplest form that a CPU can take. This type of CPU, usually referred to as subscalar, operates on and executes one instruction on one or two pieces of data at a time."}, {"url": "http://www.explainers.com/Articles/Four-Essentials-Effective-Work-Instructions.htm", "passage_text": "Overview: Returning the Focus to the Worker. A work instruction is a tool provided to help someone to do a job correctly. This simple statement implies that the purpose of the work instruction is quality and that the target user is the worker.

We've already seen some simple examples of instructions, i.e., add and addi. The CPU executes the binary representation of the instructions, i.e., machine code. Since programs can be very large, and since CPUs have limited memory, programs are stored in memory (RAM). To fetch an instruction involves the following steps: 1  CPU must place an address to the MAR. 2  CPU must activate the tri-state buffer so MAR contents are placed on the address bus. 3  CPU sends R/\\W = 1 and CE = 1 to memory, to indicate it wants to do a read. 4  Memory eventually puts instruction on the data bus."}, {"url": "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/instruction", "passage_text": "1 disciple, discipline-Disciple comes from a Latin word meaning learner and discipline comes from one meaning instruction, knowledge.. 2  document-First meant instruction or evidence, whether written or not. 3  lore-Originally meant the act of teaching or a piece of instruction, lesson.. in\u00b7struc\u00b7tion. n. 1.
