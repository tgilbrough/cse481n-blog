The letters pH stand for power of hydrogen and the numerical value is defined as the negative base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration of hydrogen ions. pH = -log. The measurement of the pH of a sample can be done by measuring the cell potential of that sample in reference to a standard hydrogen electrode, as in the accepted procedure for measuring standard electrode potentials."}, {"url": "http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/elchem/ec3.html", "passage_text": "Ecell = VM \u2013 Vsolution. which is just the potential (relative to that of the SHE) of the half-cell whose reaction is.

In SI, acceleration is measured in meters / second2, or meters / second / second. In other units, units of the same dimension have to be used, i.e., [length] / [time] / [time] \u2026 .

Therefore, standard electrode potential is commonly written as standard reduction potential. Although the overall potential of a cell can be measured, there is no simple way to accurately measure the electrode/electrolyte potentials in isolation."}]
