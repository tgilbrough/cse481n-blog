[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostimulation", "passage_text": "The primary advantage of biostimulation is that bioremediation will be undertaken by already present native microorganisms that are well-suited to the subsurface environment, and are well distributed spatially within the subsurface. Investigations to determine subsurface characteristics (such as natural groundwater velocity during ambient conditions, hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface, and lithology of the subsurface) are important in developing a successful biostimulation system."}, {"url": "https://www.estheticon.com/procedures/biostimulation-laser-treatment", "passage_text": "Biostimulation Laser Treatment Follow this procedure. Biostimulation treatments use a laser to deliver healing heat to the patient's skin. Biostimulation treatments can be used to treat scars, inflammatory processes of the skin or to regenerate and oxidize the skin. The procedure is non-invasive, painless and there are no post-treatment restrictions. Its location in Central Europe is easy to access; its mild climate is conducive to healing and its experienced clinics and biostimulation laser treatment surgeons ensure you'll receive the best possible care. Biostimulation treatment Prague costs are often much more affordable than in the UK or with the NHS."}, {"url": "http://bioremediationmadesimple.weebly.com/", "passage_text": "The first type of bioremediation is biostimulation; nutrients in a gas or liquid form are added to soil or water where there is a need to remove contaminants. The bacteria are already there they are just stimulated to encourage growth and activity. Essencially the he bacteria turn the harmful substances in to CO2. Bio augmentation. The second type of bioremediation is bio augmentation, where microorganisms are added to the soil to help remove contaminants. It is more commonly used in contaminants in the original site, and is more successful."}, {"url": "http://www.adbio.com/biorem/why_add_microbes.htm", "passage_text": "Biological treatment techniques fall into two categories, biostimulation and bioaugmentation. Biostimulation refers to the addition of specific nutrients to a waste situation with the hope that the correct, naturally occurring microbes are present in sufficient numbers and types to break down the waste effectively. This assumes that every organism needed to accomplish the desired treatment results is present"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostimulation", "passage_text": "Removal of the contaminated material is also an option, albeit an expensive one. Biostimulation can be enhanced by bioaugmentation. This process, overall, is referred to as bioremediation and is an EPA-approved method for reversing the presence of oil or gas spills.

In a place filled with contamination, microbial life usually finds it as a place to call home. The biological material that originated in this contaminated area is able to break down waste, but when the amount of waste overloads it needs help from a foreign form to increase performance in breaking down chemicals. Bioaugmentation develops the biological material in order to smoothly break down certain compounds."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioremediation", "passage_text": "Bioremediation is a waste management technique that involves the use of organisms to remove or neutralize pollutants from a contaminated site. According to the EPA, bioremediation is a \u201ctreatment that uses naturally occurring organisms to break down hazardous substances into less toxic or non toxic substances\u201d. Technologies can be generally classified as in situ or ex situ"}, {"url": "http://www.adbio.com/biorem/why_add_microbes.htm", "passage_text": "Biostimulation vs. Bioaugmentation Bioremediation uses naturally occurring microorganisms to degrade various types of wastes. Like all living creatures, microbes need nutrients, carbon, and energy to survive and multiply. Biostimulation refers to the addition of specific nutrients to a waste situation with the hope that the correct, naturally occurring microbes are present in sufficient numbers and types to break down the waste effectively."}]
