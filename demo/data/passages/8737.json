B. Effect of pH One mL of acetate buffer (pH 4) and one mL 2% unbuffered starch were mixed in a large test tube. Two mL of the enzyme solution was added in a separate large test tube. Both the test tubes were incubated for ten minutes in a 37\u00b0C water bath. Results and Discussion The effect of temperature and pH on the enzymatic activity of salivary amylase was determined by measuring the rates of reaction in varying temperatures and pH. The 0.5% NaCl added in the enzyme solution activates the salivary amylase to perform its function \u2013 to hydrolyze starch."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_optimum_pH_and_temperature_of_salivary_amylase", "passage_text": "Answer by Rimshakr27. Confidence votes 3.7K. Answer Amylase has an optimal pH range of 6.7 - 7.0 and an optimal temperature of around 37 degrees Celsius or 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. This is what would be expected of an enzyme that needs to be in its most active form in the saliva of the mouth. Answer   It depends on what amylase you're talking about.

Amylase is an enzyme, which you can find in your mouth. It catalyses the hydrolysis of starch. Rates of enzyme-catalysed reactions depend on pH and temperature. The optimum temperature is about 40oC because the average human body temperature is 37oC. The optimum pH is the neutral one because your mouth has a 7 pH."}, {"url": "http://data.biitbook.com/BIOCHEM-LAB---Enzymatic-Activity-of-Salivary-Amylase.pdf", "passage_text": "Figure 1 shows that the optimum temperature of salivary amylase ranges from 32\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C.This applies to the human body since salivary amylase is suitable to function within these temperatures. After 37\u00b0C, the graph then steeply declines as a result of loss of activity. At 50\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C, salivary amylase is denatured.
