The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the circulatory system and protects the central nervous system (CNS) from potentially harmful chemicals while regulating transport of essential molecules and maintaining a stable environment.

Blood brain barrier is formed by specific nueroglial cells called astrocytes.These astrocytes are of two types :1) Fibrous astrocytes and 2) protoplasmic astrocytes. The fibres of these astrocytes forms a network with capillaries of blood vessels that supply blood to brain.
