During binary fission, the single DNA molecule replicates and the original cell is divided into two identical cells. 1  Binary fission begins with the single DNA molecule replicating and both copies attaching to the cell membrane. Prokaryotic cells are not as complex as eukaryotic cells. They have no true nucleus as the DNA is not contained within a membrane or separated from the rest of the cell, but is coiled up in a region of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. Prokaryotic organisms have varying cell shapes."}, {"url": "http://biology.about.com/b/2009/09/23/binary-fission.htm", "passage_text": "Bacterial reproduction most commonly occurs by a kind of cell division called binary fission.

Conceptually this is a simple process; a cell just needs to grow to twice its starting size and then split in two.

The timing of binary fission is important, as organisms must do it at the right moment. The process is partially regulated by the septal ring, a ring of proteins which forms around the middle of the cell, encouraging it to split evenly without damaging the DNA or the cell wall. In this process, two daughter cells are produced by a single parent cell which effectively clones itself.
