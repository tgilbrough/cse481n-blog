bit of planning will radically increase your chances 1 in short good periods are between late september and late march statistically there are more aurora display in proximity of the two equinoxes some of these particularly near solar activity maximum can lead to visible northern lights remarkably far south if you re in an area with clear transparent night skies the alerts section below will help you stay on top of solar activity and prepare for some viewing when a solar storm does occur"}, {"url": "http://goscandinavia.about.com/od/knowledgesafety/ss/northern-lights.htm", "passage_text": "the northern lights are one of the big three natural phenomena created by our sun s magnetic activity the northern lights are caused by large numbers of electrons that stream towards the earth along a magnetic field and collide with air particles in our sky the air then lights up rather like what happens in a fluorescent light tube and what we see is the northern lights also called aurora borealis red northern lights are rare but you can enjoy them in our photo gallery a more scientific explanation of what the northern lights are the northern lights are created with sufficient
