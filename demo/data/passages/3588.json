At the beginning of the current year, the company estimated that its manufacturing overhead would total $220,000 during the year. During the year, the company incurred $200,000 in actual manufacturing overhead costs.uring the month, the following costs were incurred on Job 1041: direct materials $54,800 and direct labor $19,200.

The total overhead expenditure is then divided by the total labor hours to arrive at the overhead rate. If, in the example, total overhead amounts to $120,000 a year, the overhead rate will be $120,000 divided by 30,000 hours, or $4 per hour. As each unit requires three hours of labor, the indirect cost of each unit is $4 x 3, or $12.
