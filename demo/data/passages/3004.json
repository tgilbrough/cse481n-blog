It is important to note that the effects of ischemic stroke are almost always contralateral and therefore unilateral. One exception to this pattern is alternating hemiplegia. This is a paralysis that can be caused by ischemic stroke and affects different structures on each side of the body. It results from a brain stem lesion that damages cranial nerve nuclei and one side of the pyramidal tract in the same area."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080109190610AADAaEA", "passage_text": "In some theories, the pons has a role in dreaming. The pons is part of the brainstem, the lowest part of the brain that connects to the top end of the spinal cord. It's an important and densely packed area containing many bundles of nerves carrying movement and sensory messages between the brain and the body.

Occlusion of large vessels in this system usually leads to major disability or death. Vertebrobasilar stroke carries a mortality rate of more than 85%. Proximal to its bifurcation into the terminal branches (PCAs), the basilar artery gives off the superior cerebellar arteries that supply the lateral aspect of the pons and midbrain, as well as the superior surface of the cerebellum."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pons", "passage_text": "The pons is part of the brainstem, and in humans and other bipeds lies between the midbrain (above) and the medulla oblongata (below) and in front of the cerebellum. The pons is also called the pons Varolii (bridge of Varolius), after the Italian anatomist and surgeon Costanzo Varolio (1543\u201375). This white matter includes tracts that conduct signals from the brain down to the cerebellum and medulla, and tracts that carry the sensory signals up into the thalamus. The pons in humans measures about 2.5 cm or 1 inch in length. Most of it appears as a broad anterior bulge rostral to the medulla. Posteriorly, it consists mainly of two pairs of thick stalks called cerebellar peduncles."}]
