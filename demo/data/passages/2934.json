However, more specifically, aerobic respiration occurs in the MITOCHONDRIAL MATRIX or on the inside of the inner membrane of mitochondria (the powerhouse of the cell). In contrast, anaerobic respiration (without O2) strictly occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell (a process called GLYCOLYSIS)."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Which_type_of_respiration_occurs_inside_the_mitochondrion", "passage_text": "Well, a mitochondrion is an organelle found in large numbers in most cells, in which the biochemical processes of respiration and energy production occur. It has a doubl \u2026 e membrane, the inner layer being folded inward to form layers (cristae). Farandolae live in mitochondrion."}, {"url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Cell_Organelles/Mitochondria", "passage_text": "The purpose of the mitochondria in the eukaryote is to provide cellular respiration to the cell. The endosymbiotic theory asserts that the mitochondria came to be part of the eukaryote over time through a symbiotic relationship. The mitochondria consists of two membranes, the inner membrane and the outer membrane."}, {"url": "http://www.weegy.com/?ConversationId=8D9C01D2", "passage_text": "User: Which type of respiration occurs inside the mitochondrion?

Inside the deepest compartments of the mitochondria is the mitochondrian matrix. It is in the matrix that cellular respiration occurs, where pyruvate (a product of glycolysis in the cytosol) is converted to Carbon Dioxide and water."}]
