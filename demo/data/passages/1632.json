These particles and grains have become solid rock by the processes of compaction or cementation of sediments. A sedimentary rock is a layered rock that is formed from the compaction, cementation, and the recrystallization of sediments. Compaction is the squeezing together of layers of sediment due to the great weight of overlying layers of rock."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_type_of_rock_can_be_the_source_of_deposited_sediments", "passage_text": "Rock sediments are deposited at the bottom of a body of water, such  as a river or lake. When the flow of water changes direction, the  sediment has different momentum, so i \u2026 t does not change direction as  fast, and it will collide with the river bank and then settle. All forms of rock can weather and form sediment that is carried by water, wind or glaciers. Some just break down more easily than others. Example One is fine grained igneous b \u2026 asalt (lava) that is very difficult to break down."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentary_rock", "passage_text": "Sedimentary rocks are formed when sediment is deposited out of air, ice, wind, gravity, or water flows carrying the particles in suspension. This sediment is often formed when weathering and erosion break down a rock into loose material in a source area. The material is then transported from the source area to the deposition area. The type of sediment transported depends on the geology of the hinterland (the source area of the sediment).
