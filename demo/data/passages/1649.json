Isogonic lines are lines on the Earth's surface along which the declination has the same constant value, and lines along which the declination is zero are called agonic lines. Magnetic declination should not be confused with magnetic inclination, also known as magnetic dip, which is the angle that the Earth's magnetic field lines make with the downward side of the horizontal plane."}, {"url": "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/magnetic+declination", "passage_text": "magnetic declination-the angle (at a particular location) between magnetic north and true north. magnetic variation, variation. angle-the space between two lines or planes that intersect; the inclination of one line to another; measured in degrees or radians. magnetic declination.
