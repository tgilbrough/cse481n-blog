The nucleolus (nucleoli, plural) is one of the most important components of the cell nucleus, and is far the most easily recognized substructure in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It can easily be determined by phase contrast microscopy and with the use of different dyes. Define Nucleolus. The definition of nucleolus can be described as the place where the biogenesis of ribosomal subunits and ribosomal rRNA occurs. Or that of a non-membrane bound structure that is also composed of nucleic acids, found within the nucleus."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-a-nucleolus-definition-function-quiz.html", "passage_text": "It is not surrounded by a membrane but sits in the nucleus. The nucleolus makes ribosomal subunits from proteins and ribosomal RNA, also known as rRNA. It then sends the subunits out to the rest of the cell where they combine into complete ribosomes. Ribosomes make proteins; therefore, the nucleolus plays a vital role in making proteins in the cell"}, {"url": "http://biology.about.com/od/cellanatomy/p/nucleus.htm", "passage_text": "The Cell Nucleus: The cell nucleus is a membrane bound structure that contains the cell's hereditary information and controls the cell's growth and reproduction. It is the command center of a eukaryotic cell and is commonly the most prominent organelle in a cell. Distinguishing Characteristics: The Nucleolus: Contained within the nucleus is a dense structure composed of RNA and proteins called the nucleolus. The nucleolus contains nucleolar organizers, which are parts of chromosomes with the genes for ribosome synthesis on them."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleolus", "passage_text": "The talk page may contain suggestions.
