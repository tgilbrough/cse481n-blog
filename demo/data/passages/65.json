A condition in which the sugar (glucose) levels in the blood increase abnormally is known as Diabetes mellitus, simply referred to as diabetes. Pancreas in the human body produces a hormone called insulin which helps convert the sugar into energy. In diabetes the body either fails to produce insulin or is unable to respond to it. This increases the quantity of sugar in the blood. Most diabetic patients are prone to heart diseases and stroke. Excess of sugar in the blood affects various body parts including the blood vessels such as the arteries, capillaries and veins.

Diabetes is a disease in which the body's blood glucose, or blood sugar, level is too high. Normally, the body breaks down food into glucose and then carries it to cells throughout the body.
