There are four types of Chiari malformations: Type I. This is by far the most commonly observed type in children. In this type, the lower part of the cerebellum -- but not the brain stem -- extends into an opening at the base of the skull. The opening is called the foramen magnum. Type I is the only type of Chiari malformation that can be acquired. Type II. This is usually only seen in children born with spina bifida. Spina bifida is the incomplete development of the spinal cord and/or its protective covering. Type II is also known as classic Chiari malformation or Arnold-Chiari malformation"}, {"url": "http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/chiari/detail_chiari.htm", "passage_text": "Chiari malformations (CMs) are structural defects in the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance. Normally the cerebellum and parts of the brain stem sit in an indented space at the lower rear of the skull, above the foramen magnum (a funnel-like opening to the spinal canal). When part of the cerebellum is located below the foramen magnum, it is called a Chiari malformation."}, {"url": "http://www.healthgrades.com/symptoms/chiari-malformation", "passage_text": "Chiari malformation refers to a deformity of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is the part of the brain that controls coordination and movement execution. It is located at the back and lower portion of the brain. Common symptoms that occur with Chiari malformation include neck pain, dizziness or vertigo, difficulty with vision, coordination problems, and muscle weakness. Symptoms of Chiari malformation may get worse when you cough, sneeze, or stretch your neck."}, {"url": "http://asap.org/index.php/disorders/chiari-malformation/", "passage_text": "(Pronunciation).
