A blood or urine test for pregnancy is meant to detect if hCG, the pregnancy hormone, is present in either blood or urine. After you ovulate, your egg is fertilized by a sperm after unprotected sex and it then travels through your fallopian tube to the uterus. This produces the hCG hormone which can now be detected in the blood and later in the urine. Implantation takes place when a fertilized egg is embedded into the inner wall of the uterus. This occurs about one week after your ovulation, although this may range from 6 to 12 days. It will take another 3 to 4 days (approximately 9 to 16 days post-ovulation) for your blood test to become positive. After 2 to 3 days an early urine test for pregnancy or a Home Pregnancy Test (HPT) may turn positive"}, {"url": "http://www.newhealthadvisor.com/How-Soon-After-Implantation-BPF.html", "passage_text": "1 Testing too early. 2  If you test too soon after conception and before implantation, you may get a negative test result. 3  Also, if you test after the fourth month of pregnancy there is very little hCG in the urine. 4  After menopause, go to the doctor for a blood test. They have highly sensitive blood tests that can detect the pregnancy hormone (hCG) a few days earlier around day 3 to 4 after implantation.

If you are pregnant, a urine pregnancy test is not expected to be positive until 3-4 days after implantation (at the very earliest), which is about 10 days after ovulation/fertilization and 4 days before the next period. About 51% of pregnant women have a positive pregnancy test 2 days before their next expected period. It takes at least 2-3 days after implantation for there to be enough HCG in your system to be detected by the most sensitive test available, First Response Early Result. If you do test and it's negative, don't fret, just wait a couple more days and test again with the First Response Early Result.
