The pure metal is absorbed easily by inhalation, ingestion or through the skin. It is also a chronic pollutant and mercury concentrates in animal/fish tissues in increasing amounts up the food chain. It is the only common metal that is liquid at room temperature. Mercury evaporates slowly at room temperature. Others metals that are liquid near room temperature are gallium, francium and cesium. The metal is relatively stable in dry air, but in moist air tarnishes slowly to form a gray oxide coating."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_%28element%29", "passage_text": "Mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide). The red pigment vermilion, a pure form of mercuric sulfide, is mostly obtained by reaction of mercury (produced by reduction from cinnabar) with sulfur. Mercury(II) oxide, the main oxide of mercury, arises when the metal is exposed to air for long periods at elevated temperatures.

Mercury is a transition metal. A transition metal is one of the elements found between Groups 2 (IIA) and 13 (IIIA) on the periodic table. The periodic table is a chart that shows how chemical elements are related to one another. Mercury has long been known as quicksilver, because it is a silver liquid. Mercury is the only liquid metal. In fact, there is only one other liquid element, bromine. Bromine is a non-metal. Mercury can be frozen (changed into a solid) at a temperature of \u201338.85\u00b0C (\u201337.93\u00b0F). It can be changed into a gas (boiled) at 365.6\u00b0C (690.1\u00b0F).

Cinnabar (aka vermilion, mercury sulfide, HgS), was used as a bright red pigment by the Palaeolithic painters of 30,000 years ago to decorate caves in Spain and France. Mercury easily forms alloys, called amalgams, with other metals such as gold, silver and tin. The ease with which it amalgamates with gold made it useful in recovering gold from its ores. Mercury amalgams were also used in dental fillings."}, {"url": "http://www.dartmouth.edu/~toxmetal/mercury/history.html", "passage_text": "Speed and mobility were characteristics of the Roman god, Mercury, who served as a messenger to all the other gods and shared his name with the planet nearest the sun.
