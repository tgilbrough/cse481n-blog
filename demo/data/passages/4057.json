When the 'Class Width' is multiplied by the 'Frequency Density' then the Frequency is given. A skew is a measure of distribution. Depending on how the Histogram is, it would have a shape. If the axis of symmetry is in the middle, then this is a symmetric"}, {"url": "http://www.pythagorasandthat.co.uk/histograms-and-frequency-density", "passage_text": "Frequency = Frequency Density x Class Width. And this equals the area of the bar! If you\u2019re going to draw a histogram you first need to find the class boundaries and class widths. Example: The table below shows the heights of children in a class. Draw a histogram based on the data. First add columns with class width and frequency density to the table. Now you can draw your histogram. Note: In an exam you might just be given a histogram like this and asked, for example, how many children are between 80cm and 90cm. All you would need to do it work out the area of the bar between these values:"}, {"url": "http://www.gcsemathstutor.com/histograms.php", "passage_text": "The frequency density is a the frequency of values divided by the class width of values. The area of each block/bar represents the total of frequencies for a particular class width. The width of the block/bar(along the x-axis) relates to the size of the"}]
