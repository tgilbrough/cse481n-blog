Since the saline waters leave coarse particles all year, it is nearly impossible to distinguish the individual layers in salt waters. The classic varve archetype is a light / dark coloured couplet deposited in a glacial lake. The light layer usually comprises a coarser laminaset of silt and fine sand deposited under higher energy conditions when meltwater introduces sediment load into the lake water."}, {"url": "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/revolution", "passage_text": "1 rebellion, revolution-Rebellion is open resistance to a government or authority; revolution is a rebellion that succeeds in overthrowing the government and establishing a new one. 2  rev-An abbreviation of revolution. 1 gyre-A circular movement or revolution; to cause to spin around or whirl. 2  rebellion, revolution-Rebellion is open resistance to a government or authority; revolution is a rebellion that succeeds in overthrowing the government and establishing a new one. 3"}, {"url": "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/revolution", "passage_text": "6. a cycle of successive events or changes. 7.
