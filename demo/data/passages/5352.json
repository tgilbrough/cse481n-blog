They are homologous to Bartholin's glands in females. The bulbourethral glands are compound tubulo-alveolar glands, each approximately the size of a pea in humans.

It is about the size of a walnut and encircles the urethra as it leaves the urinary bladder. Numerous short ducts from the substance of the prostate gland empty into the prostatic urethra. Secretions from the seminal vesicles make up about 60 percent of the volume of the semen, with most of the remainder coming from the prostate gland.

Pre-ejaculate fluid, produced solely by the Cowper\u2019s gland, serves three main functions. It's slightly alkaline, so it neutralizes acid levels in a man's urethra so that his sperm can move freely."}]
