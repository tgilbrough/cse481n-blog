These modern-day windmills convert mechanical energy from the wind into electrical power.

Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical power. This mechanical power can be used for specific tasks (such as grinding grain or pumping water) or a generator can convert this mechanical power into electricity to power homes, businesses, schools, and the like. Wind is a form of solar energy. Winds are caused by the uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun, the irregularities of the earth's surface, and rotation of the earth.

The term appears to have migrated from parallel hydroelectric technology (rotary propeller). The technical description for this type of machine is an aerofoil-powered generator. Onshore wind turbines are installed in low wind speed areas and getting higher and higher towers. Usual towers of multi megawatt turbines have a height of 70m to 120m and in extremes up to 160m. All turbines are rotating with a speed, that the blade tip speed reach 80 m/s to 90 m/s."}, {"url": "http://energy.gov/eere/wind/how-do-wind-turbines-work", "passage_text": "Wind turbines operate on a simple principle. The energy in the wind turns two or three propeller-like blades around a rotor. The rotor is connected to the main shaft, which spins a generator to create electricity.

Converting Wind to Mechanical Energy. Wind is converted by the blades of wind turbines. The blades of the wind turbines are designed in two different ways, the drag type and lift type. \u2022 Drag type: this blade design uses the force of the wind to push the blades around."}, {"url": "http://energy.gov/eere/wind/how-do-wind-turbines-work", "passage_text": "View the wind turbine animation to see how a wind turbine works or take a look inside.
