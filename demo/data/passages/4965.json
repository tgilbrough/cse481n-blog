The average rate for full time is $115.00 a week. that means you can come Monday thru Friday 7 am to 5:30 Pm. Even if you have the day off, you are more than welcome to bring your child. That cost includes food and activities as well. I lived in Nebraska and found a home daycare for my 2 children for $200 a week (they were 18 months and 4 years old). For that part of the country I'd say anything under $100 is good, around $100 reasonable and at around $150 high unless you are getting a lot of structure/teaching/attention, etc. all weekly costs."}, {"url": "http://www.babycenter.com/0_how-much-youll-spend-on-childcare_1199776.bc", "passage_text": "The average cost of center-based daycare in the United States is $11,666 per year ($972 a month), but prices range from $3,582 to $18,773 a year ($300 to $1,564 monthly), according to the National Association of Child Care Resource & Referral Agencies (NACCRRA).
