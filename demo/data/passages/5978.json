A neurotransmitter, derived from Tryptophan, that is involved in sleep, depression, memory, and other neurological processes. I assume you mean serotonin, which is a neurotransmitter in your body. To do this, the impulse triggers the release of a transmitter chemical (such as serotonin) from the end of the neurone into the synapse. 3. These transmitter chemical molecules diffuse across the gap between the two neurones, and bind to special receptor molecules on the membrane (outer skin) of the next neurone. 4."}, {"url": "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/melatonin", "passage_text": "A hormone, C 13 H 16 N 2 O 2, derived from serotonin and produced by the pineal gland.

Biochemically derived from tryptophan, serotonin is primarily found in the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract), blood platelets, and the central nervous system (CNS) of animals, including humans. It is popularly thought to be a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness. Serotonin secreted from the enterochromaffin cells eventually finds its way out of tissues into the blood.

Within the pineal gland, serotonin is acetylated and then methylated to yield melatonin. Synthesis and secretion of melatonin is dramatically affected by light exposure to the eyes.

There are two types of tyrosine derived hormones: thyroid hormone and catecholamines. Thyroid hormone is one of the most important in the body because it regulates the development of organs and metabolism. Norepinephrine and epinephrine are catecholamines. Both are stress hormones and are also neurotransmitters."}]
