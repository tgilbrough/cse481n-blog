It creates high-voltage electricity at a high frequency. And when you produce this kind of electricity, you can do cool things like power light-bulbs with no wires. A Tesla Coil works much in the same way your cell phone charger works, but in reverse. Instead of reducing voltage, it increases it. This is called a transformer. It has two main sets of windings, a primary winding and a secondary winding."}, {"url": "http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Tesla-Coil", "passage_text": "1 (For a Tesla coil, this is optimum operating point for transferring electrical energy between the primary and secondary coils.)

Every Tesla coil consists of a primary LC circuit that excites a secondary circuit. Solid-state and spark-gap coils vary in how they drive the primary sides of the coil. Solid-state coils have a number of common sub-varieties as well. Spark gap coils use an air gap to control the primary current. Using a transformer (often a neon sign transformer or \u201cNST\u201d) , a primary capacitor is charged to a high voltage.

Resonant, basically meaning 'in tune', and transformer, meaning the things you find in almost every household appliance used to step up or down the voltage. In the case of a tesla coil, the voltage is stepped up. Tesla coils are nothing to joke about-they can generate very dangerous voltages, so one must be careful when working with them. To hit an electric circuit into resonance, two basic components are required.
