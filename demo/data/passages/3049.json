While the true speed of a sound wave in soft tissue will vary depending on the density and elasticity of the tissue it is passing through, for the purposes of ultrasound physics, the speed is assumed to be the same as the speed through water."}, {"url": "http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/velocity+of+ultrasound", "passage_text": "velocity of ultrasound, the speed of ultrasound waves in a particular medium. The velocity varies from 331 meters per second (m/sec) in air to 1450 m/sec in fat, 1570 m/sec in blood, and 4080 m/sec in the skull."}, {"url": "http://www.hexamite.com/hetheory.htm", "passage_text": "At salinity level of 35 parts per thousand, depth 0 meters and temperature 0 degrees, speed of sound is 1449.3 m/s. Speed of sound in air is nominally 346m/s at 25 degrees, this speed drops to 331 at 0 degrees. The temperature dependency is second order given that other parameters are constant."}, {"url": "http://www.wikiecho.org/wiki/Physics_of_ultrasound", "passage_text": "Velocity-The speed at which sound propagates through a given medium. Velocity through a given medium is inversely related to the density and directly related to stiffness of that medium. Ultrasound waves travel faster through a stiff medium, such as bone. In echocardiography, the velocity of sound is assumed to be approximately 1,540 m/sec (or 1.54 m/msec). Sound waves travel through the air with speed of 330 m/s. The typical velocities for different tissues are provided in table 1."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound", "passage_text": "The speed of sound is the distance travelled per unit time by a sound wave propagating through an elastic medium. The SI unit of speed is the metre per second (m/s). In dry air at 20 \u00b0C, the speed of sound is 343.2 metres per second (1,126 ft/s)."}]
