            <td class="reference">whether or not alcohol is “fattening” is a very controversial subject , mainly because the main fate of alcohol is not to be stored as fat . in fact , less than 5 % of the alcohol you drink is turned into fat . 1 a small portion of the alcohol is converted into fat . 2 of the 24 grams of alcohol consumed in this study , roughly 3 % was turned into fat . 3 your liver then converts most of the alcohol into acetate . 4 the acetate is released into your bloodstream and takes precedence over the metabolism of protein , carbohydrate , and fat . <hr>alcohol , also known as ethanol , is made through a process called fermentation . during fermentation , yeast breaks sugar down into ethanol and carbon dioxide . this process is done without any air present and once complete , the carbon dioxide gas bubbles out into the air , leaving ethanol and water behind . the proof of a beverage is twice the alcohol content , so a drink with 12 % alcohol per volume is 24 proof . generally , a 12-ounce glass of beer , a 5-ounce glass of wine , and a 1.5-ounce shot of liquor all contain a ½ ounce of pure alcohol and are considered one drink . continue reading . <hr>a liquor store is a retail shop that sells prepackaged alcoholic beverages — typically in bottles — intended to be consumed off the store 's premises . some states in the united states operate their own retail stores for the sale of certain types of alcohol , such as this state-run liquor store in cottonwood heights , utah . the bunghole , a liquor store in salem , massachusetts , a non-abc state . <hr>while the consumption of alcohol is well known by the medical community as a potential hazard to a fetus , alcohol use during lactation is commonly a gray area for breastfeeding mothers . this article strives to clarify the extent to which a mother can safely use alcohol without adverse effects to her infant . 1 . <hr>rather than getting stored as fat , the main fate of alcohol is conversion into a substance called acetate . in fact , blood levels of acetate after drinking the vodka were 2.5 times higher than normal . and it’s this sharp rise in acetate that puts the brakes on fat loss . 1 a small portion of the alcohol is converted into fat . 2 of the 24 grams of alcohol consumed in this study , roughly 3 % was turned into fat . 3 your liver then converts most of the alcohol into acetate . 4 the acetate is released into your bloodstream and takes precedence over the metabolism of protein , carbohydrate , and fat . <hr>brief description . ethyl alcohol , or ethanol , is an intoxicating ingredient found in beer , wine , and liquor . alcohol is produced by the fermentation of yeast , sugars , and starches . it is a central nervous system depressant that is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine into the bloodstream . <hr>various sources of sugar are used in these processes , resulting in different forms of alcohol . the sugar from crushed grapes is used to make wine ; malted barley is used to make beer ; sugar cane or molasses makes rum ; grain , potatoes , beets , molasses , and a variety of other plants are used to make vodka . the technique used to make the beverage will determine the alcohol content . you will see the percentage of alcohol per volume listed on the bottle , as well as the proof of the drink . the proof of a beverage is twice the alcohol content , so a drink with 12 % alcohol per volume is 24 proof . generally , a 12-ounce glass of beer , a 5-ounce glass of wine , and a 1.5-ounce shot of liquor all contain a ½ ounce of pure alcohol and are considered one drink . continue reading . <hr>how alcohol gets from the blood into the breath . ethanol is volatile and as a result , an amount of alcohol , in proportion to the concentration in the blood , transfers from the blood into the alveolar air sacs in the lungs . this occurs in much the same way that carbon dioxide leaves the alveolar blood and enters the lungs for exhalation from the body . through oxidation in the liver , alcohol is detoxified and removed from the blood , preventing the alcohol from accumulating and destroying cells and organs . a minute amount of alcohol escapes metabolism and is excreted unchanged in the breath , in the sweat and in urine . <hr>when an alcoholic beverage is consumed it passes down the esophagus through the stomach and into the small intestine . although a small amount of alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream through the mucous membrane , the vast majority of alcohol enters the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine . through oxidation in the liver , alcohol is detoxified and removed from the blood , preventing the alcohol from accumulating and destroying cells and organs . a minute amount of alcohol escapes metabolism and is excreted unchanged in the breath , in the sweat and in urine . <hr>alcohol is made by fermenting the sugars from a variety of foods including ( but not limited to ) grain , barley , potatoes , beets , sugar cane , and molasses . alcohol can be used to accompany your meal , as an ingredient in your meal , or by a skilled chef to set your meal on fire ! the shelf life of alcohol depends somewhat on factors such as the sell by date , the preparation method and how the alcohol was stored . you can help alcohol stay fresh longer by storing it in cool , dry and dark place away heat . you can also place your alcohol in a <mark class="reference">refrigerator or freezer</mark> . a home freezer is n't actually cold enough to freeze hard liquor .</td>

<td class="candidate">bioenergy is a form of renewable energy because the energy contained in biomass is energy from the sun captured through natural processes of photosynthesis , and so long as the quantity of biomass used is equal to or less than the amount that can be regrown , it is potentially renewable indefinitely . the majority of biomass for bioenergy comes from three sources : forests , agriculture , and waste ( see figure 1 ) . algaculture is a fourth source currently in development . <hr>biomass energy . biomass is organic material which has stored sunlight in the form of chemical energy . biomass fuels include wood , wood waste , straw , manure , sugar cane , and many other byproducts from a variety of agricultural processes . it can be converted into liquid fuels , for example , or cooked in a process called gasification to produce combustible gases . and certain crops such as switchgrass and willow trees are especially suited as energy crops , plants grown specifically for energy generation . <hr>answer by stovethinker . biomass energy is energy derived from biomass fuels . biomass fuels are organic fuels mainly of <mark class="candidate">plant origin ,</mark> the biomass being formed in living plants by the process of photosynthesis and stored in complex polymers like lignin , cellulose and hemicellulose . the energy derived from stored energy in biomass is called biomass energy .
