This occurs in most cells, but especially in liver cells. The alcohol an adult might consume gets the hydrogens removed and affixed to oxygen cells to create H2O2. Peroxisomes grow by utilizing and taking in proteins and lipids from the cytosol of the cell. Cytosol is basically just the fluid inside a cell. Many other organelles bud off of the endomembrane system but the peroxisomes clearly do not."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome", "passage_text": "A major function of the peroxisome is the breakdown of very long chain fatty acids through beta-oxidation. In animal cells, the long fatty acids are converted to medium chain fatty acids, which are subsequently shuttled to mitochondria where they are eventually broken down to carbon dioxide and water. Peroxisomes contain oxidative enzymes, such as catalase, D-amino acid oxidase, and uric acid oxidase. However the last enzyme is absent in humans, explaining the disease known as gout, caused by the accumulation of uric acid."}, {"url": "https://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080828235403AAtlWDe", "passage_text": "Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: A major function of the peroxisome is the breakdown of fatty acid molecules, in a process called beta-oxidation. In this process, the fatty acids are broken down two carbons at a time, converted to Acetyl-CoA, which is then transported back to the cytosol for further use. In addition, when excess H2O2 accumulates in the cell, catalase converts it to H2O through this reaction. A major function of the peroxisome is the breakdown of fatty acid molecules, in a process called beta-oxidation."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_a_function_of_a_peroxisome", "passage_text": "Peroxisomes are microbodies found in certain cells.
