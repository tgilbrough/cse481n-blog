It is argued that language plays an active role in the development of scientific ideas. A research project is outlined which will investigate this hypothesis and, in addition, focus on such questions as the role of mathematics in science and the status of the genetic code. Such an attitude is an extension of the common presupposition that the essential role of language is to transport a cargo which is variously described as meaning or content. In such a light, scientific writing has, as its objective, the conveying of scientific knowledge to the reader in a clear and economical way."}, {"url": "http://www.fdavidpeat.com/bibliography/essays/lang.htm", "passage_text": "Language and Science. The object of this project, which represents the result of many years of discussion between us, as well as discussions with David Bohm, is to study the role of language in the description and practice of science, in its various disciplinary manifestations.

The formal study of language is often considered to have started in India with P\u0101\u1e47ini, the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology.
