The NOEL in a 3-generation reproduction study with rats was 10 ppm (0.5 mg/kg/day). At 100 ppm (5 mg/kg/day), there were decreased survival of fetuses and decreased maternal and fetal weights (5). It is therefore highly resistant to degradation in the soil environment (7). Decomposition by light occurs slowly, with 15% of the oxyfluorfen applied to a soil surface degrading within 28 days (7). In laboratory studies, its soil half-life was 6 months (7). Its soil half-life in field studies is 30 to 70 days, with much of the loss probably due to volatilization (3, 4, 7"}, {"url": "http://dkt.net.au/msdsfiles/Oxyfluorfen%20240.pdf", "passage_text": "(7) Decontaminate the spill area with detergent and water and rinse.

The largest agricultural markets in terms of total pounds active ingedient are wine grapes and almonds. Much of this increase in treated broccoli and onion acreage was due to the end of production of DCPA (a pre-emergence herbicide). An estimated 12% of cotton acreage in Louisiana was treated with oxyfluorfen in 1992; that estimate increased to 20% of cotton acreage in Louisiana in 1997."}]
