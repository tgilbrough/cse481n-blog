Enter a higher figure to see how much money you can save by paying off your debt faster.

You\u2019ll typically have 10 to 25 years to repay federal loans entirely. Shorter lengths of time or larger loans will result in higher monthly payments. If you have this type of loan, check with your school to find out when you must begin repayment. The grace period on a private student loan depends on the lender and your loan contract. Most private student loans have a short grace period, but you must check with your lender to make sure. You may also choose to consolidate your student loans during the grace period"}, {"url": "http://www.studentfinance.direct.gov.uk/portal/page?_pageid=153,4680136&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL", "passage_text": "Student finance calculator Estimate your student loans, grants and bursaries If you're from England and are thinking of starting a new course at college or university in academic year 2015/16, this calculator will give you an estimate of the financial support you could receive.

One in five senior citizens and almost a quarter of adults between the ages of 35 to 49 agree that $20,000 to $50,000 in student loan debt is too much to borrow. Maybe that's because they are in the age range of folks in a position to hire young people. Maybe it's because college didn't used to cost so much. More than half of all student loans are now delinquent or in deferral, according to a recent study by TransUnion.
