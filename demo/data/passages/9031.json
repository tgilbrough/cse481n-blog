Larger than Mercury and Pluto, and only slightly smaller than Mars, it would easily be classified as a planet if were orbiting the sun rather than Jupiter. Facts about Ganymede. Age: Ganymede is about 4.5 billion years old, about the same age as Jupiter. Distance from Jupiter: Ganymede is the seventh moon and third Galilean satellite outward from Jupiter, orbiting at about 665,000 miles (1.070 million km). It takes Ganymede about seven Earth days to orbit Jupiter. Photos of Ganymede, Jupiter's Largest Moon. Size: Ganymede\u2019s mean radius is 1,635 miles (2,631.2 km). Due to its size, Ganymede can be viewed with the naked eye. Early Chinese astronomical records show the discovery of a moon of Jupiter, mostly likely the first observation of Ganymede"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_(moon)", "passage_text": "Ganymede /\u02c8\u0261aen\u0268mi\u02d0d/ (\u02c8\u0261\u00e6n\u0268mi\u02d0d JUPITER) iii is the largest moon Of jupiter and in The Solar, system and the only moon known to have a.

The Moon's current orbital distance is about thirty times the diameter of Earth, causing it to have an apparent size in the sky almost the same as that of the Sun. This allows the Moon to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipse. This matching of apparent visual size is a coincidence"}, {"url": "http://www.space.com/15257-titan-saturn-largest-moon-facts-discovery-sdcmp.html", "passage_text": "View full size image. Titan is Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in the solar system (after Ganymede of Jupiter). It is the only moon in the solar system with clouds and a dense, planet-like atmosphere. Titan's atmosphere extends about 370 miles high (about 600 kilometers), which makes it a lot higher than Earth's atmosphere. Because the atmosphere is so high, Titan was thought to be the largest moon in the solar system for a long time."}, {"url": "http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/smallest-and-largest-planets-in-our-solar-system/", "passage_text": "In fact, Mercury is closer in size to our Moon than to Earth. The largest planet in our solar system by far is Jupiter, which beats out all the other planets in both mass and volume.

Size, Mass and Orbit: With a mean radius of 2634.1 \u00b1 0.3 kilometers (the equivalent of 0.413 Earths), Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System and is even larger than the planet Mercury. However, with a mass of 1.4819 x 10\u00b2\u00b3 kg (the equivalent of 0.025 Earths), it is only half as massive."}]
