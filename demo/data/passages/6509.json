The recommended maximum time to reheat food is 2 hours. The Food Safety Standards require you to reheat potentially hazardous food that you are going to hold hot e.g. in a bain-marie, rapidly to 60\u00baC or hotter and display or store it at that temperature or hotter.

Most foodborne bacteria and viruses can be killed when food is cooked or reheated long enough at sufficient high temperature. The core temperature of food should reach at least 75\u2103. 1 The thermometer should be properly cleaned and disinfected both before and after use. 2  If it is not available, the food should be reheated until boiling before consumption. 3  For hot-holding, the thoroughly cooked or reheated food should be kept at above 60 \u00b0C to avoid bacterial growth."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_temperature_should_previously_reheated_foods_and_leftover_foods_be_reheated_to", "passage_text": "It depends on what the ingredients are.

The cooling requirement limits the length of time that potentially hazardous food is in the temperature range at which harmful bacteria can grow. Foods particularly important to meet the cooling requirement include soups, sauces, gravies, stews, rice, chili, whole turkeys, turkey breasts and whole roast beef.
