An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is a test that checks for problems with the electrical activity of your heart. An EKG shows the heart 's electrical activity as line tracings on paper. The spikes and dips in the tracings are called waves. The heart is a muscular pump made up of four chambers. An EKG is done to: 1  Check the heart's electrical activity. 2  Find the cause of unexplained chest pain or pressure. 3  Find the cause of symptoms of heart disease. 4  Find out if the walls of the heart chambers are too thick. 5  Check how well medicines are working and see if they are causing side effects that affect the heart. 6  Check how well mechanical 7  ...

Best Answer: An EKG (electrocardiogram) measures the electrical activity of the heart. Leads are placed on various parts of the body (6 on the chest, one on each arm and one on each leg) These leads carry electrical impulses from the heart and translates them onto a continuous strip graph. An EKG measures your heart rate. It tests the electrical waves of your heart. Its tests the valves and chambers to make sure everything is okay. lithdailums7@sbcglobal.net \u00b7 9 years ago."}, {"url": "http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ekg/", "passage_text": "An electrocardiogram (e-lek-tro-KAR-de-o-gram), also called an EKG or ECG, is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity.

The heart is a muscular organ that beats in rhythm to pump the blood through the body. The signals that make the heart's muscle fibres contract come from the sinoatrial node, which is the natural pacemaker of the heart. "}]
