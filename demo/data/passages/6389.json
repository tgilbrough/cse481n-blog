Tit is an old English word meaning little and mase meant small bird. The name titmase morphed eventually into titmouse. This was probably because the bird's coloring does sort of remind people of a small mouse. But actually the meaning of the name Titmouse is small, little bird. Titmice as the plural is the most accepted use even though is not etymologically consistent. I went to Cornell Lab of Ornithology\u2019s Tufted Titmouse webpage at http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Tufted_Titmouse/id and they use titmice repeatedly"}, {"url": "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Titmouse", "passage_text": "2. titmouse. A titmouse is a very small insectivorous bird that come from the family Paridae and are only found in the northen hemisphere and Africa.

The black-crested titmouse, found from central and southern Texas southwards, was included as a subspecies but is now considered a separate species B. atricristatus. Tufted titmice nest in a hole in a tree, either a natural cavity, a man-made nest box, or sometimes an old woodpecker nest. They line the nest with soft materials, sometimes plucking hair from a live animal such as a dog. If they find shed snake skin, they will try to incorporate pieces of it in their nest."}, {"url": "http://www.birdforum.net/showthread.php?t=72419", "passage_text": "Btw, the phrase tufted titmouse is not a proper noun; it is a common noun and requires to be written with initial lower case letters.
