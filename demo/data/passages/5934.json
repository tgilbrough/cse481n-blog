The masseter muscle is a facial muscle that plays a major role in the chewing of solid foods. The muscle is shaped similar to a parallelogram, connecting to the mandible (lower jawbone) and the cheekbone. The masseter is divided into two distinct sections, the superficial and deep portions. The masseter is the key muscle that pulls the mandible upward. All four muscles are connected to a single division of the trigeminal nerve. Because of the sheer bulk of the masseter muscle, portions of it are sometimes removed by plastic surgeons performing jaw reduction surgery."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masseter_muscle", "passage_text": "In human anatomy, the masseter is one of the muscles of mastication. In the animal kingdom, it is particularly powerful in herbivores to facilitate chewing of plant matter. The most obvious muscle of mastication is the masseter muscle, since it is the most superficial and one of the strongest."}, {"url": "http://www.gustrength.com/muscles:masseter-muscle-actions-and-trigger-points", "passage_text": "Posted on 18 Oct 2010 15:27. By Ground Up Strength. The masseter is a jaw muscle that gets its name from the Greek work to chew. It is the major muscle of mastication (chewing) of the human jaw and serves primarily to elevate the mandible (lower jaw) while the deep tissues help to protrude (protract) it forward. In general, masseter trigger points cause pain in the eye, face, jaw, and teeth area. An unexplained earache can be a result of masseter trigger points and it is reported in Travell an Simons that TrPs of the masseter can even cause that annoying itch deep in the ear that you can never quite scratch."}, {"url": "https://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/masseter-muscle", "passage_text": "Anatomy and supply. The masseter muscle is a thick, rectangular muscle of mastication. It consists of a superficial and a deep part, both originating from the zygomatic arch. The masseter is one of the four muscles of the masticatory apparatus. It elevates the mandible causing a powerful jaw closure.
