It contains motor and sensory fibers and, because it passes through the neck and thorax to the abdomen, has the widest distribution in the body.

The vagus nerve is involved in one of the most common causes of fainting, called vasovagal syncope. This is an overreaction of the body to certain stimuli, like the sight of blood, which involves the stimulation of the vagus nerve. This stimulation causes a drop in blood pressure and heart rate. Less blood flows to brain, resulting in loss of consciousness."}, {"url": "http://mentalfloss.com/uk/health/30807/why-the-vagus-nerve-is-so-important", "passage_text": "3.

The vagus is one of the larger more important nerves in the human body. One key role that it plays is as the \u201creset\u201d button to counteract when our alarm system has been set off resulting in the infamous fight, flight or freeze response as some type of threat has been perceived. Also note that the vagus nerve is the \u201cvagabond\u201d nerve that wanders around and surrounds our heart and core area. It is heart-centered and noted as the nerve of intuition and the nerve of compassion. When we feel safe, without threat or anxiety, these abilities and inclinations are free to expand."}, {"url": "http://reset.me/story/the-soothing-vagus-how-our-wandering-nerve-returns-us-to-calm/", "passage_text": "It\u2019s the commander-in-chief of your parasympathetic nervous system.
