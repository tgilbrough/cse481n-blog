Molybdenite, also known as molybdena, is a soft black mineral that was once used to make pencils. The mineral was often confused for graphite and it was thought to contain lead.

It is also used in the petroleum industry, to catalyze the removal of organic sulfur compounds in coal liquification and gas liquification processes.
