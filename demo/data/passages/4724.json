You can assume an up-front cost of about $100-$200 on the cages, water dispensers etc. In this case, you must factor in the cost of the rabbits. I find $2.00 is pretty common in rural areas (about the same as pullets and sold in the same places). Typically, you butcher in 8-12 weeks depending on the breed.
