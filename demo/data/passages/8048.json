One view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe \u2014a dimension independent of events, in which events occur in sequence. Sir Isaac Newton subscribed to this realist view, and hence it is sometimes referred to as Newtonian time.

A sequence of numerical data points in successive order, usually occurring in uniform intervals.
