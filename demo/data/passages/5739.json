Sucrose, glucose and fructose are important carbohydrates, commonly referred to as simple sugars. Sugar is found naturally in whole foods and is often added to processed foods to sweeten them and increase flavor. Simple carbohydrates are classified as either monosaccharides or disaccharides. Monosaccharides are the simplest, most basic units of carbohydrates and are made up of only one sugar unit. Glucose and fructose are monosaccharides and are the building blocks of sucrose, a disaccharide. Thus, disaccharides are just a pair of linked sugar molecules. They are formed when two monosaccharides are joined together and a molecule of water is removed -- a dehydration reaction"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose", "passage_text": "Saccharose is an obsolete name for sugars in general, especially sucrose. The molecule is a disaccharide combination of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose with the formula C12H22O11. Sucrose is often extracted and refined from either cane or beet sugar for human consumption. The word sucrose was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Miller from the French sucre (sugar) and the generic chemical suffix for sugars-ose. The abbreviated term Suc is often used for sucrose in scientific literature."}, {"url": "http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/difference-between-sucrose-glucose-fructose-8704.html", "passage_text": "Sucrose is commonly known as table sugar, and is obtained from sugar cane or sugar beets. Fruits and vegetables also naturally contain sucrose. When sucrose is consumed, the enzyme beta-fructosidase separates sucrose into its individual sugar units of glucose and fructose.
