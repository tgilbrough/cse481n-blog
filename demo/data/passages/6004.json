That\u2019s a start, but for a 2,500-square-foot custom home, even a range of $20 per square foot is a lot of money. You most definitely don\u2019t want your cost estimate on a $250,000 house to be off by $50,000! With a little research, square-foot pricing can be a useful tool to get you \u201cin the ballpark\u201d \u2014 but that\u2019s all. One has a fiberglass tub in the master bath (about $500), and one has a $5,000 whirlpool tub.

The cost per square foot (of finished home) would be $15,000/1400 = $10.71/SF for the smaller home and $15,000/2800 = $5.36 for the larger home. So this is just one example showing how the square foot costs for new construction are effected by many different aspects. I would say around here the average 2000 square foot home that we build (average finishes) runs about $150 a square foot without land. The best way to find out what things cost in your area is to call a few contractors and ask them what their typically square foot costs are. Many things effect the cost of new construction. Local labor rates, local weather conditions, product availability, available labor/trades, fuel prices can all effect the cost.
