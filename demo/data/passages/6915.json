When albumin levels become very low, fluid can leak out from the blood vessels into nearby tissues, causing swelling in the feet and ankles. Very low levels of albumin may indicate liver damage. The normal albumin range is from 3.9 gm/dL to 5.0 gm/dL. ALT and AST are enzymes made in the liver. The normal range of ALT levels is between 5 IU/L (International Units per Liter) and 60 IU/L. The normal range of AST levels is between 5 IU/L and 43 IU/L. Elevated liver enzymes may be a sign of hepatotoxicity (liver toxicity)."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/microalbumin-urine-test?page=2", "passage_text": "Results. An albumin test checks urine for the presence of a protein called albumin. This is called albuminuria. It is most often caused by kidney damage from diabetes.

The detection of low levels of albumin excretion (microalbuminuria) has been linked to the identification of incipient diabetic kidney disease. A ratio of albumin (mcg/L) to creatinine (mg/L) of less than 30 is normal; a ratio of 30-300 signifies microalbuminuria and values above 300 are considered as macroalbuminuria.
