Plant cell nucleus is a double-membrane bound organelle. It controls the activities of the cell and is known as the master mind or the control center of the cell. The plant cell wall has two layers-the outer membrane and the inner membrane, which encloses a tiny space known as perinuclear space. The outer membrane of the nucleus is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The space between these layers is known as the perinuclear space. The nuclear envelope encloses the nucleus and separates the genetic material of the cell from the cytoplasm"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleolus", "passage_text": "The nucleolus is contained within the cell nucleus.

It contains hereditary materials known as chromosomes, acts as a control center for cell activities, and controls cell division. The function of nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle. Nucleus is the control center of the cell. The genes inside the nucleus tell the cell what to do, and thus, tells the body what to do. There are also nucleolus inside th \u2026 e nucleus. Nucleolus makes parts of ribosomes that are sent out to the cytoplasm."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus", "passage_text": "The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome. The function of the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of these genes and to control the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression \u2014the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. In cell biology, the nucleus (pl. nuclei; from Latin nucleus or nuculeus, meaning kernel) is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types have no nuclei, and a few others have many."}, {"url": "http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/nucleus/nucleus.html", "passage_text": "A double-layered membrane, the nuclear envelope, separates the contents of the nucleus from the cellular cytoplasm. The envelope is riddled with holes called nuclear pores that allow specific types and sizes of molecules to pass back and forth between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This organelle has two major functions: it stores the cell's hereditary material, or DNA, and it coordinates the cell's activities, which include growth, intermediary metabolism, protein synthesis, and reproduction (cell division). Only the cells of advanced organisms, known as eukaryotes, have a nucleus."}]
