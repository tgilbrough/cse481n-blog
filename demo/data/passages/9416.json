GraphPad Prism is a program that is intended to be used by medical practitioners such as biologists, pharmacologists and physiologists for the creation of comprehensive nonlinear regression curve fitting, statistics analysis, data organization and scientific graphing. It is also extensively used by medical students. All acquired results using the GraphPad Prism program are linked. When a data entry is modified, the rest follows. This means that the GraphPad Prism updates the graphs, the layout, and the analysis automatically as triggered by any change in entry."}, {"url": "http://file.org/free-download/graphpad-prism", "passage_text": "GraphPad Prism also generates an analysis checklist that can be used during experimentations and in making assumptions.
