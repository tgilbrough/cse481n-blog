My layman\u2019s way of describing Kanban is that it is. 1  a way to organize the chaos that surrounds so many delivery teams by making the need for prioritization and focus clear. 2  a way to uncover workflow and process problems so you may solve them in order to deliver more consistently to your client/customer/etc."}, {"url": "http://www.kaizenworld.com/what-is-kanban.html", "passage_text": "Kanban in its simplest state is a signal linking two or more processes.

Electronic kanban differs from traditional kanban in that it uses technology to replace traditional elements such as kanban cards with barcodes and electronic messages. An example of a simple kanban system implementation is a three-bin system for the supplied parts, where there is no in-house manufacturing. One bin is on the factory floor (the initial demand point), one bin is in the factory store (the inventory control point), and one bin is at the supplier."}, {"url": "http://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kanban.asp", "passage_text": "DEFINITION of 'Kanban '. A specific type of inventory control system. The kanban system is based upon a series of colored cards. These cards denote such factors as quantity, the type of part and the manufacturer. A card is placed in the bin or other container with each group of manufactured items as an identifier for those involved with the next phase of production or distribution. Kanban is a Japanese term meaning signboard or graphic. Cards appear as the container of goods or materials is emptied, allowing the production and delivery of more before a hold-up or shortage develops."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban", "passage_text": "Kanban (\u304b\u3093\u3070\u3093) (literally signboard or billboard in Japanese) is a scheduling system for lean and just-in-time (JIT) production. Kanban is a system to control the logistical chain from a production point of view, and is an inventory control system. Kanban was developed by Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, as a system to improve and maintain a high level of production. An example of a simple kanban system implementation is a three-bin system for the supplied parts, where there is no in-house manufacturing.

Just-in-time is a \u201cpull\u201d system of production, so actual orders provide a signal for when a product should be manufactured. Demand-pull enables a firm to produce only what is required in the correct quantity and at the correct time. Kanban is one of the Lean tools designed to reduce the idle time in a production process. The main idea behind the Kanban system is to deliver what the process needs exactly when it needs it. In Japanese, the word \u201cKan\u201d means visual and ban means card, so Kanban refers to visual cards."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_%28development%29", "passage_text": "This article is about the process management and improvement method. For the lean manufacturing process, see Kanban. Kanban is a method for managing knowledge work with an emphasis on just-in-time delivery while not overloading the team members. In this approach, the process, from definition of a task to its delivery to the customer, is displayed for participants to see. The Kanban method does not prescribe a specific set of roles or process steps. The Kanban method starts with existing roles and processes and stimulates continuous, incremental and evolutionary changes to the system. The Kanban method is a change management method. Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change."}]
