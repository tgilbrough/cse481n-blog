Meningitis can be life-threatening because of the inflammation's proximity to the brain and spinal cord; therefore, the condition is classified as a medical emergency. Some forms of meningitis (such as those associated with meningococci, Haemophilus influenzae type B, pneumococci or mumps virus infections) may be prevented by immunization. In 2013 meningitis resulted in 303,000 deaths \u2013 down from 464,000 deaths in 1990."}, {"url": "http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/encephalitis_meningitis/detail_encephalitis_meningitis.htm", "passage_text": "Meningitis is most often caused by a bacterial or viral infection. It also may be caused by a fungal infection, parasite, a reaction to certain medications or medical treatments, a rheumatologic disease such as lupus, some types of cancer, or a traumatic injury to the head or spine.

Meningitis is either infectious (contagious) or noninfectious. Infectious meningitis is classified as viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic, depending on the type of organism causing the infection. Viral meningitis, also called aseptic meningitis, is the most common type.
