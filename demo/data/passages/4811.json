The plant and animal species that live in each biome have special adaptations that help them survive the conditions of that biome. Many species are endemic to certain biomes, meaning they only exist in that biome and nowhere else. Some species are able to adapt to a wider variety of climatic and geographic influences. Plants and microorganisms grow and reproduce during the short summers when the soil thaws for a brief time. The types of plants that can survive here include shrubs, sedges, mosses, lichens, grasses, and some flowering or herbaceous plants. There are only 48 known species of land mammals that live in the tundra biome."}, {"url": "http://www.ducksters.com/science/ecosystems/marine_biome.php", "passage_text": "There are two major aquatic or water biomes, the marine biome and the freshwater biome.

It covers about 70% of the earth. It includes five main oceans: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, and Southern, as well as many smaller Gulfs and Bays. Marine regions are usually very salty! Marine plants live in the euphotic zone of the ocean because they need energy from the sun for photosynthesis. ANIMALS: The Earth's oceans are home to most of the planet\u2019s biodiversity.

ANIMALS. The marine biome covers three fourths of the earth and there are hundreds of different fish to cover each square foot of it. The main kinds of animals in the sea are whales, dolphins, sharks, and seals which are some of the most popular kinds of sea mammals. Other kinds of animals and fish that live in the sea are the walrus, star fish, eel, crabs, jelly fish, and fresh and salt water fish, but this is just a small list compared to the many different kinds of fish that inhabit the marine biome. In general these fish have about five different adaptations."}]
