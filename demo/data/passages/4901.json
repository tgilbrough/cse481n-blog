(Usually veins carry deoxygenated blood to the heart but the pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood.) There are two unique arteries. The pulmonary artery carries blood from the heart to the lungs, where it receives oxygen. It is unique because the blood in it is not oxygenated, as it has not yet passed through the lungs. The other unique artery is the umbilical artery, which carries deoxygenated blood from a fetus to its mother]."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery", "passage_text": "The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs.
