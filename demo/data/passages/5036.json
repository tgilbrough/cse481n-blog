A hormone similar to bST is produced in all species of animals. In most dairy herds, bST will not be used in cows until they have been in lactation for about 100 days. It will not be used in cows with chronic health or fertility problems. It is expected that bST will be used less in heifers than in adult cows.

Bovine somatotropin or bovine somatotrophin (abbreviated bST and BST), or bovine growth hormone (BGH), is a peptide hormone produced by cows' pituitary gland. Like other hormones, it is produced in small quantities and is used in regulating metabolic processes. After the biotech company Genentech discovered and patented the gene for BST in the 1970s, it became possible to synthesize the hormone using recombinant DNA technology to create recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST), recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), or artificial growth hormone."}]
