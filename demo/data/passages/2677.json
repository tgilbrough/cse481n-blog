DNA ligase is an enzyme that has a very critical role in the process of DNA replication and DNA repair. There are two different things going on when DNA is replicated. Let's revisit this process very briefly. DNA ligase adds on nucleotides in the usual 5' to 3' direction along the DNA strand. In addition to bridging gaps during the process of DNA replication, DNA ligase also works to do the same thing during DNA repair. When DNA is repaired, a portion of the DNA where the error or damage occurred is removed."}, {"url": "http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/DNA+ligase", "passage_text": "DNA ligase, an enzyme that can repair breaks in a strand of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by synthesizing a bond between adjoining nucleotides.
