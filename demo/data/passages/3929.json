Each chromosome consists of a short arm and a long arm, which are joined at the centromere. The paired autosomes of the human genome are numbered in the order of decreasing length, 1 being the longest and 22 the shortest.

A viable DNA coding at a given locus within a gene is called an allele. The ordered list of loci known for a particular genome is called a genetic map. Diploid and polyploid cells whose chromosomes have the same allele at some locus are called homozygous, while those that have different alleles at a locus, heterozygous.

Specific regions that are mapped within a GENOME. Genetic loci are usually identified with a shorthand notation that indicates the chromosome number and the position of a specific band along the P or Q arm of the chromosome where they are found.
