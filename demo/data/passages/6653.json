Answer     It depends but its usually out of your system within 4 weeks.     Answer     HCG levels after a miscarriage, delivery or abort \u2026 ion will decrease by 99% of their previous levels within 2 weeks. When a woman experiences the miscarriage, once the Embryo has been expelled from your system, HCG decreases daily until there is no HCG left in your system. It usually takes about two weeks for HCG to be completely eradicated from your system but it can sometimes take as long as four weeks."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/407996-hcg-levels-after-a-miscarriage/", "passage_text": "During pregnancy, the concentration of hCG typically rises to 25 mIU/mL by the first day of a missed menstrual period, or about 4 weeks from a woman's last menstrual period. By 8 to 10 weeks into a pregnancy, the concentration of hCG in the blood typically peaks at about 100,000 mIU/mL. The week of the pregnancy during which a miscarriage occurs and the corresponding level of hCG in the blood at that time will determine how long it takes hCG levels to return to pre-pregnancy levels."}, {"url": "http://www.medhelp.org/user_journals/show/14504/how-long-does-hcg-stay-in-your-body-after-miscarriage", "passage_text": "9-10 days.

I had a miscarriage, and 2 weeks later ovulated and became pregnant. I read that your HCG levels have to go back down to 0 for you to even ovulate.
