After the installation of certain categories of instruments for example certain types of detectors, there is normally a test caried out to ascertain their integrity, one of these is the &#39;loop&#39; test.

You have a hose pipe (the wires) and a source tap (the power supply). You have a spray gun that regulates the flow (the transducer). You can have other equipment on the line, but it all has to be connected together in a ring Ioop. A big benefit of the current loop is its simple wiring just the two wires. The supply voltage and measuring current are supplied over the same two wires. Zero offset of the base current (ie. 4mA) makes cable break detection simple: if the current suddenly drops to zero, you have a cable break."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_loop", "passage_text": "In electrical signalling an analog current loop is used where a device must be monitored or controlled remotely over a pair of conductors.

In a current loop, the power supply must emit voltage equal to or greater than all the voltage drops in the system combined. The data acquisition device for this example uses a precision shunt resistor to measure current. You need to calculate the voltage drop across the resistor. For the example current loop system, your chosen transducer measures pressure and has an operating voltage of 12 to 30 V. With the transducer selected, properly measuring the current signal is required to provide an accurate representation of the pressure applied to the transducer."}, {"url": "http://www.pacontrol.com/download/4-20mA-Current-Loop-Primer.pdf", "passage_text": "(For example, a thermocouple isa type of sensor which provides a very low-level output voltage that isproportional to its ambient temperature.) The transmitter amplifiesand conditions the sensor\u2019s output, and then converts this voltage toa proportional 4-20mA dc-current that circulates within the closedseries-loop. For example, when a loop-poweredapplication is powered from a 24V power source, the sum of all thevoltage drops around the series loop has to also equal 24V. Everycomponent through which the 4-20mA loop current passes developsa maximum voltage drop equal to that component\u2019s resistancemultiplied by 0.020 Amperes (20mA)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_loop", "passage_text": "A current loop can also be used to control a valve positioner or other output actuator.
