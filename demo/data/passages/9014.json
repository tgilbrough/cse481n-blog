Decreased Opacity (Lucency) Lucency comes in several flavors. Depending on the exact morphology and distribution of the lucency, our differential diagnosis may vary widely.

If bones becomes darker they loss calcium and become more poress (holes with air) and thus, look darker as air or fat looks dark in a Radiograph. Report Abuse. The term lucent or lucency is used to describe a focal area of bony osteopenia--for example, a bone cyst or a lucency (fracture line). This would also be affected by age and gender.
