Laser rangefinders are used extensively in 3-D object recognition, 3-D object modelling, and a wide variety of computer vision-related fields. The more powerful models of rangefinders measure distance up to 25 km and are normally installed either on a tripod or directly on a vehicle or gun platform.

A laser distance meter works by use measuring the time it takes a pulse of laser light to be reflected off a target and returned to the sender. Operating Principle. A laser distance meter emits a pulse of laser at a target. The pulse then reflects off the target and back to the sending device (in this case, a laser distance meter)."}, {"url": "https://www.rp-photonics.com/distance_measurements_with_lasers.html", "passage_text": "1 Triangulation is a geometric method, useful for distances in the range of \u2248\u20091 mm to many kilometers. 2  Time-of-flight measurements (or pulse measurements) are based on measuring the time of flight of a laser pulse from the measurement device to some target and back again. Laser Radar. A laser radar is a device which uses one of the distance measurement techniques as described above, and scans the direction of the distance measurement in two dimensions. This allows the acquisition of an image, or more precisely a depth profile of some object, as required e.g. in robotics."}, {"url": "http://www.lasertech.com/How-Lasers-Work.aspx", "passage_text": "The generated light energy has a wavelength of approximately 900 nanometers, with a beam divergence of 3 milliradians-equal to a beam width of roughly 0.3 m at 100 m or likewise, 3 ft at 1000 ft.
