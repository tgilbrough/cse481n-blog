Light travels as a wave. But unlike sound waves or water waves, it does not need any matter or material to carry its energy along. This means that light can travel through a vacuum\u2014a completely airless space. (Sound, on the other hand, must travel through a solid, a liquid, or a gas.)

An electromagnetic wave travels in a direction that is at right angles to the oscillation direction of both fields.

Rays do not curve around corners, so when they hit an opaque object (one that does not allow light to pass through it), they are blocked from reaching the other side of that object. We see a dark shadow in the area from which light is blocked. But unlike sound waves or water waves, it does not need any matter or material to carry its energy along.

The electric and magnetic fields vibrate at right angles (that is, at angles which measure 90 degrees) to the direction in which the light wave is moving. Light has both the electric field and the magnetic field.

Light waves are a little more complicated than other waves, such as sound waves, water waves, etc. This is because unlike other types of waves, such as sound waves, water wave \u2026 s, etc., light waves do not need a medium to travel through.

Longitudinal waves are waves in which the motion of the individual particles of the medium is in a direction that is parallel to the direction of energy transport."}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_ocr_pre_2011/wave_model/lightandsoundrev1.shtml", "passage_text": "Transverse transverse waves: Waves in which the vibrations happen at right-angles to the direction of travel. Light travels as transverse waves. Longitudinal longitudinal waves: Waves in which the vibrations happen in the same direction as the direction of travel. Sound waves are longitudinal waves.

Sound travels as longitudinal waves and needs to travel through a solid, liquid or gas: it cannot travel through a vacuum. Light and sound can be reflected and refracted, just like water waves."}]
