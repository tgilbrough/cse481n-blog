The outer limits is not as great as the twilight zone but it's still a great scifi classic. I consider the twilight zone the greatest scifi show of all time because of things like twist endings, morals, plots. The outer limits has these things but it just doesn't match the twilight zone. Unlike the twilight zone an outer limits episode is an hour so therefore it'll start off slower but ultimately they'll both challenge your assumptions. Their both great shows I personally like the twilight zone more.
