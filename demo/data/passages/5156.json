Pronounced AL\u00b7do\u00b7ste\u00b7rone. Aldosterone is secreted in response to low salt levels. Aldosterone then activates the MR (for mineralocorticoid receptor) gene. (Aldosterone is classified as a mineralocorticoid hormone.) The product of the MR gene, in turn, stimulates the kidney to reabsorb and retain salt, thereby retaining water.

Aldosterone causes the kidneys to hold onto more sodium, which leads to more water staying in the body. The more fluid the body holds onto, the higher the blood pressure may become.
