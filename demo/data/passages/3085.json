Subscribe to our Digestive Health e-newsletter to stay up to date on digestive health topics. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It causes inflammation of the lining of your digestive tract, which can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition. Inflammation caused by Crohn's disease can involve different areas of the digestive tract in different people. The inflammation caused by Crohn's disease often spreads deep into the layers of affected bowel tissue. Crohn's disease can be both painful and debilitating, and sometimes may lead to life-threatening complications."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/ibd-crohns-disease/ss/slideshow-inflammatory-bowel-overview", "passage_text": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to chronic conditions that cause inflammation in some part of the intestines.
