Exocrine glands are glands that retain ducts to body surfaces. During development, endocrine glands lose their contacts to embryological surfaces(ducts) and become isolated as small blocks of tissues. In exocrine glands, products of these cells collect in the duct of the gland and flow toward the surface to which the duct is in contact. Since endocrine glands lack ducts, the product is released across the cell membrane into interstitial spaces around the cells."}, {"url": "http://mhhe.com/biosci/ap/histology_mh/glands.html", "passage_text": "Modes of Secretion. Secretory cells of exocrine glands release their products into ducts in three different ways. The mode of secretion can be classified as merocrine, apocrine, or holocrine. Cells that secrete products via the merocrine method form membrane-bound secretory vesicles internal to the cell. In exocrine glands, products of these cells collect in the duct of the gland and flow toward the surface to which the duct is in contact. Since endocrine glands lack ducts, the product is released across the cell membrane into interstitial spaces around the cells."}, {"url": "http://www.differencebetween.net/science/health/difference-between-exocrine-and-endocrine/", "passage_text": "Exocrine glands are glands that secrete their products through the ducts, and discharge it into the external environment, to organs or the outside the body. 2. Exocrine hormones are released into the external environment, or outside of the body. Endocrine hormones are released into the internal environment, or inside of the body. 3. Exocrine glands have sub-classifications. 4. Endocrine response is slower because hormones travel through the blood."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocrine_gland", "passage_text": "Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products\u2014 bile and pancreatic juice \u2014into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream.

Exocrine glands usually secrete their products (not hormones or other chemical messengers) into the external environment, while the endocrine glands secrete hormones into the body.
