It functions as a barrier to filtration of large molecules. in normal subjects the capillary endothelium of the glomerulus, by virtue of its fenestration, is permeable to all blood constituents except blood cells and colloids so that the glomerular filtrate has a close similarity to plasma and interstitial fluid but has a lower protein concentration than both of them."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_found_in_filtrate", "passage_text": "The filtrate is the liquid that is left after you filter something -- the liquid that is now missing the solid that was filtered out.
