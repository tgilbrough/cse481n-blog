To calculate the radius based on the circumference, simply divide the circumference by 2\u03c0, or 6.28. 1  For example, if the circumference of a circle is 15, the radius r = 15/2\u03c0, or 2.39. The diameter is the longest line that can be drawn through a circle, and cuts the circle into two equal halves. It is also two times the length of the radius.
