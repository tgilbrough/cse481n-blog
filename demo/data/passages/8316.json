These are produced by cross reactivity with NMDA receptors in the teratoma; these tumours contain many different cell types, including brain cells, and thus present a window in which a breakdown in immunological tolerance can occur. Prior to the development of a symptom complex that is specific to anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, patients may experience prodromal symptoms. These could include headaches, flu-like illness, or symptoms similar to an upper respiratory infection. These symptoms may be present for weeks or months prior to disease onset."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor", "passage_text": "The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (also known as the NMDA receptor or NMDAR), is a glutamate receptor and ion channel protein found in nerve cells. A property of the NMDA receptor is its voltage-dependent activation, a result of ion channel block by extracellular Mg 2+ & Zn 2+ ions. This allows the flow of Na + and small amounts of Ca 2+ ions into the cell and K + out of the cell to be voltage-dependent."}, {"url": "http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0100-879X1997000500001", "passage_text": "NMDA receptors are present in many but not in all neurons of the cerebral cortex. Moriyoshi et al. (8) reported that (NMDAR1)....mRNA is expressed in almost all the neuronal cells throughout the brain regions (p. 36). Since then it has been assumed that virtually all cells express NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors are formed by different subunits belonging to two classes: NMDAR1 (NR1) and NMDAR2 (NR2) (3-7). The first subunit to be characterized, NR1, exhibits the basic features of the NMDA receptor when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (8), and can exist in several isoforms generated by alternative splicing (9)."}, {"url": "http://www.antinmdafoundation.org/the-illness/what-is-anti-nmda-receptor-encephalitis/", "passage_text": "Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is a disease occurring when antibodies produced by the body\u2019s own immune system attack NMDA receptors in the brain.
