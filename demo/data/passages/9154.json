In a free society, religion is an ally of good government as it forms the moral character of individuals and communities. Religious freedom is a fundamental human right that ought to be enjoyed by the people of all nations. This principle has been recognized in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent international agreements. Despite widespread recognition, many people are unable to exercise this basic liberty. While it does not mean that anything and everything done in the name of religious liberty is not subject to the rule of law, it does mean that the law ought to make as much room as possible for the practice of religious faith."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "passage_text": "Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference.

It gives us to believe in Religion X or Religion Y or even Religion ABC without having to worry about being punished by our government for not following the religion it thinks we should follow.

Being that I didn\u2019t have a lot of background information on religion, I chose to do some research on the topic. All of this makes me think that religion is important because people could rely on it when they are feeling down, religion can also help turn a person from doing bad into doing something that will benefit him or herself in the future. 1  Add new comment. 2  Share."}]
