Weather, climate, and natural disasters such as freezes, seasonal changes, hurricanes, and fires are examples.

Both living and non-living things can influence the size of a population of organisms. Some things that happen to populations, such as disease and parasites, depend on the size of the population to be successful at causing destruction. All forms of pollution can act as density-independent factors. Once a pollutant enters the environment, it can have an effect on all organisms living there. It doesn't matter if the populations are large or small-in either scenario, they can be affected negatively by the pollution."}, {"url": "http://www.bgu.ac.il/desert_agriculture/Popecology/PEtexts/PE-F.htm", "passage_text": "In the models used up to now population dynamics were density-independent, as all vital rates of the population and its growth rate were dependent only on the environment, not on density of the population. Density independence is a condition implied in the time-invariance assumption. If, however, any of the vital rates a ij depend also on density of the entire population or of one of its stages (represented by n(t)), then density dependent processes are taking place."}, {"url": "http://warnercnr.colostate.edu/~gwhite/fw662/web_docs/Lecture%201%20Density-independent%20models.pdf", "passage_text": "FW662 Lecture 1 \u2013 Density-independent population models 3 Differential equations for exponential growthContinuous births, deaths, immigration, emigration dNdt \u2019 rN With integration, N t = N 0 e rt where e r = = N 8 t+1 /N t, and hence the nameexponential growth for this model.
