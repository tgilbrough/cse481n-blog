The surface can hold up a weight, and the surface of a water droplet holds the droplet together, in a ball shape. Some small things can float on a surface because of surface tension, even though they normally couldn't float. The cohesive forces among the liquid molecules cause surface tension. In the bulk of the liquid, each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring liquid molecules, resulting in a net force of zero."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_tension", "passage_text": "Surface tension is the elastic tendency of liquids which makes them acquire the least surface area possible.
