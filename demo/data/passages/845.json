The north celestial pole is directly above the earth's north pole and likewise for the south celestial pole. The Celestial Equatorial Coordinate System is based on the concept of the celestial sphere. The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of infinite radius surrounding the earth. Locations of objects in the sky are given by projecting their location onto this infinite sphere."}, {"url": "http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/ike/hookele/celestial_sphere.html", "passage_text": "The Celestial Equator is an imaginary line around the middle of the Celestial Sphere, equidistant from the NCP and SCP and on the same plane as the earth's equator. It intersects the Circle of the Horizon at East and due West. A star 15\u00b0s above the Western horizon on the Celestial Equator will take one hour to reach the Western horizon and set. At the vernal point, the sun is near the constellation of Pisces on the Celestial Sphere. Stars in this constellation have a RA near 0.

The opposite is true if you are in the southern hemisphere. Because the Earth's equator is 90\u00b0 away from the north pole, the celestial equator as seen in Los Angeles will arc up to 90 - 34 = 56 degrees above the southern horizon at the point it crosses the meridian."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_equator", "passage_text": "The celestial equator is defined to be infinitely distant (since it is on the celestial sphere); thus the observer always sees the ends of the semicircle disappear over the horizon exactly due east and due west, regardless of the observer's position on Earth.

The celestial equator is a great circle on the imaginary celestial sphere, in the same plane as the Earth 's equator. In other words, it is a projection of the terrestrial equator out into space. As a result of the Earth's axial tilt, the celestial equator is inclined by 23.4\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic plane.
