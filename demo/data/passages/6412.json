For example, because a full Moon is seen when the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun, an observer on the Earth will see the Moon rise just as the Sun sets. In other words, the amount of the Moon that we can see changes over time in a cyclic period that repeats itself approximately once a month. (The actual period of this cycle is approximately 29.5 Earth days.) The cause of these phases is the relative positions of the Sun, Earth, and Moon."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/The_amount_of_lighted_side_of_the_moon_you_can_see_is_the_same_during", "passage_text": "No. The amount of the Moon visible from the Earth varies, depending on the phase of the Moon.
