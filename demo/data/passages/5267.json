The accurate calculation of calories burned by heart rate requires the heart rate to be between 90 bpm and 150 bpm. In order to obtain an approximation of the number of calories burned, one must also include the weight, gender and duration of exercise. The calories burning have some association with heart rate. After large amount of research and investigation, the Journal of Sports Sciences developed a formula to count for calories burned during exercises."}, {"url": "http://livewell.jillianmichaels.com/estimate-calories-burned-heart-rate-4146.html", "passage_text": "Using your average heart rate during an exercise session, you can estimate the calories that you expend while working out.

A reasonably accurate estimate of calorie expenditure should also consider additional factors such as gender, age and weight. The heart rate can be used to estimate calorie expenditure during exercise. This is because the relationship between heart rate and calorie expenditure is relatively linear so long as the heart rate is between 90 and 150 beats per minute (bpm)."}, {"url": "http://www.calculatorpro.com/calculator/calories-burned-by-heart-rate/", "passage_text": "When that same person increases her heart rate to 75, here is what the calculator returns: \u201cYou burned roughly 2 calories per minute for a total of 57 calories.\u201d.
