Whilst most volcanic activity happens at plate margins, there are cases of volcanoes erupting in the middle of plates.

Follow site author @kenrubin on Twitter. The Hawaiian Islands are volcanic in origin. Each island is made up of at least one primary volcano, although many islands are composites of more than one. The Big Island, for instance, is constructed of 5 major volcanoes: Kilauea, Mauna Loa, Mauna Kea, Hualalai and Kohala. These other types of volcanoes (common outside of Hawaii) are typically steeper sided. The Hawaiian volcanoes were produced by the Hawaiian hot spot, which is presently under the Big Island of Hawaii.
