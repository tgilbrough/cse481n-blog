Under normal circumstances, blood volume remains constant at 5,000 mL. A blood pressure with a systolic of 140 mm Hg or higher or a diastolic pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher is considered high, although for patients with certain chronic conditions, like coronary artery disease, the guidelines vary."}, {"url": "http://www.atitesting.com/ati_next_gen/skillsmodules/content/vital-signs/equipment/bldpressure.html", "passage_text": "When documenting blood pressure, record the systolic number first, followed by a slash and the diastolic number, as in 120/80. The difference between the systolic and diastolic values is called the pulse pressure. This number is usually between 30 and 50 mm Hg and provides information about a patient\u2019s cardiac function and blood volume. How often you measure blood pressure varies from patient to patient.
