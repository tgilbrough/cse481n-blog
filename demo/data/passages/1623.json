Density: We determine a planet's makeup primarily by learning its density. For example, Earth's density is about 5.5 times water's density. So, if we learn that a new planet has about the same density as Earth's, we might guess it is similar to Earth. A: Scientists determine a planet's ingredients in several ways, depending partly on how close it is to Earth. Planets within our solar system: For planets like Mars that robots have visited, we analyzed rock and atmospheric samples on the spot. We also measure the planet's magnetic properties."}, {"url": "http://www.universetoday.com/85749/is-the-moon-a-planet/", "passage_text": "\u201cA planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.\u201d. According to the geophysical planet definition, what makes a planet a planet is that it is a non-self-luminous celestial spheroidal body orbiting a star, free floating in space, or even orbiting another planet. In other words, what makes a planet a planet are its intrinsic characteristics. If an object is not a star and is large enough for its gravity to squeeze it into a round or nearly round shape, it is a planet.

A planet is a celestial body that (a) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (b) is in orbit around a star, and is neither a star nor a satellite of a planet.

A: A dwarf planet is an object in orbit around the Sun that is large enough (massive enough) to have its own gravity pull itself into a round (or nearly round) shape. Generally, a dwarf planet is smaller than Mercury.
