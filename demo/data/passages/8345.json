There are two types of respiratory alkalosis: chronic and acute as a result of the 3-5 day delay in kidney compensation of the abnormality. 1  Acute respiratory alkalosis occurs rapidly. 2  For every 10 mmHg drop in PCO2 in arterial blood, there is a corresponding 2 mEq/L drop in bicarbonate ion due to acute compensation."}, {"url": "http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/vander/student/olc/u-reading1.html", "passage_text": "Acidosis and alkalosis are categorized by the cause of the condition. Respiratory acidosis or respiratory alkalosis results from abnormalities of the respiratory system.

"}, {"url": "http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/301680-overview", "passage_text": "Background. Respiratory alkalosis is a disturbance in acid and base balance due to alveolar hyperventilation. Alveolar hyperventilation leads to a decreased partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2). Respiratory alkalosis can be acute or chronic. In acute respiratory alkalosis, the PaCO 2 level is below the lower limit of normal and the serum pH is alkalemic. In chronic respiratory alkalosis, the PaCO 2 level is below the lower limit of normal, but the pH level is relatively normal or near normal."}, {"url": "http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/respiratory+alkalosis", "passage_text": "The primary cause of respiratory alkalosis is hyperventilation. This rapid, deep breathing can be caused by conditions related to the lungs like pneumonia, lung disease, or asthma. More commonly, hyperventilation is associated with anxiety, fever, drug overdose, carbon monoxide poisoning, or serious infections. In compensated alkalosis pH may be normal, with a low blood bicarbonate concentration (due to increased renal excretion) when the cause is respiratory, or with a raised blood carbon dioxide (due to hypoventilation) when the cause is metabolic."}, {"url": "http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/respiratory+alkalosis", "passage_text": "Hyperventilation, the primary cause of respiratory alkalosis, is also the primary symptom. This symptom is accompanied by dizziness, light headedness, agitation, and tingling or numbing around the mouth and in the fingers and hands. Muscle twitching, spasms, and weakness may be noted. In compensated alkalosis pH may be normal, with a low blood bicarbonate concentration (due to increased renal excretion) when the cause is respiratory, or with a raised blood carbon dioxide (due to hypoventilation) when the cause is metabolic."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_alkalosis", "passage_text": "Signs and symptoms of respiratory alkalosis are related to the decreased blood carbon dioxide levels, and include peripheral paraesthesia. In addition, the alkalosis may disrupt calcium ion balance, and cause the symptoms of hypocalcaemia (such as tetany and fainting) with no fall in total serum calcium levels. However, chronic respiratory alkalosis leads to hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia, by inducing renal PTH-resistance. There are two types of respiratory alkalosis: chronic and acute as a result of the 3-5 day delay in kidney compensation of the abnormality. 1  Acute respiratory alkalosis occurs rapidly. 2  For every 10 mmHg drop in PCO2 in arterial blood, there is a corresponding 2 mEq/L drop in bicarbonate ion due to acute compensation."}, {"url": "http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/r/respiratory_alkalosis/intro.htm", "passage_text": "Respiratory alkalosis: Introduction. Respiratory alkalosis: An acid-base imbalance disorder involving the blood gases. It is characterized by decreased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood and is caused by an increase in the breathing rate or volume. The severity of symptoms is determined by the degree of imbalance. "}, {"url": "http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/respiratory+alkalosis", "passage_text": "Respiratory alkalosis is a condition where the amount of carbon dioxide found in the blood drops to a level below normal range. This condition produces a shift in the body's pH balance and causes the body's system to become more alkaline (basic). In compensated alkalosis pH may be normal, with a low blood bicarbonate concentration (due to increased renal excretion) when the cause is respiratory, or with a raised blood carbon dioxide (due to hypoventilation) when the cause is metabolic."}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/respiratory-alkalosis", "passage_text": "Normally, these two gases are kept in balance by the respiratory system. Respiratory alkalosis occurs when carbon dioxide levels drop too low. This causes the pH of the blood to rise and become too alkaline. This condition is basically the opposite of respiratory acidosis, when the blood becomes too acidic. Treating the condition is a matter of raising carbon dioxide levels in the blood. The following strategies and tips are useful for respiratory alkalosis caused by overbreathing due to panic and anxiety: 1  Breathe into a paper bag. 2  This is a very simple strategy. 3  It can also be very effective."}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/alkalosis/overview.html", "passage_text": "Back to Top Causes. The kidneys and lungs maintain the proper balance of chemicals, called acids and bases, in the body. Decreased carbon dioxide (an acid) or increased bicarbonate (a base) levels make the body too alkaline, a condition called alkalosis. Respiratory alkalosis is caused by low carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This can be due to: 1  Fever. 2  Being at a high altitude. 3  Lack of oxygen. 4  Liver disease."}]
