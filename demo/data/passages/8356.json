Hydropower plants range from very small to very large individual plants and vast integrated schemes involving multiple large hydropower plants. "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower", "passage_text": "Hydropower or water power (from the Greek: \u03cd\u03b4\u03c1\u03c9, water) is power derived from the energy of falling water or fast running water, which may be harnessed for useful purposes. A trompe, which produces compressed air from falling water, is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance. In the late 19th century, hydropower became a source for generating electricity. Cragside in Northumberland was the first house powered by hydroelectricity in 1878 and the first commercial hydroelectric power plant was built at Niagara Falls in 1879"}, {"url": "http://www.c2es.org/technology/factsheet/hydropower", "passage_text": "Hydropower, or hydroelectricity, is electricity generated by the force of moving water in the penstock [8] of a hydropower unit. Turbines are used to capture the kinetic energy of water by converting it to electricity as the falling water spins the turbine. Quick Facts. 1  Hydropower is a renewable, efficient, and reliable source of energy that does not directly emit greenhouse gases or other air pollutants, and that can be scheduled to produce power as needed, depending on water availability."}, {"url": "https://www.originenergy.com.au/blog/about-energy/what-is-hydropower.html", "passage_text": "One turns to the other and says \u201cdam!\u201d... It may be a particularly bad joke, but it does have something to do with this post. Hydropower (or hydroenergy) is a form of renewable energy that uses the water stored in dams, as well as flowing in rivers to create electricity in hydropower plants. "}, {"url": "http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/hydropower-profile/", "passage_text": "Hydropower is electricity generated using the energy of moving water. Rain or melted snow, usually originating in hills and mountains, create streams and rivers that eventually run to the ocean. The energy of that moving water can be substantial, as anyone who has been whitewater rafting knows. Hydropower is also readily available; engineers can control the flow of water through the turbines to produce electricity on demand. In addition, reservoirs may offer recreational opportunities, such as swimming and boating."}, {"url": "http://energy.gov/eere/water/how-hydropower-works", "passage_text": "How Hydropower Works. Hydropower is using water to power machinery or make electricity. Water constantly moves through a vast global cycle, evaporating from lakes and oceans, forming clouds, precipitating as rain or snow, then flowing back down to the ocean. Turbines and generators convert the energy into electricity, which is then fed into the electrical grid to be used in homes, businesses, and by industry. To see a close up view of how the generator of a water turbine works, see the Hydropower Basics page."}, {"url": "http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/hydropower/tech.html", "passage_text": "Flowing water creates energy that can be captured and turned into electricity. This is called hydroelectric power or hydropower. The most common type of hydroelectric power plant uses a dam on a river to store water in a reservoir. Water released from the reservoir flows through a turbine, spinning it, which in turn activates a generator to produce electricity. But hydroelectric power doesn't necessarily require a large dam. "}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/info_8419828_uses-hydropower-energy.html", "passage_text": "A primary use of hydropower energy is to produce electricity. The main ingredients of hydroelectric power plants are dams, rivers and turbines. Plants use dams to create reservoirs where the water is stored. This water is then released through turbines and spun to activate generators and create electricity. Save. David Hecker/Getty Images News/Getty Images. Hydropower is energy collected from flowing water that's converted into electricity or used to power machinery. The ancient Greeks used water wheels for grinding wheat into flour, and by the 1700s, water turbines were employed to harness the energy of flowing water."}]
