To communicate is to express a certain attitude, and the type of speech act being performed corresponds to the type of attitude being expressed. For example, a statement expresses a belief, a request expresses a desire, and an apology expresses a regret. As an act of communication, a speech act succeeds if the audience identifies, in accordance with the speaker's intention, the attitude being expressed. Some speech acts, however, are not primarily acts of communication and have the function not of communicating but of affecting institutional states of affairs."}, {"url": "http://www.uniroma2.it/didattica/ling_ing1_linfo/deposito/SPEECH_ACTS.doc", "passage_text": "In general, speech acts are acts of communication.
