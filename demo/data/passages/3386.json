In many cases, extremophile archaea have developed mechanisms relating to their cell membranes to protect them from hostile environments. -- but they can also illuminate some of the important differences between extremophiles and other organisms. Before we look at a few of the environments extremophiles favor, here's a list of some additional names used to classify specific types of extremophiles: 1  Acidophile: likes acidic environments (low pH)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile", "passage_text": "Most known extremophiles are microbes. The domain Archaea contains renowned examples, but extremophiles are present in numerous and diverse genetic lineages of bacteria and archaeans. Furthermore, it is erroneous to use the term extremophile to encompass all archaeans, as some are mesophilic. New sub-types of-philes are identified frequently and the sub-category list for extremophiles is always growing. For example, microbial life lives in the liquid asphalt lake, Pitch Lake.
