Assistive technology is an umbrella term that includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities and also includes the process used in selecting, locating, and using them. Assistive technology for cognition (ATC) is the use of technology (usually high tech) to augment and assistive cognitive processes such as attention, memory, self-regulation, navigation, emotion recognition and management, planning, and sequencing activity."}, {"url": "http://slideplayer.com/slide/4432512/", "passage_text": "Bioengineering is the application of engineering (technology) to living things, such as humans and plants.
