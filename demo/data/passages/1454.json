They are caused by the fragmentation of gassy magma, and are usually associated with very viscous magmas (dacite and rhyolite). Here are some of the most common types of eruptions: In a Hawaiian eruption, fluid basaltic lava is thrown into the air in jets from a vent or line of vents (a fissure) at the summit or on the flank of a volcano.

Explosive eruptions are characterized by gas-driven explosions that propels magma and tephra. Effusive eruptions, meanwhile, are characterized by the outpouring of lava without significant explosive eruption. Flows from Hawaiian eruptions are basaltic, and can be divided into two types by their structural characteristics. Pahoehoe lava is a relatively smooth lava flow that can be billowy or ropey. They can move as one sheet, by the advancement of toes, or as a snaking lava column."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions", "passage_text": "Several types of volcanic eruptions \u2014during which lava, tephra (ash, lapilli, volcanic bombs and blocks), and assorted gases are expelled from a volcanic vent or fissure \u2014have been distinguished by volcanologists.

The separating plates create vents on the ocean floor where lava flows out forming a rift volcano."}, {"url": "http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/eruption-styles", "passage_text": "Image courtesy of USGS.
