Hardness numbers have no units and are commonly given in the R, L, M, E and K scales. The higher the number in each of the scales means the harder the material. For instance, the progression from calcite to fluorite (from 3 to 4 on the Mohs scale) reflects an increase in hardness of approximately 25 percent; the progression from corundum to diamond, on the other hand (9 to 10 on the Mohs scale), reflects a hardness increase of more than 300 percent."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_unit_of_hardness", "passage_text": "The scale of mineral hardness is referred to as the Mohs scale.

The hardness number can be converted into units of pascals, but should not be confused with pressure, which also has units of pascals. The hardness number is determined by the load over the surface area of the indentation and not the area normal to the force, and is therefore not pressure. Vickers hardness numbers are reported as xxxHVyy, e.g. 440HV30, or xxxHVyy/zz if duration of force differs from 10 s to 15 s, e.g. 440Hv30/20, where: 1  440 is the hardness number, 2  HV gives the hardness scale (Vickers), 3  30 indicates the load used in kgf."}, {"url": "http://www.calce.umd.edu/TSFA/Hardness_ad_.htm", "passage_text": "ASTM E-10 is a standard test for determining the Brinell hardness of metallic materials.
