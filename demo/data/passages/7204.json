As with many scientific inventions, it's hard to pinpoint the first person to invent an anemometer. Sometimes the first inventor doesn't produce the best instrument, and improvements made by later scientists significantly enhance accuracy and ease of use. Cup Anemometer. A more advanced anemometer design using four cups attached by spokes to a central rod was invented by John Thomas Romney Robinson in 1846. Robinson was the director of the Armagh Observatory in Ireland. With his design, cups caught the wind and spun around faster the stronger the wind velocity."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Who_invented_the_anemometer_and_when", "passage_text": "Making the world better, one answer at a time.

Credited with devising the first mechanical anemometer is Italian art architect and mathematician Leon Batista Alberti, in 1450.

Wind speed is measured by a device called an anemometer, which comes from the Greek word for wind \u201canemos\u201d. Italian art architect, mathematician and renaissance man Leon Battista Alberti invented the first mechanical anemometer in 1450. His instrument consisted of a disk placed perpendicular to the wind. Englishman Robert Hooke re-invented the anemometer in 1664 and often is mistakenly credited as its first inventor. In 1846, Irish researcher John Thomas Romney Robinson invented the hemispherical cup anemometer which is still used today.
