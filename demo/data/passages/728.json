The nitrogenous bases found in DNA are adenine (A), thymine (T \u2026), cytosine (C) and guanine (G). 1 person found this useful."}, {"url": "http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/dnarep/structure.html", "passage_text": "The nucleotide in DNA consists of a sugar (deoxyribose), one of four bases (cytosine (C), thymine (T), adenine (A), guanine (G)), and a phosphate. Cytosine and thymine are pyrimidine bases, while adenine and guanine are purine bases. The sugar and the base together are called a nucleoside."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_makes_up_a_nucleotide_of_DNA", "passage_text": "A DNA nucleotide is one of two kinds of bases... a pyrimidine or a purine. The purine is a heterocyclic (two-ring) molecule with a 5 member and 6 member ring each containing 2 \u2026 Nitrogens. Purines are just a single ring with 2"}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_makes_up_a_nucleotide_of_DNA", "passage_text": "There are four nucleotides that make up DNA: Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine. There are billions of them that make up one strand of DNA. Adenine always pairs with Thymi \u2026 ne and Guanine always pairs with Cytosine. Also, in the Rna during DNA transcription, Uracil replaces Thymine and pairs with Adenine instead."}, {"url": "http://chemistry.about.com/od/dnarna/f/What-Are-The-3-Parts-Of-A-Nucleotide-How-Are-They-Connected.htm", "passage_text": "Answer: Both deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are made up of nucleotides which consist of three parts: 1  Nitrogenous Base. 2  Purines and pyrimidines are the two categories of nitrogenous bases. 3  Pentose Sugar. 4  In DNA, the sugar is 2'-deoxyribose. 5  Phosphate Group. 6  A single phosphate group is PO 4 3- ."}, {"url": "http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistryglossary/g/Nucleotide-Definition.htm", "passage_text": "Nucleotide Definition: A nucleotide is an organic molecule made up of a nucleotide base, a five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose) and at least one phosphate group. Nucleotides make up the basic units of DNA and RNA molecules."}]
