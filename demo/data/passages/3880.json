Lumens are actually dimensionless, so the lumen output of the projector is static and has nothing to do with the size of the image.

The brighter the projector, the higher the ANSI lumen rating, and (all else being equal) the more it costs. In today's market, projectors can be grouped by ANSI lumen output as follows: 1  Less than 2000 lumens. 2  Typically small and highly portable, these are the lowest light output projectors available today, and they are typically the least expensive."}, {"url": "http://www.projectorlampcenter.com/SearchResults.asp?Cat=100", "passage_text": "Most Home Theater Projectors have Lumens Ratings that average between 1000-1300 Lumens. Home Theater Projectors are typically used in a darker, light-controlled setting, therefore less lumens is required. In the board room, a Projector might have a Lumens Rating between 2000-3000 Lumens. For example, a 100 watt light bulb produces roughly 1200 Lumens.

A measurement of light that has been standardized by ANSI. It is commonly used to rate the brightness of a data projector. An ANSI lumen rating uses an average of several measurements taken across the face of the light source. A small room typically requires from 200 to 300 ANSI lumens, whereas a large room may require from 400 to 600. A large auditorium may need 2000 or more"}, {"url": "http://www.alectrosystems.com/video/projection/projector_specs.htm", "passage_text": "Keep in mind that when comparing lumens you are dealing with ratios. For example, an 3000 lumen projector will look 50% brighter than a 1500 lumen projector. A 5000 lumen projector will only look 30% brighter than a 3500 lumen projector, even though there is a difference of 1500 lumens in both cases. Contrast Ratio works hand in hand with lumens. A projector with a 1000:1 contrast ratio will look brighter than one with 400:1, even though they have the same lumen rating.
