One of the largest factors in the cost of your sprinkler system is the size of your property. The more pipe that needs to be laid and the more sprinkler heads that you need will make the price of your system rise. However, the price does not go up proportionally. That is to say the cost of a sprinkler system for a property that is twice the size of another is not necessarily twice the price. This is because sprinkler systems run in zones.
