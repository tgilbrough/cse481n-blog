We assumed that a 25-year-old who earns $40,000 today would save 15 percent of his salary every year for the next 40 years. His salary would grow annually by the rate of inflation.

Adults closer to that age are naturally less likely to think they will be ready for retirement by that point. WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The average age at which U.S. retirees report retiring is 62, the highest Gallup has found since first asking Americans this question in 1991.

One of the greatest advantages a young investor has is time. Investing legend Peter Lynch, who saw average annual returns of 29% during his tenure managing Fidelity's Magellan fund from 1977 to 1990, encourages all investors to start investing young by saving money in a retirement account. If you start by investing $1,200 in the stock market every year and gain an average of 9% annually -- the stock market's historical average annual return -- your portfolio would grow to a total of $121,136 after 25 years."}, {"url": "http://www.investopedia.com/articles/younginvestors/09/common-mistakes-young-investors.asp", "passage_text": "5. Not Investing As mentioned earlier, an investor has the best ability to seek a higher return and take on higher risk when they have a long-term time horizon. Investors have their longest time horizons, and therefore a high tolerance for risk, when they are young. Perhaps the investor rightly develops an opinion that an asset priced at $25 should be worth $50. If it moves up to $50 before he or she buys it, the investor may artificially revise the price target to $60 in order to rationalize the purchase. 2.

So if you\u2019re 20, you would invest 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds. If you\u2019re 60, you would invest 40 percent in stocks and 60 percent in bonds. This formula is an oversimplification, but I like it because it gives you the idea of how your asset allocation should change as you age. Some young, aggressive investors will want to invest in 90 or even 100 percent stocks whereas many conservative investors will never own 70 percent stocks at age 30, and that\u2019s OK. "}]
