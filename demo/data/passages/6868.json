Dappled willows are deciduous shrubs that grow 4 to 6 feet in height and width with judicious pruning or 15 to 20 feet when allowed to grow into trees. Propagation. Dappled willows, like the rest of the willow family, are simple to propagate. During the spring, cut 8-inch lengths of softwood stems with no leaves; in the winter, do the same with hardwood samples."}, {"url": "http://growingthehomegarden.com/2008/06/visiting-mother-plant-japanese-dappled.html", "passage_text": "Several weeks ago I wrote a post about one of my favorite shrubs, the Japanese Dappled Willow 'Hakuro Nishiki' (Salix integra) .

Best color is produced in full sun. But in zones with hotter summers, the dappled willow will not tolerate prolonged heat. It is best to plant in part sun or part shade and water weekly where summers are long, hot and dry. They can grow several feet per year and will usually spread equal to their height (a mature \u2018Hakuro Nishiki\u2019 may reach about 10 feet).

Dappled willow is one of the more than 300 species in the willow family. It has several other names, including Hakuro-nishiki, Albo-maculata, Dappled Japanese Willow and Variegated willow. This dwarf willow is a shrub and difficult to train to tree shape. Gardeners plant the dappled willow because of its beautiful colors. It starts to grow earlier in the spring than other plants, beginning with yellow catkins which appear on the plant in April. The foliage will start out as pink in the spring and then turn to green and creamy white for the summer."}, {"url": "http://www.midwestgardentips.com/hakuro-nishiki_dappled_willow.html", "passage_text": "Willow roots in general grow very fast, just like the willow plant.

It is a small-growing, deciduous tree that is usually grown as a shrub since it only grows to between 8 and 10 feet in height. The dappled willow has striking variegated, white-green foliage that is sometimes tinged with pink. If you are planting a bare-root dappled willow tree, spread out its roots in all directions. If you are planting a container-grown dappled willow tree, loosen the root system with your fingers if there are any bound or matted roots present. Scoop in garden soil to fill the planting hole about 2/3 full of soil."}]
