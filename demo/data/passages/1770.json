Report Abuse. I would put it in at 375 degrees for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours depending how you like it and the strength of your oven. It helps if you cover it with aluminum foil and every 30 minutes go in and with a baster take the juices and pour it over the pork roast so it doesn't dry out.

The internal temperature of the pork roast should between 145 and 160 degrees. Do not overcook the pork, it will become dry. Also make sure you allow the pork loin roast for about 10 minutes before serving. There is no need to cover the roast with foil or a lid while it is cooking; this is a dry roasting technique. One of my favorite ways to cook a pork loin is with garlic and rosemary. You can make one of these in the oven; it is practically fool-proof. This recipe only requires a 4 to 5 pound pork loin, kosher salt, some fresh rosemary and garlic."}]
