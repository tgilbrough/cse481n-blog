Prediabetes, is a serious chronic health condition that can increase your chances of developing diabetes, as well as other chronic diseases. In prediabetes, high blood sugar levels are caused by insulin resistance, whereby the cells of the body are unable to use insulin correctly. Insulin resistance is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome, which can increase the risk for cardiovascular disease.

Understanding a prediabetes diagnosis is the first step to taking control of your risk for diabetes and making life choices that can reverse it."}, {"url": "http://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/pre-diabetes/pre-diabetes", "passage_text": "Prediabetes is a \u201cpre-diagnosis\u201d of diabetes\u2014you can think of it as a warning sign.
