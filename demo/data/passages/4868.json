Experts disagree, though, on just how bad of an effect high triglyceride levels by themselves have on the heart. Your total cholesterol level is in the Desirable range, but your level of bad LDL cholesterol is High. This may mean that your level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good cholesterol, is too low.
