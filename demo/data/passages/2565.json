Since the last ice age, around 11,000 years ago, the Earth s climate has remained relatively stable, with global temperatures averaging at about 14 C. However, in the last century climate has started to change rapidly as the Earth's temperature has increased by approximately 0.7\u00b0C."}, {"url": "http://climate-and-freshwater.info/climate_change/", "passage_text": "There are many factors that can cause a warming of our climate; for example, more energy from the sun, large natural events such as El Nino or an increased greenhouse effect.
