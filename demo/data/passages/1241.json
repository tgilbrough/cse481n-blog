Ghee residue is produced in large quantity by dairy industries and most of the ghee residue goes to waste [4] , which can be. used as a substrate for large scale production of lipase enzyme. Also the production cost reduced for the lipase would be enzyme, whichfinds applications in wide range of industries.
