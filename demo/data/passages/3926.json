Various super-resolution microscope designs that are capable of much higher resolution can also be used.

Immunofluorescence is a common technique using a fluorescence microscope in labs/institutions that perform biological studies, as it allows scientists to easily identify and differentiate between the antibodies and antigens present in a tissue sample. Purpose. The reason scientists use immunofluorescence in lab studies is because it uses fluorescent dyes that attract and bind to specific antibodies made by the immune system when it is under attack by a particular antigen."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence", "passage_text": "Immunofluorescence is a technique used for light microscopy with a fluorescence microscope and is used primarily on microbiological samples.
