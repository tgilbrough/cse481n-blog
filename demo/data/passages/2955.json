Ragas and its features. Ragam is a huge part of Carnatic music which means a particular combination of notes (or svaras) which are pleasant to listen to. Thus different combinations of svaras make different ragas of which each has a unique identity. One of the aims of learning Carnatic Music is to achieve Raga Gnanam. Any raga that does not belong to the melakarta system is a janya raga. Janya ragas are characterized by missing notes in the arohanam and/or avarohanam (eg. Sa-Ri-Ga-Pa-Da-Sa), the use of twisted progressions (eg. Sa-Ga-Ri-Ma-Pa-Da-Ni-Sa) etc. Janya ragas and their classifications will be described subsequently."}, {"url": "http://www.angelfire.com/musicals/kallidaihari/important_ragas.htm", "passage_text": "Suitable to sing at all times, particularly, the first yamam (dawn).
