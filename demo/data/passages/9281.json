[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate", "passage_text": "ATP transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism. It is one of the end products of photophosphorylation, cellular respiration, and fermentation and used by enzymes and structural proteins in many cellular processes, including biosynthetic reactions, motility, and cell division. ATP is an unstable molecule in unbuffered water, in which it hydrolyses to ADP and phosphate. This is because the strength of the bonds between the phosphate groups in ATP is less than the strength of the hydrogen bonds (hydration bonds), between its products (ADP + phosphate), and water."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Is_cellular_respiration_a_hydrolysis_reaction", "passage_text": "Respiration is a catabolic reaction-it breaks down a complex molecule (glucose) and forms simpler molecules (carbon dioxide and water).

The hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphoric acid (Pi) releases energy (it is an exergonic reaction). Some chemical reactions that occur in cells require energy. Hydrolysis reactions of ATP can provide this energy. Aerobic respiration is a series of enzyme-controlled reactions that release the energy stored up in carbohydrates and lipids during photosynthesis and make it available to living organisms. Aerobic respiration. There are four stages: glycolysis, the link reaction, the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation."}]
