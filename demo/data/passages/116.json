[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_pressure", "passage_text": "Pulse pressure is the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressure readings. It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). It represents the force that the heart generates each time it contracts.

A pulse pressure lower than 40 may mean you have poor heart function, while a higher pulse pressure may mean your heart's valves are leaky (valve regurgitation). The most important cause of elevated pulse pressure is stiffness of the aorta, the largest artery in the body. The stiffness may be due to high blood pressure or fatty deposits on the walls of the arteries (atherosclerosis). The greater your pulse pressure, the stiffer and more damaged the vessels are thought to be. A high pulse pressure may be a strong predictor of heart problems and, especially for older adults, if your pulse pressure is greater than 60 it is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/pulse-measurement?page=3", "passage_text": "The chart below shows the normal range of a resting heart rate (pulse rate after resting 10 minutes) in beats per minute, according to age.

Normal blood pressure is a systolic pressure of less than 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and a diastolic pressure of less than 80 mm Hg, or 120/80 mm Hg, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Having a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg is considered high blood pressure or hypertension. A blood pressure level between normal and hypertension, is called prehypertension, meaning it is higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered hypertension."}, {"url": "http://www.healthcentral.com/high-blood-pressure/c/58370/110775/pulse", "passage_text": "Pulse pressure refers to the difference between the systolic (top) and diastolic (bottom) blood pressure.
