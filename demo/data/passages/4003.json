The additional chromosome usually occurs before conception. It is the second-most common autosomal trisomy, after Down syndrome, that carries to term. Edwards syndrome occurs in around one in 6,000 live births, and around 80% of those affected are female. The majority of fetuses with the syndrome die before birth.
