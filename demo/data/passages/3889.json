The matrix is secreted by cells called osteocytes. It consists mostly of mineralized collagen fibres arranged in lamellae. What little ground substance is present is also mineralized. Connective tissue is the most diverse of the four tissue types with a wide variety of functions. It ranges in consistency from the gel-like softness of areolar connective tissue to the hardness of bone.

Features to Know: the liquid matrix is called the plasma. The numerous round, red cells are erythrocytes (or red blood cells) that lack nuclei (the center of the cell is depressed and thus may appear lighter colored)."}, {"url": "http://www.training.seer.cancer.gov/leukemia/anatomy/composition.html", "passage_text": "Composition of the Blood. When a sample of blood is spun in a centrifuge, the cells and cell fragments are separated from the liquid intercellular matrix. Because the formed elements are heavier than the liquid matrix, they are packed in the bottom of the tube by the centrifugal force. The light yellow colored liquid on the top is the plasma, which accounts for about 55 percent of the blood volume and red blood cells is called the hematocrit ,or packed cell volume (PCV). The white blood cells and platelets form a thin white layer, called the buffy coat, between plasma and red blood cells."}, {"url": "http://courseweb.edteched.uottawa.ca/medicine-histology/English/SS_BasicTissues/Connective_Tissue.htm", "passage_text": "Connective Tissue A really diverse group of tissues: Connective tissue is the most diverse of the four tissue types with a wide variety of functions.

All of the kinds of blood cells (red, white, and platelets) are suspended in blood plasma, along with various dissolved solutes such as Na+ and clotting factors. The main difference between this matrix and those of other tissues is that plasma is liquid, whereas other types of tissues have solid or semisolid matrices. Plasma also doesn't remain solely in the circulatory system-a small amount is squeezed out of the capillarie"}, {"url": "http://www.siumed.edu/~dking2/intro/blood.htm", "passage_text": "Blood is traditionally classified as a specialized form of connective tissue.
