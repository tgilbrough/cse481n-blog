Just as the subcutaneous tissue can store fat, it can also provide good storage space for drugs that need to be released gradually because there is limited blood flow.

It provides shock-absorbent padding for the body and an insulating layer to conserve heat. The fat stored here also serves as an energy source.

Adipose tissue is found in specific locations, which are referred to as adipose depots. Visceral fat or abdominal fat (also known as organ fat or intra-abdominal fat) is located inside the abdominal cavity, packed between the organs (stomach, liver, intestines, kidneys, etc.). Visceral fat is different from subcutaneous fat underneath the skin, and intramuscular fat interspersed in skeletal muscles."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue", "passage_text": "Subcutaneous fat is the layer of subcutaneous tissue that is most widely distributed. It is composed of adipocytes, which are grouped together in lobules separated by connective tissue.
