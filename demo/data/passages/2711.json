The subclass of these diseases that have neuromuscular disease symptoms are often called a mitochondrial myopathy. Mitochondrial diseases are sometimes (about 15% of the time) caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA that affect mitochondria"}, {"url": "http://www.umdf.org/site/c.8qKOJ0MvF7LUG/b.7934627/k.3711/What_is_Mitochondrial_Disease.htm", "passage_text": "Mitochondrial diseases result from failures of the mitochondria, specialized compartments present in every cell of the body except red blood cells. Mitochondria are responsible for creating more than 90% of the energy needed by the body to sustain life and support growth. When they fail, less and less energy is generated within the cell. Cell injury and even cell death follow. The conventional teaching in biology and medicine is that mitochondria function only as energy factories for the cell. This over-simplification is a mistake which has slowed our progress toward understanding the biology underlying mitochondrial disease. It takes about 3000 genes to make a mitochondrion."}, {"url": "http://www.medicinenet.com/mitochondrial_disease/article.htm", "passage_text": "1 Mitochondrial disease includes a group of neuromuscular diseases caused by damage to intracellular structures that produce energy, the mitochondria; disease symptoms usually involve muscle contractions that are weak or spontaneous. 2  There is no specific treatment for mitochondrial diseases (myopathies).

Almost all cells in the body have mitochondria, which are tiny \u201cpower plants\u201d that produce a body\u2019s essential energy. Mitochondrial disease means the power plants in cells don\u2019t function properly. When that happens, some functions in the body don\u2019t work normally. It\u2019s as if the body has a power failure: there is a gradation of effects, like a \u2018brown out\u2019 or a \u2018black out\u2019. Scientifically, it is actually a category or group of diseases. Most importantly, when a diagnosis of mitochondrial disease or disorder is considered, patients need to be evaluated carefully for diseases other than mitochondrial disease. For example, the muscle biopsy can be used to look at other types of muscle diseases."}, {"url": "http://www.umdf.org/site/pp.aspx?c=8qKOJ0MvF7LUG&b=7934639", "passage_text": "In a person with mitochondrial disease, the mitochondria are failing and cannot convert food and oxygen into life-sustaining energy.
