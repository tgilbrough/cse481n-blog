Based on planes of division, the coccus shape can appear in several distinct arrangements: diplococcus, streptococcus, tetrad, sarcina, and staphylococcus. For example, bacillus-shaped bacteria that have an inactivated MreB gene become coccoid shaped, and coccus-shaped bacteria naturally lack the MreB gene.

Cocci may be oval, elongated, or flattened on one side. Cocci that divide in multiple planes and form grape like clusters or sheets are called staphylococci. Bacilli.
