Trypsin is produced in the pancreas as the inactive protease trypsinogen. Trypsin cleaves peptide chains mainly at the carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine or arginine, except when either is followed by proline. It is used for numerous biotechnological processes.

Trypsinogen is an enzyme released by the pancreas that is used to break down proteins found in foods. Before it reaches the digestive tract, the enzyme is inactive. Once it reaches the intestines, trypsinogen is converted to its active form, trypsin. Levels of this enzyme present in the bloodstream can be monitored to determine if there is a problem with pancreas function. Proteases, such as trypsinogen, are enzymes that digest proteins."}, {"url": "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/trypsinogen", "passage_text": "Noun. 1. trypsinogen-inactive precursor of trypsin; a substance secreted by the pancreas and converted to active trypsin by enterokinase in the small intestine. trypsin-an enzyme of pancreatic origin; catalyzes the hydrolysis of proteins to smaller polypeptide units.

This larger molecule is inactive until it is transported to the small intestine and acted upon by enteropeptidase, another type of protease. Once this step has taken place, trypsin can activate itself. Trypsin is part of the digestive system and degrades proteins, making it an enzyme known as a protease. It is initially formed as a larger, inactive molecule in the pancreas and is transported to the small intestine, where it is activated to digest food molecules."}]
