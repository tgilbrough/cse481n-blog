Cells are the smallest unit of life that can replicate independently, and are often called the building blocks of life. The study of cells is called cell biology. Cells consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell; including bacteria) or multicellular (including plants and animals). The DNA of a prokaryotic cell consists of a single chromosome that is in direct contact with the cytoplasm. The nuclear region in the cytoplasm is called the nucleoid. Most prokaryotes are the smallest of all organisms ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 \u00b5m in diameter."}, {"url": "http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/fungimm.html", "passage_text": "Fungi: More on Morphology. Like plants and animals, fungi are eukaryotic multicellular organisms. Unlike these other groups, however, fungi are composed of filaments called hyphae; their cells are long and thread-like and connected end-to-end, as you can see in the picture below. Rather, the filaments are long and tubular, with a cytoplasm lining and large vacuole in the center. By contrast, the ascomycetes and basidiomycetes are septate; their filaments are partitioned by cellular cross-walls called septa. The structure of these septa varies, and is taxonomically useful."}, {"url": "https://askabiologist.asu.edu/content/cell-parts", "passage_text": "1 Chromosome: a long, thread-like molecule made of the chemical called DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that is held together with special proteins and is visible (with strong microscopes) during cell division... 2  more. 3  Molecule: a chemical structure that has two or more atoms held together by a chemical bond.

This is a long carbohydrate polymer that also occurs in the exoskeletons of insects, spiders, and other arthropods. The chitin adds rigidity and structural support to the thin cells of the fungus, and makes fresh mushrooms crisp.

The parent cell divides into two daughter cells. The process then repeats in what is called the cell cycle. Cells regulate their division by communicating with each other using chemical signals from special proteins called cyclins. It is also important for cells to stop dividing at the right time. If a cell can not stop dividing when it is supposed to stop, this can lead to a disease called cancer. Some cells, like skin cells, are constantly dividing. We need to continuously make new skin cells to replace the skin cells we lose."}, {"url": "https://askabiologist.asu.edu/content/cell-division", "passage_text": "1 Chromosome: a long, thread-like molecule made of the chemical called DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that is held together with special proteins and is visible (with strong microscopes) during cell division... 2  more. 3  DNA: deoxyribonucleic acid is the information blue-print of the cell.
