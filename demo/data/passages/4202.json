Because the insurance company's liability is limited to a specific period, term is the most economical kind of life insurance. A whole life insurance policy lasts as long as you pay the premiums. Whole life policies can also have a cash value. Part of the premium you pay covers your insurance, and some of it goes into the policy's cash value. Whole life insurance is much more expensive than term life insurance for the dollar amount of coverage. Most financial planners recommend coverage that's 5 to 10 times your annual income. For example, if you make $50,000, you might consider coverage between $250,000 and $500,000. If you're younger and just starting a family, you might need as much as 15 times your income to allow for salary increases."}, {"url": "https://www.selectquote.com/calculator/how-much-term-life-insurance-do-i-need.aspx", "passage_text": "Start by adding up your family's monthly expenses.

Right now, you may be just starting to save for retirement, but by the time you actually retire, you'll have $500,000 or $1 million in your retirement plan, so you may no longer need that $500,000 life insurance policy.."}, {"url": "http://www.kiplinger.com/article/insurance/T034-C000-S002-how-much-life-insurance-do-you-need.html", "passage_text": "They also complicate the issue of how much life insurance is right for you.
