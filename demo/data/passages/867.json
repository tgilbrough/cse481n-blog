Mollusks are invertebrates that live in ocean, freshwater and terrestrial habitats. It is estimated that there are as many as 120,000 different species of mollusk. There are several different classes of mollusk. The most common mollusks are the gastropods (e.g., snails and slugs), the cephalopod (e.g., octopus, squid and cuttlefish) and the bivalve (e.g., clam, muscle, oyster and scallop).

The bivalves (meaning two-shells) are perhaps the most well known mollusks simply because of their history as a source of food. Clams, mussels, oysters and scallops are all bivalves.
