Some Web sites just say under 40\u00b0F, but not so cold to freeze fresh foods. Dairy products and meats keep best at the low end of the temperature range. A freezer should be set at 0\u00b0F, or lower, if possible. If the temperature gets warmer than +5\u00b0F, ice cream will be too soft and won't keep well. A properly working food freezer will operate in the range of -10\u00b0F to +2\u00b0F, and may go up to around +8\u00b0F briefly during the defrost cycle if it is of the frost free type.
