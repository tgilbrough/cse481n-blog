Over 90% of the creatine in the human body is found in muscle. Bodybuilders consider creatine a necessity for getting results. Creatine monohydrate is the most cost-effective dietary supplement in terms of muscle mass and strength gains. Creatine can help support protein synthesis, which helps muscles grow. Creatine supplementation has been studied for over 80 years-broad use of this substance has only gained popularity in the past decade. A new course is available at Weik University on creatine monohydrate. Those interested in sitting through an easy course, no need to look any further because class has just begun. Everyone is guaranteed an A for the course as long as you sit through the course and pay attention (you can take notes if you wish)."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/men/creatine", "passage_text": "Creatine is a natural substance that turns into creatine phosphate in the body. Creatine phosphate helps make a substance called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP provides the energy for muscle contractions. The body produces some of the creatine it uses.
