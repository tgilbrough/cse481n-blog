A fistula (surgical connection between a vein and an artery under the skin) is as close as we can get today to an ideal access.

Your arteries and veins are usually too small, so surgery is done to create a vascular access site. There are 3 kinds of vascular access sites: 1  A fistula (also called an arteriovenous fistula or A-V fistula) is made by joining an artery and a vein under the skin in your arm. 2  When the artery and vein are joined, the pressure inside the vein increases, making the walls of the vein stronger"}, {"url": "http://panettavascular.com/dialysis-access-management.asp", "passage_text": "AV Fistula Creation. AV (arteriovenous) fistulas are recognized as the preferred access method. To create a fistula, a vascular surgeon joins an artery and a vein together through anastomosis. Since this bypasses the capillaries, blood flows rapidly through the fistula. One can feel this by placing one's finger over a mature fistula."}, {"url": "http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriovenous-fistula/basics/definition/CON-20034876", "passage_text": "Arteriovenous fistula. An arteriovenous (AV) fistula is an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein. Normally, blood flows from your arteries to your capillaries to your veins. Nutrients and oxygen in your blood travel from your capillaries to tissues in your body. With an arteriovenous fistula, blood flows directly from an artery into a vein, bypassing some capillaries. When this happens, tissues below the bypassed capillaries receive a diminished blood supply.
