Approximately one-half of cases of scleritis are associated with underlying diseases that affect the body internally (systemic diseases). 1 Scleritis is an inflammation of the white of the eye. 2  It is serious eye disease which is often associated with underlying autoimmune disorders. 3  Prompt diagnosis and treatment is essential in preventing permanent vision loss."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.boots.com/eye-health/guide/scleritis", "passage_text": "The sclera is visible as the white area of the eye.
