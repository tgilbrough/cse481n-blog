To date, there are five different types of taste receptors known: salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. Each receptor has a different manner of sensory transduction: that is, detecting the presence of a certain compound and starting an action potential which ultimately alerts the brain."}, {"url": "http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s2/chapter09.html", "passage_text": "Taste and smell are the principal systems for distinguishing flavors. However, tactile, thermal, and nociceptive sensory input from the oral mucosa contributes to food quality.
