It is a concept that started in the year 1816 and was carried out by an astronomer by the name of Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve. During the time of Struve\u2019s existence, the distance between two points was measured by measuring poles. However in order to accomplish the goal that Friedrich von Struve had envisioned-calculating the size of the earth-measuring poles would not be sufficient.
