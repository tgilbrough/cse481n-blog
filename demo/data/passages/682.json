Yes, Ann, a cardiologist should interpret an abnormal EKG, a recording of the electrical activity of the heart, taking into account your overall health. An abnormal EKG does not necessarily indicate life-threatening heart disease or any heart disease at all, for that matter. In fact, EKGs can be abnormal for many reasons, and a cardiologist is most qualified to figure out why.
