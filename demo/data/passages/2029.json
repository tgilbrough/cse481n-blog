The cochlea is the hearing part of the inner ear. The semicircular canals in the inner ear are part of our balance system. The cochlea is a bony structure shaped like a snail and filled with two fluids (endolymph and perilymph). The Organ of Corti is the sensory receptor inside the cochlea which holds the hair cells, the nerve receptors for hearing. The mechanical energy from movement of the middle ear bones pushes in a membrane (the oval window) in the cochlea. This force moves the cochlea's fluids that, in turn, stimulate tiny hair cells."}, {"url": "http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/organ/sensory_receptors_for_hearing.htm", "passage_text": "Conditions that can afflict the sensory receptors for hearing include deterioration of the hair cells, aging, chronic exposure to loud noise, nerve deafness, and trauma."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_sensory_receptor_for_hearing", "passage_text": "In the mammalian ear the sensory receptors (hair cells) for hearing are in the cochlea and for ballance are in the semicircular canals.
