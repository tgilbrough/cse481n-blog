For example, a 160-lb. individual running at 8 mph would burn 986 calories in an hour. This amount needs to be matched in the diet. The body also requires 500 calories a day just to add muscles. Physical exertion requires a large amount of energy, which means that athletes need to consume more calories than the average person. The fundamental purpose of an athlete's diet does not consider weight loss, so athletes must consume as many calories as they burn."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/311097-how-many-calories-should-an-athlete-have-a-day/", "passage_text": "An athlete usually needs at least 1,000 calories beyond the average person's diet.
