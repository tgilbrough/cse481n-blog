It is produced from starch by partial hydrolysis and is usually found as a white hygroscopic spray-dried powder. Maltodextrin is easily digestible, being absorbed as rapidly as glucose, and might be either moderately sweet or almost flavorless. If wheat is used to make maltodextrin, it does not need to appear on the label. Maltodextrin derived from cereals containing gluten is exempt from labeling, as set out in Annex II of EC Directive 2000/13."}, {"url": "http://www.glutenfreeliving.com/gluten-free-foods/ingredients/top-10-ingredients-you-really-dont-need-to-worry-about/", "passage_text": "Maltodextrin. Why it\u2019s on worry lists: Maltodextrin can be made from a variety of starches, including corn, potato, rice or wheat.

Why you don\u2019t need to worry: Despite what the CFR says, companies use corn because corn produces a better product.

Starches other than corn, rice, or potato can be used to make maltodextrin as long as the company self-determines GRAS and the resulting maltodextrin has the same chemical structure as the maltodextrins made from corn, rice, or potato as described in Food Chemicals Codex."}, {"url": "http://www.glutenfreeliving.com/gluten-free-foods/ingredients/ingredients-index/", "passage_text": "Maltodextrin is gluten free.
