A drop of blood or the root of a hair contains enough DNA for testing. Semen, hair, or skin scrapings are often used in criminal investigations. A person who has DNA fingerprinting done voluntarily usually provides a sample of blood taken from a vein. Why It Is Done.

Although 99.9% of human DNA sequences are the same in every person, enough of the DNA is different that it is possible to distinguish one individual from another, unless they are monozygotic (identical) twins."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-dna-fingerprint.htm", "passage_text": "A person's DNA profile is unique.

DNA fingerprinting is a laboratory technique used to establish a link between biological evidence and a suspect in a criminal investigation. A DNA sample taken from a crime scene is compared with a DNA sample from a suspect. If the two DNA profiles are a match, then the evidence came from that suspect. Conversely, if the two DNA profiles do not match, then the evidence cannot have come from the suspect."}, {"url": "http://www.fingerprinting.com/what-is-dna-fingerprinting.php", "passage_text": "DNA Fingerprinting is a procedure whereby the genetic information, called DNA, in a person's cells is analysed and identified. The word fingerprinting is used because, just like a fingerprint, no two person's genetic code is exactly the same. This makes DNA fingerprinting a very useful tool for our modern society.
