Her early leaf's a flower; But only so an hour. \u2026 Then leaf subsides to leaf. So Eden sank to grief, So dawn goes down to day. Nothing gold can stay. This poem means that good things in life cannot stay anything gold must leave."}, {"url": "http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/frost/gold.htm", "passage_text": "It is as if in writing Nothing Gold Can Stay, Frost had in mind his later definition of poetry as a momentary stay against confusion. The poem's last word proclaims the momentariness of the gold that things like flowers and Eden, dawn and poems share. So the shortness of the poem is also expressive of its sense."}]
