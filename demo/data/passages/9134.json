The romance angle is somewhat forced and never fully realized, leaving the overall message a little cloudy. Truthfully, 100 different fans may have 100 different ways to explain \u2018If I Die Young,\u2019 as well. Subtle obfuscation has served the Band Perry well."}, {"url": "http://tasteofcountry.com/blake-shelton-ashley-monroe-lonely-tonight/", "passage_text": "Warner Music Nashville.
