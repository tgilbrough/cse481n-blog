The basic secretory units of salivary glands are clusters of cells called an acini. These cells secrete a fluid that contains water, electrolytes, mucus and enzymes, all of which flow out of the acinus into collecting ducts. Most animals have three major pairs of salivary glands that differ in the type of secretion they produce: 1  parotid glands produce a serous, watery secretion. 2  submaxillary (mandibular) glands produce a mixed serous and mucous"}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/83617-saliva-made/", "passage_text": "Saliva helps moisten food and also starts the digestive process.

Human saliva is 99.5% water, while the other 0.5% consists of electrolytes, mucus, glycoproteins, enzymes, antibacterial, and bacteria compounds such as secretory IgA and lysozyme. The enzymes found in saliva are essential in beginning the process of digestion of dietary starches and fats. There is much debate about the amount of saliva that is produced in a healthy person per day; estimates range from 0.75 to 1.5 litres per day while it is generally accepted that during sleep the amount drops to almost zero."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Where_is_saliva_produced", "passage_text": "Saliva is produced from the salivary glands.The basic unit in the salivary glands are clusters of cells called acini.These cells create a fluid that contains water,Electrolyte \u2026 s, my as and enzymes all of which flow out From the acinus into the collecting ducts. 1 person found this useful.
