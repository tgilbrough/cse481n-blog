They may even be launched, as they frequently were in Earth\u2019s ancient past, by the impact of a large meteorite plunging into an ocean.

The first wave in a tsunami is not necessarily the most destructive. Tsunamis are not tidal waves.

Out in the depths of the ocean, tsunami waves do not dramatically increase in height.
