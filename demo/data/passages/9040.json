If covered and properly refrigerated, they will last a week or longer. Cooked vegetables should be placed in covered containers with some airspace. Air prevents the germination of botulism spores (which requires air). These spores are not killed by boiling (212\u00b0F) temperatures. The fact that there is air present will allow mold growth, but, if the leftovers are properly refrigerated, they should keep for several days. How long they keep depends on the vegetable, what else was in the product, and the \u201cavailable\u201d water (water not tied up with solutes like salt, sugar). The website AlgerWiki says the following: - leftover cooked meat and meat dishes: 3-4 days. - leftover leftover poultry: (dishes and pieces) 3-4 days; pieces covered with broth: 1-2 days. - leftover carryout: 3-4 days (assuming it had been refrigerated within 2 hours of serving).

Ideally it should be eaten within about two days, but if it is not, it will remain edible for at least four days time. If you are planning to keep it longer, your best bet is to freeze it. Potato soup freezes remarkably well, even if it is done with ham and cheese or some other meat.
