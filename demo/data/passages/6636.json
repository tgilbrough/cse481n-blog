I would go a step further and say, considering they're taking in $20 million a week, they should cover all N.J. driver's river-crossing tolls."}, {"url": "http://www.idrivewithuber.com/how-much-do-uber-drivers-make/", "passage_text": "There is also no such thing as an Uber driver salary. As described above, drivers are paid a portion of the fare for every ride that is given. As promised, here is an example of my pay for one 10 \u00bd hour day: $256.30 / 10.5 hours = $24.41 an hour."}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-you-earn-as-an-uber-driver-2014-6", "passage_text": "So that's $15 an hour. But accounting for tolls, Uber's 20% cut, gas, car insurance, vehicle financing, and self employment taxes, the driver really only made $54.50 for 12 hours of driving.

As a practical example, let\u2019s assume you make $20 an hour after taxes and expenses, and you work 40 hours a week, like a regular full-time job: $19 x 40 hours/week= $760 a week."}]
