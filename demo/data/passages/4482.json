These changes are most often brought on by problems that occur during meiosis (cell division process of gametes) or by mutagens (chemicals, radiation, etc.). A chromosome mutation that results in individuals with more than one haploid set of chromosomes in a cell is termed polyploidy. A haploid cell is a cell that contains one complete set of chromosomes. Our sex cells are considered haploid and contain 1 complete set of 23 chromosomes"}, {"url": "http://www.audioenglish.org/dictionary/chromosomal_mutation.htm", "passage_text": "\u2022 CHROMOSOMAL MUTATION (noun). The noun CHROMOSOMAL MUTATION has 1 sense: 1. (genetics) any event that changes genetic structure; any alteration in the inherited nucleic acid sequence of the genotype of an organism.

A chromosomal mutation is a mutation involving a long segment of DNA, it is a any change in the structure or arrangement of the chromosomes. These mutations can involve deletions, insertions, or inversions of sections of DNA. a gene mutation can be acquired throughout life or it is genetic ex sickle cell anemia chromsome mutations have more pronounced effects and are due to a change in the number \u2026 of chromosomes or a change in the structural effect that are inherited.."}, {"url": "http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation", "passage_text": "A gene mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene, such that the sequence differs from what is found in most people.

Mutations result from damage to DNA which is not repaired, errors in the process of replication, or from the insertion or deletion of segments of DNA by mobile genetic elements.
