Genes occur on chromosomes. Mutations in genes can cause metabolic errors and genetic diseases. Without an understanding of DNA structure, it was unclear to scientists how DNA was used by cells. From DNA to RNA to Protein. In order to synthesize a protein, the genetic information in the DNA must be converted to an amino acid sequence. Its similar to the way that someone needs to read a recipe and mix the correct ingredients together.

DNA is made up of molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a phosphate group, a sugar group and a nitrogen base.

If you took the DNA from all the cells in your body and lined it up, end to end, it would form a strand 6000 million miles long (but very, very thin)!
