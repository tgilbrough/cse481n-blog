[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye", "passage_text": "Pit eyes, also known as stemma, are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eyespot, to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light. Found in about 85% of phyla, these basic forms were probably the precursors to more advanced types of simple eye. A compound eye may consist of thousands of individual photoreceptor units or ommatidia (ommatidium, singular). The image perceived is a combination of inputs from the numerous ommatidia (individual eye units), which are located on a convex surface, thus pointing in slightly different directions."}, {"url": "http://www.allaboutvision.com/eye-test/", "passage_text": "The chart can be used in two different ways, depending on what your eye doctor is trying to measure: 1  The chart is held at a specified reading distance (such as 12 inches) and you are asked to read the passage with the smallest type you can see.

Just behind the iris and pupil lies the lens, which helps to focus light on the back of the eye. Most of the eye is filled with a clear gel called the vitreous. Light projects through the pupil and the lens to the back of the eye. The inside lining of the eye is covered by special light-sensing cells that are collectively called the retina. The retina converts light into electrical impulses. Behind the eye, the optic nerve carries these impulses to the brain.
