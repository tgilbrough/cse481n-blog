[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome", "passage_text": "A liposome is a spherical vesicle having at least one lipid bilayer. The liposome can be used as a vehicle for administration of nutrients and pharmaceutical drugs. Liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes (such as by sonication). Liposomes are most often composed of phospholipids, especially phosphatidylcholine, but may also include other lipids, such as egg phosphatidylethanolamine, so long as they are compatible with lipid bilayer structure. A liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to unhealthy tissue"}, {"url": "http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Liposomes", "passage_text": "Liposomes are being developed as an approach for drug delivery in which relatively toxic drugs, e.g., amphotericin b, doxorubicin, and pentavalent antimony, are wrapped inside a liposome and tagged with an organ-specific antibody.
