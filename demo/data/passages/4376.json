If you choose to buy from the couple's wedding registry, we recommend purchasing early, so you have the best selection of gifts and price ranges. We just don't know how much we are expected to spend on a wedding gift. Unfortunately, there's no simple answer and no set amount you should spend (or amount you should give if gifting cash).

It's better to give something smaller, than wait a long time to be able to afford something more expensive. Answer: Traditional etiquette says that you have up to a year following the wedding. Try to purchase one sooner though, so that there are still items available on the registry, and so that the new couple can start using your gift."}]
