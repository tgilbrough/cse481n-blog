It is really a collection of reactions and responses that the body makes to damaged cells or infection. Cancer can weaken the immune system by spreading into the bone marrow.

They are often referred to as scavengers or antigen-presenting cells (APC) because they pick up and ingest foreign materials and present these antigens to other cells of the immune system such as T cells and B cells. The immune system is composed of many interdependent cell types that collectively protect the body from bacterial, parasitic, fungal, viral infections and from the growth of tumor cells. Many of these cell types have specialized functions."}]
