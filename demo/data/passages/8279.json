Ok alittle confused on this one. I'm looking to learn how you determine your session price per bed. in my area seems the average for a 20 minute bed is $7 a session. $12-15 for a vhr and $9 for a stand up per session. should I base my prices on what others in area charge or is there a formula to use. I think typicallybase beds average $6-$8 per sessionVhr $12-$20 per sessionHigh Presure $25 to $40 per session Theese are walk in prices not for packages and you can also use minute packages succesfullly as well. It greatly depends on your equipment and your competitors equipment though."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080916200413AA9LLWw", "passage_text": "Answers. Relevance.
