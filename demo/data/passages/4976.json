The advent of fixed-wing aircraft in 1903 was followed in 1910 by the first flight from the deck of a US Navy cruiser. Seaplanes and seaplane tender support ships, such as HMS Engadine, followed. The development of flat top vessels produced the first large fleet ships. During the Second World War, these ships would become the backbone of the carrier forces of the US, British, and Japanese navies, known as fleet carriers. World War II saw the first large-scale use of aircraft carriers and induced further refinement of their launch and recovery cycle leading to several design variants."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Who_invented_the_aircraft_carrier", "passage_text": "The first US carrier was a converted coal ship, the Jupiter, which became USS Langley in 1920. The first aircraft carrier designed with a flight deck was the Japanese carrier Hosho (1922), followed by the commissioning of the British carrier HMS Hermes in 1924. The British built the first true aircraft carrier in 1918. Earlier aircraft carriers were cruisers with wooden platforms built over their decks for airplane runways.

It was a simple mixture of 86% ice and 14% per cent wood pulp. Despite the name, Pykrete isn\u2019t a fictional material from Star Trek but a real substance made from wood chips and ice with strange and fantastical properties that were actually considered for use in building Royal Navy aircraft carriers during World War II, especially for use in the battle of the Atlantic."}, {"url": "http://www.libertyreferences.com/aircraft-carrier.shtml", "passage_text": "The invention of the aircraft carrier has immensely influenced the USA\u2019s freedoms.
