Renal parenchymal disease is not a single disease but a pathological state. Renal parenchyma is opposed to renal interstitium which is the tissues of supporting and connective functions.

The kidney parenchyma is the bulk of the kidney organ, without considering the other things around it (the adrenal, the blood vessels, the capsule, etc.).
