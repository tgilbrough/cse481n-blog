Tizer from the early 2000\u2019s and was ended in 2006 was a beautiful unique tasting drink. Me and my pals were so excited as they started bringing out different colour versions of the drink, including purple which tasted incredible. Tizer was a dominant force in the pop/soda world. But then they changed it to the tizer we have nowadays. It now tastes disgusting and leaves a horrible feeling in your throat. I\u2019m 18, I\u2019ve still got along time ahead of me to see the old tizer maybe return one day. It was my favourite pop of all time."}, {"url": "http://www.dizzyfrinks.com/tizer/", "passage_text": "You have rated this. About the Drink.
