Botanists, who study plant species, have identified more than 300,000 species of plants that presently exist. The existing species can be broken down into a few groups, including bryophytes, ferns, fern allies, and seed plants. Seed plants, which are also referred to as spermatophytes, reproduce by producing seeds. Flowering plants and conifer trees are examples of this type of plants. Many fruits and vegetables are also part of the seed plant variety. Ad. Ferns, like bryophytes, reproduce via spores."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_plant", "passage_text": "Native plants form a part of a cooperative environment, or plant community, where several species or environments have developed to support them. This could be a case where a plant exists because a certain animal pollinates the plant and that animal exists because it relies on the pollen as a source of food. Although some types of plants for these reasons exist only within a very limited range (endemism), others can live in diverse areas or by adaptation to different surroundings. Research has found that insects depend on native plants."}, {"url": "http://www.nwf.org/Wildlife/Threats-to-Wildlife/Invasive-Species.aspx", "passage_text": "An invasive species can be any kind of living organism\u2014an amphibian (like the cane toad pictured left), plant, insect, fish, fungus, bacteria, or even an organism\u2019s seeds or eggs\u2014that is not native to an ecosystem and which causes harm. They can harm the environment, the economy or even, human health. 1 Aggressive plant species like kudzu can quickly replace a diverse ecosystem with a monoculture of just kudzu. 2  Altering ecosystem conditions: Some invasive species are capable of changing the conditions in an ecosystem, such as changing soil chemistry or the intensity of wildfires."}, {"url": "http://www.theplantlist.org/", "passage_text": "Search.

In many cases, plants from other parts of the world are welcomed, manageable additions to our gardens. However, in some situations these non-native species cause serious ecological disturbances. They are most threatening in ecosystems such as wetlands, sand dunes, fire prone areas, and serpentine barrens where rare native plants are found. Invasive plant species thrive where the continuity of a natural ecosystem is breached and are abundant on disturbed sites like construction areas and road cuts."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_plant", "passage_text": "An alternative, but potentially conflicting, usage is to describe plants (and animals) that are indigenous to a geographical area, even if they are known to have self-introduced in historical times, e.g. the Silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) of New Zealand, which was first recorded in the 19th century.
