It uses the Doppler effect to provide an audible simulation of the heart beat. Fetal heart rates [edit]. Starting at week 5 the fetal heart rate accelerates by 3.3 bpm per day for the next month. The fetal heart begins to beat at approximately the same rate as the mother's, which is typically 80 to 85 bpm.

The fetal heart rate can usually be detected with a fetal ultrasound doppler as early as 8 weeks. The normal fetal heart rate is between 110 to 180 beats per minute, but can vary slights. Fluctuations can occur throughout the day due to activity level and are completely normal. The fetus\u2019 heart begins to beat at 5 weeks gestation, at around 80-85 beats per minute. This rate increases about 3 beats per minute per day during the first month. When the fetus heart is first developed it resembles that of a tube."}]
