Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a large family of RNA molecules that convey genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where they specify the amino acid sequence of the protein products of gene expression. Transcription is when RNA is made from DNA. During transcription, RNA polymerase makes a copy of a gene from the DNA to mRNA as needed. This process is similar in eukaryotes and prokaryotes."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA", "passage_text": "One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a universal function wherein mRNA molecules direct the assembly of proteins on ribosomes. This process uses transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then links amino acids together to form proteins. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome.

Messenger RNA. Whereas most types of RNA are the final products of their genes, messenger RNA (mRNA) is an intermediate in the information transfer process. It carries information from DNA to the ribosome in a genetic code that the protein-synthesizing machinery translates into protein. Protein synthesis is the process by which cells build or manufacture proteins.
