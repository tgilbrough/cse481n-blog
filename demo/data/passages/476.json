There are many disadvantages of hydroelectric power due to which it is not used on a very large scale all around the globe. Before employing something on an industrial level, you should consider pros and cons of hydropower. So the disadvantages are: The reservoir of water for hydroelectric power releases a large amount of carbon dioxide and methane. The area around the dam is filled with water. The plants and trees in them start rotting and decompose by other method without the use of oxygen."}, {"url": "http://water.usgs.gov/edu/hydroadvantages.html", "passage_text": "1. Hydroelectricity is a renewable energy source. Hydroelectricity uses the energy of running water, without reducing its quantity, to produce electricity. Therefore, all hydroelectric developments, of small or large size, whether run of the river or of accumulated storage, fit the concept of renewable energy. 2.

Hydroelectric energy is considered a renewable energy resource because it's an energy resource that regenerates in a short time period. You can think of this like the hair on your head. While hydroelectric energy can be a very beneficial renewable resource, there are also drawbacks to using water to generate electricity. While the maintenance costs are low after the dam is built, they're very expensive to construct and require large up-front investments."}, {"url": "http://www.renewables-info.com/drawbacks_and_benefits/hydropower_advantages_and_disadvantages.html", "passage_text": "Hydropower advantages and disadvantages.
