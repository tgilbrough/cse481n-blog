The recommended adequate intake of sodium for adults up to age 50 is 1,500 milligrams daily. Adequate daily intake for older Americans is 1,300 milligrams from age 50 through 70 and 1,200 milligrams after age 70.

And if you have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and consume too much sodium, you are at greater risk for complications, including high blood pressure and heart disease. According to the 2010 guidelines, sodium should be limited to 2,300 mg a day. For people 51 years or older, African Americans and anyone who has hypertension, diabetes or CKD, the new sodium goal is 1,500 mg a day.

If the label has more than 1.5g of salt (or 0.6g of sodium) per 100g it is a high salt content food. If it has 0.3g of salt (0.1g of sodium) per 100g then it is a low salt content food.

Evidence shows that consuming too much sodium can raise blood pressure, which is a risk factor for stroke. High blood pressure can also lead to heart disease, kidney disease and congestive heart failure. Most Americans will benefit from a lower sodium diet. Look for foods that have fewer than 200 milligrams of sodium per serving. Look for low sodium on the food label; this means the food has fewer than 140 milligrams of sodium per serving.

The recommended amount of sodium that you should consume in a day depends on your age. Children ages 2 to 3 need 1,000 mg of sodium a day. That amount increases to 1,200 mg a day from ages 4 to 8 and 1,500 mg from 9 to 18.

The American Heart Association recommends limiting your sodium intake to less than 2,000 milligrams per day. And this may be easier said than done, due to the amount of sodium found in processed and canned foods. Frozen foods can even contain high amounts of sodium in an effort to keep them fresh longer. Sodium plays a huge role in leading a healthy, sensible lifestyle. If you do not consume enough sodium in your diet on a daily basis, your body cannot maintain healthy fluid levels, and it may have a negative impact on the way your muscles expand and contract, especially during exercise."}]
