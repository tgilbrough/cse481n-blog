Potato starch. Potato starch \u2013 also known as potato flour \u2013 is extracted from potatoes. The cells of the root tubers of the potato plant contain starch granules (leucoplasts). To extract the starch, the potatoes are crushed and the starch grains are released from the cells.

The powdery, fine starch made from corn is known as Corn starch which is also called cornflour. The endosperm of corn is crushed, washed and dried up until it becomes a fine powder. Corn starch or Maize starch contains low ash and protein. It has its use in many baked good recipes. Corn starch is often used with flour and lends a good texture to wheat flour and makes it soft. In sugar wafer shells and ice cream cones it adds a reasonable strength.
