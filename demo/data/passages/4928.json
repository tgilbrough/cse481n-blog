In one case, scientists successfully produced a goat/sheep mix. They have also been able to produce a chimera quail/chicken. Most often these attempts fail, and if they do work, the animal produced is often sterile."}, {"url": "http://house.wikia.com/wiki/Chimerism", "passage_text": "Chimerism is a very rare condition caused by the fusion of zygotes (fertilized eggs) into a single form during early cell duplication. It is extremely rare, with only forty or so known human cases.

In these cases, chimerism may manifest as the presence of two sets of DNA, or organs that do not match the DNA of the rest of the organism. In some cases, hermaphroditic characteristics, in other words, having both male and female sex organs, can be signs of chimerism."}, {"url": "http://www.brighthub.com/science/genetics/articles/39124.aspx", "passage_text": "Chimerism refers to organisms possessing more than one genetic identity. The term \u201cchimera\u201d comes from a mythological composite creature made from parts of other animals. In humans, a chimera can be the result of two embryos becoming fused.

Because chimerism involves cells from one twin being present in the other, it is a visible sign and proof that the placental membranes had fused."}]
