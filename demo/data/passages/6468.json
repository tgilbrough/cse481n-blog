In conclusion, lowering body temperature protects against the immediate decrease in tryptophan hydroxylase activity induced by 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, suggesting that hyperthermia plays a prominent role in the acute as well as the long-term decrease in enzyme activity."}, {"url": "http://www.cigna.com/healthwellness/hw/medical-tests/body-temperature-hw198785", "passage_text": "Your normal temperature may actually be 1\u00b0F (0.6\u00b0C) or more above or below this.
