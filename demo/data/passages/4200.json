Baltic amber is mainly found in the areas surrounding the Baltic Sea which is why it is called \u201cBaltic\u201d amber. Resin has been found in Poland, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Denmark, Sweden, Holland, Belorussia and as far west as the United Kingdom. Baltic amber accounts for over 90% of the world\u2019s known amber today; however, amber is found all over the world including Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Amber is not to be confused with sap, which flows through the tree's heartwood to transport nutrients to the tree. Resin has a syrupy consistency and piney fragrance, which comes from chemicals known as terpenes (a naturally-occurring hydrocarbon)."}, {"url": "http://www.sfgms.org/articles/taffelamber.html", "passage_text": "The Greeks called amber elektro, from which the word electricity is derived because if you rub amber with a cloth it will become charged, enabling it to attract small pieces of paper.

However, since amber is organic, and is not inorganic with an ordered crystalline structure, it is NOT a mineral. Amber's color can vary depending on the source of the hardened tree resin.
