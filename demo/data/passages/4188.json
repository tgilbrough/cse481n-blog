Standards for disease-causing organisms in Louisiana are based on a group of bacteria called fecal coliform bacteria. These bacteria are used for detecting the level of disease-causing organisms and untreated sewage in water. Fecal coliform bacteria come from intestines of warm-blooded animals. Disease-causing organisms get into the water from untreated sewage. When people go to the bathroom they create waste called sewage. Every home, school, and business is required by law to have some way of treating its sewage or transporting it to a sewage treatment system."}, {"url": "http://www.safewater.org/PDFS/resourcesknowthefacts/Disease_Causing_Micro_Org.pdf", "passage_text": "These \u201cbad-news\u201d microbes are called disease-causing microbes and can make humans, animals and plants sick by causing infection and disease.

Infectious disease, also known as transmissible disease or communicable disease, is illness resulting from an infection. Infections are caused by infectious agents including viruses, viroids, prions, bacteria, nematodes such as parasitic roundworms and pinworms, arthropods such as ticks, mites, fleas, and lice, fungi such as ringworm, and other macroparasites such as tapeworms and other helminths."}, {"url": "http://regentsprep.org/Regents/biology/2011%20Web%20Pages/Human%20Body-%20Immune%20System%20and%20Disease%20page.htm", "passage_text": "Disease is a disturbance of homeostasis or steady state within an organism. Many organisms, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites may cause disease. Disease also results from factors which are not living organisms. The immune response is the defensive reaction of the body to foreign substances or organisms. Living organisms which cause disease are known as pathogens. Some viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites are examples of living things which are pathogens causing disease.

They can be bacteria, fungus etc etc. Your other three answers could be examples for pathogens, though without the species name you cannot identify any of those micro organisms as a disease causing organism. Archaebacteria, it can cause Lyme disease Bacilli can cause meningitis's Cocci can cause scarlet fever. But a disease causing organism is A, pathogen. B, C, D are all pathogens..... So the answer is A."}]
