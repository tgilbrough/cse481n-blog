Artery is a flexible, muscular BLOOD vessel that carries blood from the HEART and oxygenated blood to tissues throughout the body. The wall of an artery has three layers: 1  adventitia, the outermost layer, which is primarily connective tissue that gives the artery its FLEXIBILITY. The body\u2019s largest artery is the aorta, which carries blood from the heart to the network of arteries that then carry the blood throughout the body. Fibrous sheaths enclose most of the body\u2019s arteries, usually along with the companion VEIN and NERVE."}, {"url": "http://www.articlesbase.com/diseases-and-conditions-articles/cardiovascular-system-blood-vessels-4882533.html", "passage_text": "Intima is the inner most layer that comprise the artery wall.
