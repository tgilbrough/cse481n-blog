Botulism spores may also be found in undercooked food, corn syrup and even maple syrup. For this reason, feeding an infant any of these foods is risky as well. http://wikiparenting.parentsconnect.com/... Food sources Sources of botulism spores include undercooked food, light and dark corn syrup, maple syrup, and honey. In fact, botulinum can appear in other sweeteners, such as maple syrup, as well as corn syrup. Botulinum can even be found in dust, indicating that it is an extremely widespread toxin. As a result, most humans adapt to it and are able to fend off small amounts of the toxin, such as those present in honey."}, {"url": "http://realmaplesyrup.com/how.html", "passage_text": "Many gallons of sap are needed to make just one gallon of maple syrup. It can range from 35-50 gallons of sap, depending on how much maple sugar there is in the sap. All maple syrup has the same amount of maple sugar, but the maple flavor can be different as we shall learn. The sap is collected into a large holding tank and from there is fed into the sugar house (the place where the magic happens!)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_syrup", "passage_text": "In Canada, syrups must be made exclusively from maple sap to qualify as maple syrup and must also be at least 66 percent sugar.
