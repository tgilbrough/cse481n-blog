The posterior horn of the lateral ventricle in the monkey brain varies in size in different individuals. In this part of the ventricle, the ependymal cells bear cilia, microvilli, microblebs and supraependymal, axon-like cell processes. Only slight differences are seen in the different parts of the posterior horn: The roof has densely packed cilia and microvilli."}, {"url": "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00219662", "passage_text": "The medial wall shows no regional differences.
