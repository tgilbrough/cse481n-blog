The Schlieffen Plan (German: Schlieffen-Plan, [\u0283li\u02d0f\u0259n pla\u02d0n]) was adopted as Aufmarsch I (Deployment [Plan] I) in 1905 (later Aufmarsch I West) and modelled a Franco-German war, which would not involve Russia but was expected to include Italy and Austria-Hungary as German allies. A decisive first campaign would lead to the defeat of France. Helmuth von Moltke the Younger succeeded Schlieffen in 1906 and became convinced that an isolated Franco-German war was impossible, given the Franco-Russian solidarity shown during the Moroccan Crises (1905 and 1911) and Bosnian Crisis (1908)."}, {"url": "http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-one/causes-of-world-war-one/the-schlieffen-plan/", "passage_text": "The Schlieffen Plan was the operational plan for a designated attack on France once Russia, in response to international tension, had started to mobilise her forces near the German border. The execution of the Schlieffen Plan led to Britain declaring war on Germany on August 4th, 1914. In 1905, Schlieffen was chief of the German General Staff. Europe had effectively divided into two camps by this year \u2013 Germany, Austria and Italy (the Triple Alliance) on one side and Britain, France and Russia (the Triple Entente) on the other. This would allow Germany time (the six weeks that Schlieffen had built into his plan) to transfer soldiers who had been fighting in the successful French campaign to Russia to take on the Russians. Schlieffen also planned for the attack on France to go through Belgium and Luxemburg. Belgium had had her neutrality guaranteed by Britain in 1839 \u2013 so his strategy for success depended on Britain not supporting Belgium. The Schlieffen Plan was revised as tension in Europe increased"}, {"url": "http://www.johndclare.net/causes_WWI4.htm", "passage_text": "And the Schlieffen Plan did not allow for a situation like that in 1914.
