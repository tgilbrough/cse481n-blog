I took the Hep A vaccine and then six months later took a booster and it supposedly lasts for life. But you have to get the booster. I read that Hep B vaccine is similar. Here's some more info that I pulled out of an article: Both the vaccines for hepatitis A and the vaccines for hepatitis B are highly effective. In studies of the four vaccines used for hepatitis A, nearly 100% of all adults who receive one develop protective levels of antibodies within one month of receiving a single dose. Results are similar for the hepatitis B vaccine, and experts estimate that both vaccines will give immunity for up to 20 or 30 years and possibly for life. As with all medications, there is the potential for side effects. But the safety record of both vaccines is outstanding"}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/how-does_5230566_long-hepatitis-vaccine-last_.html", "passage_text": "A vaccination for both hepatitis A and B can be given to those ages 18 and older; however, this vaccination is administered in three doses over six months.
