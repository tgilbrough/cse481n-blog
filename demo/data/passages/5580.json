Behaviorism (also called the behaviorist approach) was the primary paradigm in psychology between 1920 to 1950 and is based on a number of underlying assumptions regarding methodology and behavioral analysis: * Psychology should be seen as a science. Watson (1913) stated that \u201cpsychology as a behaviorist views it is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science. Its theoretical goal is \u2026 prediction and control\u201d (p. 158). * Behaviorism is primarily concerned with observable behavior, as opposed to internal events like thinking and emotion."}, {"url": "http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Behaviorist+psychology", "passage_text": "behaviorism. school of psychology which seeks to explain animal and human behavior entirely in terms of observable and measurable responses to environmental stimuli.
