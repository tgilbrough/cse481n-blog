HIV belongs to the retrovirus family, a group of viruses that have the ability to use cells' machinery to replicate (make more copies of the infecting virus). The HIV virus attacks T-helper cells, or CD4+ cells, by fitting itself into the cell like a key in a lock. Once it has invaded, it can use its own RNA as a template to make copies of itself, multiplying and traveling through the body."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV", "passage_text": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, semen, vaginal fluid, pre-ejaculate, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells. HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system such as helper T cells (specifically CD4 + T cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells"}, {"url": "http://www.thebody.com/h/what-pathogenic-organism-causes-hiv.html/", "passage_text": "...first recognized in 1981 and has since become a major worldwide pandemic.

If HIV is outside the body, its capsid disintegrates very quickly which instantly 'disarms' the virus. That is why infection is virtually impossible without direct blood-to-blood contact or through the mixing of body fluids containing the virus. This DNA then becomes part of the infected cell's genetic material. HIV is a 'slow' type of virus that falls into the category of lentiviruses. Lentiviruses are called slow viruses because they take a long time to cause damage to the body. See image 1."}]
