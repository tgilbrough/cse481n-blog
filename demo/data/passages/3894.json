It provides the matrix that sustains the body\u2019s structure. Collagen\u2019s main function is to sustain tendons, skin and cartilage. It provides integrity, firmness and elasticity to their structures. Maximizing collagen levels will keep skin supple."}, {"url": "http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/COL1A1", "passage_text": "The COL1A1 gene provides instructions for making part of a large molecule called type I collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support many tissues in the body, including cartilage, bone, tendon, skin, and the white part of the eye (the sclera). Type I collagen is the most abundant form of collagen in the human body. The COL1A1 gene produces a component of type I collagen called the pro-\u03b11(I) chain. Collagens begin as procollagen molecules, which must be processed by enzymes outside the cell to remove extra protein segments from their ends."}, {"url": "http://www.fasebj.org/content/19/7/716.full", "passage_text": "In conclusion, it is likely that collagen XVIII affects BM function in several ways and that a lack of these functions is apparent in specific tissues that are frequently affected through mutations in ECM components, such as in Bruch\u2019s membrane."}, {"url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15857886", "passage_text": "Collagen XVIII is a component of basement membranes (BMs) with the structural properties of both a collagen and a proteoglycan. Proteolytic cleavage within its C-terminal domain releases a fragment, endostatin, which has been reported to have anti-angiogenesis effects."}]
