Each of these glands secretes one or more different hormones in the blood for different functions. The secretions of endocrine glands are known as hormones. Endocrine glands of human body are divided into two categories; 1) Typical endocrine glands, 2) Organs having secondary endocrine function. 1) TYPICAL ENDOCRINE GLANDS: These glands have primary function of producing hormones for human body.
