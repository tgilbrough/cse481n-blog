It is difficult to separate from other rare earth elements. Isolation: praseodymium metal is available commercially so it is not normally necessary to make it in the laboratory, which is just as well as it is difficult to isolate as the pure metal. This is largely because of the way it is found in nature. The lanthanoids are found in nature in a number of minerals."}, {"url": "http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/pr.htm", "passage_text": "Praseodymium is usually found only in two different kinds of ores. The major commercial ores in which praseodymium is found are monazite and bastnasite. The main mining areas are China, USA, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. Reserves of praseodymium are estimated to be around 2 million tonnes. World production of praseodymium is about 2500 tonnes per year. Praseodymium can be used as alloying agent with magnesium to create high strenght metals that are used in aircraft engines. Praseodymium is one of the rare chemicals, that can be found in houses in equipment such as colour televisions, fluorescent lamps, energy-saving lamps and glasses."}, {"url": "http://www.webelements.com/praseodymium/geology.html", "passage_text": "Praseodymium is never found in nature as the free element.

Praseodymium is a soft, silvery, malleable and ductile metal in the lanthanide group. It is valued for its magnetic, electrical, chemical, and optical properties. It is too reactive to be found in native form, and when artificially prepared, it slowly develops a green oxide coating. In the 1930s it was found (Beck) that praseodymium dioxide could be precipitated from KOH/NaOH eutectic melts, by oxidation by electrochemistry, or by sodium chlorate. This formed the basis of a small-scale laboratory purification method. The relatively pure free metal itself was not prepared until 1931."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Who_discovered_Praseodymium", "passage_text": "The person who discovered Praseodymium is Carl Auer, Freiherr Von Welsbach.
