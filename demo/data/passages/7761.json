If a circle is one, then the premise residing over this question is not in regard to the number of sides the octagon has but how it relates to the circle. Darth Vader \u00b7 6 years ago. Thumbs up."}, {"url": "http://condor.depaul.edu/slueckin/inscribereg1.html", "passage_text": "Polygons are closed plane figures whose edges are straight lines. Polygons are regular if all of their sides and angles are equal. This means that all the corners, or vertices, of a regular polygon will lie on a circle. Usually the simplest method, then, to construct a regular polygon is to inscribe it in a circle. Inscribing an equilateral triangle and a hexagon."}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/maths/geometry/polygonsrev4.shtml", "passage_text": "The formula for calculating the sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon is: (n - 2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 where n is the number of sides of the polygon. This formula comes from dividing the polygon up into triangles using full diagonals. We already know that the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octagon", "passage_text": "A regular octagon is a closed figure with sides of the same length and internal angles of the same size.
