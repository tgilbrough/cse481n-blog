Vesicles can also fuse with other organelles within the cell. Vesicles perform a variety of functions. "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane", "passage_text": "4. Exocytosis: Just as material can be brought into the cell by invagination and formation of a vesicle, the membrane of a vesicle can be fused with the plasma membrane, extruding its contents to the surrounding medium. The deformation then pinches off from the membrane on the inside of the cell, creating a vesicle containing the captured substance. Endocytosis is a pathway for internalizing solid particles (cell eating or phagocytosis), small molecules and ions (cell drinking or pinocytosis), and macromolecules."}, {"url": "http://www.origin-of-mitochondria.net/?p=179", "passage_text": "(1999) list the following: Mitochondria resemble bacteria in size and morphology.

The mitochondrial outer membrane can associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, in a structure called MAM (mitochondria-associated ER-membrane). The matrix is the space enclosed by the inner membrane. It contains about 2/3 of the total protein in a mitochondrion.

In endocytosis, molecules that are too large to be transported by other means are engulfed by an invagination of the cell membrane and carried into the cell surrounded by a vesicle. Exocytosis is the reverse of endocytosis. "}]
