The same technique is used to transfer genes (DNA) for production of insulin, growth hormones, and other proteins into bacteria. 1 The plasmid DNA used in the laboratory has a gene for ampicillin resistance. 2  The plasma DNA is obtained from the supplier in a concentrated solution, which has to be diluted to 0.005 ug/ul for the DNA transformation experiment. 3  The DNA should be distributed to the students in tubes kept on ice."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111027072434AAXyQyL", "passage_text": "Best Answer: It confers ampicillin resistance to the cell that has the plasmid carrying the amp^r gene. The gene works by encoding a subunit of the enzyme, beta lactamase, that breaks down ampicillin. This subunit combines with a subunit already present in the bacterial cells to form a working enzyme which breaks down the ampicillin and allows the bacteria to survive. The enzyme responsible for degrading ampicillin is called beta-lactamase, in reference to the beta-lactam structure of ampicillin and related drugs Antibiotic resistance is an important tool for genetic engineering."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_purpose_of_an_ampicillin_resistance_gene_in_cloning", "passage_text": "Split and merge into it. Answer by Acid36. Confidence votes 5.0K. The ampicillin resistance gene (AmpR) is called a selectable marker gene and is incorporated into several plasmids that are commonly used in a wide range of genetic engineering and molecular biology experiments.
