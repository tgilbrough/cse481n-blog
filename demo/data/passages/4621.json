You can't really go swimming without a tampon because you don't want your blood in the pool/beach etc. There are tampons that are comfy such as Playtex Sport tampons. They also have tampons that are slender which is easier to insert. This is a bit embarrassing-I have had this holiday with my friends planned for ages which is starting Sunday. We organised it specially so we could go swimming and to the beach nearly every day, but literally just this afternoon I noticed that I was on my period."}, {"url": "http://www.wikihow.com/Swim-when-You-Are-on-Your-Period", "passage_text": "Insert a tampon or a menstrual cup before swimming. Though swimming can temporarily reduce your menstrual flow, it's not sanitary for you to go in the water with your friends without inserting a tampon or a menstrual cup first. If you're not comfortable with these items yet, you should try using them at home before you go swimming. Though some girls are nervous about swimming on their periods, you shouldn't let your menstrual cycle prevent you from enjoying a day at the beach or pool with your friends. In fact, getting some exercise while swimming with your period can help you reduce cramps and improve your mood."}, {"url": "https://malaysia.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100315062216AAgLxt8", "passage_text": "Pads can be used for swimming, but commercial pads like Always or organic pads like Cottons will go soggy in the water and come unstuck so use cloth pads or something similar, you can only use cloth pads like Lunapads for swimming. you can still wear a tampon when swimming, and its probably best if you still have your period as you are not yet familiar to how long your period lasts."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090512235311AAs42yv", "passage_text": "Report Abuse. Your period doesn't stop when you go swimming but that is what it will look like. When you swim your period blood is deluted so much you can't see it. If you sit out on the side of the pool you might be able to see it, so try to stay in the water (personal experience). Good luck! Hope I helped! No, your period does not stop when you go swimming. It may seem lighter but this is only because the water dilutes your menstrual flow \u2013 that's why so many girls think their periods do stop in water.
