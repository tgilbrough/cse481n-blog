You can also borrow from your RRSP to finance education for yourself or spouse through the Lifelong Learning Plan. The LLP allows you to borrow up to $10,000 a year, up to a total of $20,000.

In the first year, you must withdraw 7.38% from the RRIF, Diamond notes. Now, let's say Bob also has a $500,000 RRSP. He deferred withdrawing from his RRSP until he converted it to a RRIF at age 71. The mandatory 7.38% means he must withdraw $36,900 in the year he turns 72. That significantly increases Bob's taxable income to $87,900, which moves him to a higher tax bracket."}]
