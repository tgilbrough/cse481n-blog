Some early icebox-size watermelons, of 2 to 4 pounds, Early Midget, Garden Baby, Golden Midget and Little Baby Flower, mature in 65 to 70 days. Planting Watermelons. The ideal date to plant watermelons varies according to the climate of the region. To produce the sugar necessary for sweet fruit, the melons need hot weather. Seedlings should not be transplanted until three to four weeks after the last average frost date in the spring."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/info_8492397_long-watermelon-germination.html", "passage_text": "All seedless watermelons are hybrids and take the longest time to mature. The seeds germinate between seven and 14 days and they must be kept between 75 and 85 degrees. It's also necessary to plant seedless watermelons next to seeded watermelons, as the hybrid varieties need a pollinator. For a healthy seedling to sprout, watermelon seeds must be planted in temperatures between 70 and 95 degrees. Position the seeds no more than 5 feet away from each other, so the seedlings have room to mature into large fruit."}, {"url": "http://homeguides.sfgate.com/tricks-tips-germinate-watermelon-seeds-67335.html", "passage_text": "Boosting the soil's fertility levels before planting watermelon seeds ensures quick germination and seedling establishment. For the best results with watermelons, use 3 pounds of 5-10-10 fertilizer for every 100 square feet of planting space. Simply scoop the seeds out of a watermelon, rinse them under water to remove any fruit pieces or fruit juices, and let them air-dry on a paper towel. In general, watermelon seeds stay viable for approximately four years. However, the longer you wait, the lower your chances of optimal germination."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/info_8492397_long-watermelon-germination.html", "passage_text": "Conditions for Germination. Watermelon seeds need nutrient-rich soil and lots of water to germinate and thrive, as over 90 percent of the fruit is made of water. Adding mulch will help the soil retain its moisture and reduce weed growth. For a healthy seedling to sprout, watermelon seeds must be planted in temperatures between 70 and 95 degrees.

Cover pots with plastic wrap and place in a warm room to germinate---approximately 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Check daily for sprouts and to ensure the potting mix is still moist. Watermelons usually take 7 to 14 days to germinate but check seed package for exact timing for the variety you are growing. Watermelons require a long, hot summer in order to reach maturity. In the areas with short summers, start watermelon seeds indoors and transplant outside after all danger of frost has passed. In areas with a long summer watermelon can be started right in the garden bed."}, {"url": "http://www.agrisupportonline.com/Articles/germinating_watermelone_seeds.htm", "passage_text": "Seed storage Watermelon seed will last 3 - 4 years when kept dry (10 - 15% seed moisture content), and at cool, constant temperatures (14 - 20 c). Seed packaging opened too long before sowing, and frequent and rough handling will lower watermelon seed viability. top of page. In this article, seed dormancy, germination, and seedling propagation of watermelon seed will briefly be addressed. Seed Germination Germination is a complex physiological process with photo-dependency, initiated by water absorption during a period of optimum temperatures."}, {"url": "http://homeguides.sfgate.com/tricks-tips-germinate-watermelon-seeds-67335.html", "passage_text": "Boost Temperatures. The warmer the soil, the faster watermelon seeds germinate.
