Prions are highly resistant to disinfectants, heat, ultraviolet radiation, ionizing radiation and formalin. However, prions can be deactivated by heat, by chemicals and by a combination of heat, chemicals, pressure and time. A commercial disinfectant called Environ LpH also has been shown to be effective at deactivating prions. Prion disinfection occurs with a 1 percent solution of LpH for 10 hours or with a 10 percent LpH solution for one hour."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_can_you_kill_prions", "passage_text": "Confidence votes 68. You can inactivate them, not kill them. They are technically not alive. Think of them more like a substance, a protein to be exact. household bleach will inactivate prions if left in a bleach/water solution for at least 30 minutes. the directions for this are under the prions topic on Wikipedia. Prions are not eukaryotic. In fact, prions aren't even alive. They are merely an infectious protein, like a virus or a viroid.

Taylor DM(1). Author information: (1)Neuropathogenesis Unit, Institute for Animal Health, Edinburgh, UK. Prions are very resistant to inactivation, and accidental transmission has occurred through the use of inadequate decontamination procedures. Strong sodium hypochiorite solutions achieve inactivation but other chlorine-releasing compounds are less effective. 2M sodium hydroxide leads to substantial but incomplete inactivation; other chemical procedures such as the use of proprietary phenolic disinfectants are much less less effective."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Can_you_deactivate_prions", "passage_text": "Prions A prion is an infectious protein that is misfolded.
