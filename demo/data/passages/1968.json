You'll have to file a gift tax return (by April 15 of the next year), and you'll use up $6,000 of the total amount you can give away or leave free from estate tax.

Taxable gifts are those to one recipient in excess of $12,000 per year. (Gift recipients never pay taxes on gifts). If you are married and have at least one child, each of your parents could gift each of the three of you $12,000 a year, or $72,000 in all, without it being taxable. If you are married but have no children, your parents can give you and your wife only $48,000 in non-taxable gifts in any one year.
