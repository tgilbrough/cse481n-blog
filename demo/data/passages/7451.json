An agonist is a chemical that binds to a receptor and activates the receptor to produce a biological response. Whereas an agonist causes an action, an antagonist blocks the action of the agonist and an inverse agonist causes an action opposite to that of the agonist. Inverse agonists exert the opposite pharmacological effect of a receptor agonist, not merely an absence of the agonist effect as seen with antagonist. An example is the cannabinoid inverse agonist rimonabant. A co-agonist works with other co-agonists to produce the desired effect together."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100307125821AAWaMwY", "passage_text": "Agonists are chemical substances that mimic or enhance the effects of neurotransmitters on the receptor sites of the next cell. If the neurotransmitter was excitatory, the effect of the agonist would be to increase the inhibitory. the agonist blockst the inhibitory effect. Antagonist drugs are chemical substances that block or reduce a cell's response to the action of other neurotransmitters.

Receptors can be activated by either endogenous (such as hormones and neurotransmitters) or exogenous (such as drugs) agonists, resulting in a biological response. A physiological agonist is a substance that creates the same bodily responses but does not bind to the same receptor. Inverse agonists exert the opposite pharmacological effect of a receptor agonist, not merely an absence of the agonist effect as seen with antagonist.
