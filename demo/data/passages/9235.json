Since the soils in southern Alberta are low in N-fixing bacteria, alfalfa seed must be inoculated with the R. meliloti. Alfalfa seed is often pre-inoculated before sale.

There is no great trick to learning how to use alfalfa meal. The amount you use is important, but it\u2019s more likely that you won\u2019t use enough rather than using too much. Sprinkle about 2 cups of the meal around rose bushes or other shrubs of that size. Work the alfalfa meal into the soil with a rake, then water the plants as usual. Do the first application in the spring, when your plants begin to show new growth. Those plants that only bloom once in the year don\u2019t need any more meal added."}]
