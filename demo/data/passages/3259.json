In vehicles that are turbocharged or supercharged, the MAP sensor also reads the amount of boost pressure. The MAP sensor has a vacuum tube attached to the intake manifold and a vacuum or calibrated pressure area. Between them is a silicon chip that flexes due to the pressure difference between the two areas."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070704032303AA9WZK6", "passage_text": "Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Actually manifold pressure is the Difference between the air pressure (or vacuum) inside the intake manifold and the relative atmospheric pressure of the air around the engine. Without a supercharger or turbocharger, both of which force more air into the intake manifold, the maximum manifold pressure is the ambient pressure around the airplane, with a slight loss due to the throttle plate."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070704032303AA9WZK6", "passage_text": "Report Abuse. Manifold pressure is the absolute atmospheric pressure in the intake manifold of the engine. It may either be below (vacuum) or above (tubocharged / supercharged) than ambient air pressure. Without a supercharger or turbocharger, both of which force more air into the intake manifold, the maximum manifold pressure is the ambient pressure around the airplane, with a slight loss due to the throttle plate."}, {"url": "http://www.aa1car.com/library/map_sensors.htm", "passage_text": "HOW A MAP SENSOR WORKS. MAP sensors are called manifold absolute pressure sensors rather than intake vacuum sensors because they measure the pressure (or lack thereof) inside the intake manifold. When the engine is not running, the pressure inside the intake manifold is the same as the outside barometric pressure. But the MAP sensor doesn't care because it just monitors the absolute pressure inside the intake manifold. On engines with a speed-density electronic fuel injection system, airflow is estimated rather than measured directly with an airflow sensor."}, {"url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq4szm5Re0g", "passage_text": "What is a MAP sensor?

In other words, it literally reads the pressure inside the induction system. In normally aspirated engines (non turbo-charged), the manifold pressure gauge has a range of anwhere between 10 \u2013 40 in. hg (or inches of mercury). In a turbocharged engine, the manifold pressure is allowed to go as high as the engine manufacturer allows."}]
