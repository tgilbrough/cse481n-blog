Two ratings are applied to aviation gasolines (the lean mixture rating and the rich mixture rating) which results in a multiple numbering system e.g. Avgas 100/130 (in this case the lean mixture performance rating is 100 and the rich mixture rating is 130)."}, {"url": "http://www.csgnetwork.com/avgas.html", "passage_text": "Avgas is gasoline fuel for reciprocating piston engine aircraft and is not to be confused with jet fuel.
