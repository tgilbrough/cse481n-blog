Some of the most impressive of the creatures that live here are the giant tube-worms. Deep Sea Hydrothermal Vents.

But in fact, they are unlike any other life on Earth. Instead of sunlight, vent life relies on hydrogen sulfide-more commonly known as rotten egg gas and toxic to most land-based life. Until recently, all life on Earth was believed to be dependent on the sun. But in the last 30 years, several new deep-sea ecosystems have been discovered that utilize an alternative source of energy. Deep-sea hydrothermal vents form as a result of volcanic activity on the ocean floor."}, {"url": "http://www.seasky.org/deep-sea/hydrothermal-vents.html", "passage_text": "Science had discovered deep-sea hydrothermal vents. These vents occur in geologically active regions of the ocean floor. Within these regions, seawater seeps down deep into the Earth's crust through cracks and fissures in the ocean floor. This water is then heated by magma below the surface. As the water is heated to a boil, it expands and rises back to the surface.

Relative to the majority of the deep sea, the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents are biologically more productive, often hosting complex communities fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids. A black smoker or sea vent is a type of hydrothermal vent found on the seabed, typically in the abyssal and hadal zones. They appear as black, chimney-like structures that emit a cloud of black material."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent", "passage_text": "A hydrothermal vent is a fissure in a planet's surface from which geothermally heated water issues.

Scientists are exploring several possible locations for the origin of life, including tide pools and hot springs. However, recently some scientists have narrowed in on the hypothesis that life originated near a deep sea hydrothermal vent. The chemicals found in these vents and the energy they provide could have fueled many of the chemical reactions necessary for the evolution of life. "}]
