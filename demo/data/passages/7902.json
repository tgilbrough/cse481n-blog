As moisture is absorbed back into the wood, the grain expands again, and the cracks may disappear. Wood is a porous material, and while wood flooring is sealed with a protective coating, the surface beneath it is not. As a result, the wood naturally expands and contracts with humidity and other moisture. Splits are most commonly caused by this natural movement.

It doesn't happen often, but moisture changes or excessive dryness in the environment of a wood floor can cause one of the boards to split. It's usually possible to fix a split by spreading glue inside it and closing it with a clamp. In a floor, however, the edges of the board aren't exposed, so there's no place for the clamp.
