Geologically, the term \u201cdruse\u201d is used when there are fine crystals that cover certain rocks or form at the core or near the veins. From the term \u201cdruse\u201d, any rock coated with fine crystals or jewelry piece that resemble the same is called druzy or drusy. The fine layer of crystals that form in various rocks are secondary to years of exposure to various natural elements like gases that get trapped within them."}, {"url": "http://www.ebay.com/gds/What-is-Druzy-Quartz-Gemstone-Where-It-Found-/10000000019755573/g.html", "passage_text": "Please sign in to vote on this Guide.
