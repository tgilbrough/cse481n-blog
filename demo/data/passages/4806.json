Grapevines grow as quickly to maximize the amount of sunlight they can absorb, and thereby maximize the amount of food they can produce for themselves. A vine, once planted, can grow to appear quite mature inside of a single season. Thirty feet or more of vine in one year's growth is not unheard of. Just because a grapevine can fruit, however, doesn't mean it should fruit. Second-year grape clusters are grown at the expense of your vine expanding its root system, and should be snipped off early in the season to allow the vine to focus its resources on bulking up its root stock."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071119132142AA5N0n4", "passage_text": "Report Abuse.

Once established, with proper care grape vines can live and produce grapes for 50 to 100 years. So plant the vines in the right spot, because it disrupts their growth to move them. The first several years after grape vines are planted they do not produce fruit. During those first few years grape vine\u2019s root structure grows and the vine develops strong and numerous branches to hold all those grapes it eventually produces. But do not expect to see any grapes until at least the third year. In addition, it takes about five to six years for grapevines to begin producing a consistent, heavy crop of grapes. But the wait is worth it -- one mature vine can produce 10 lbs. or more of fresh grapes per season.

This is also why neglected vines don't produce many grapes. Pruning. Pruning is one of the most important factors in grape production. Grapes develop only on new growth, which sprouts from 1-year-old wood. This is one reason why most vines don't produce grapes in their second year -- the whole plant is only 1 year old, so its main job is support instead of grapes."}, {"url": "http://homeguides.sfgate.com/long-grape-vines-produce-grapes-56962.html", "passage_text": "Most grapevines give you fruit in their third season.
