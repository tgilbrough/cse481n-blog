That is why there are no trees on the tundra. Even though the tundra has no trees, many other types of plants do grow on the tundra. For example, there are shrubs, grass, lichens and mosses. These are small plants which do not have deep roots"}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/tundra-biome-climate-locations-plants-animals.html", "passage_text": "Although there are few trees in the tundra, there is a variety of smaller vegetation that grows in this environment. Plants that are commonly found in the tundra biome include dwarf shrubs, grasses, mosses and lichens. Overall, the tundra biome is a unique and formidable environment with cold temperatures, low precipitation and high winds. Although these harsh conditions make the tundra a difficult environment to survive in, there are some plants and animals that have adapted to these conditions."}, {"url": "http://www.cotf.edu/ETE/modules/msese/earthsysflr/tundraP.html", "passage_text": "Plants also have adapted to the Arctic tundra by developing the ability to grow under a layer of snow, to carry out photosynthesis in extremely cold temperatures, and for flowering plants, to produce flowers quickly once summer begins. A small leaf structure is another physical adaptation that helps plants survive. Only plants with shallow root systems grow in the Arctic tundra because the permafrost prevents plants from sending their roots down past the active layer of soil. The active layer of soil is free from ice for only 50 to 90 days."}, {"url": "http://tundrabiomee.weebly.com/plants-and-animals.html", "passage_text": "One of the most common plants in the Tundra are lichen. Lichen is a decomposer made of plants and fungus working together. Lichen can live in the Tundra because they can be close to the ground and can have short roots.

In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. In physical geography, tundra is type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term tundra comes through Russian \u0442\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 from the Kildin Sami word t\u016bndar t\u016bnd\u00e2r, uplands treeless mountain. tract"}, {"url": "http://www.ri.net/schools/West_Warwick/manateeproject/Tundra/plant.htm", "passage_text": "Plant Life. The Tundra has a lot of plant life within this biome. Some common plants include the bearberry, arctic moss, Caribou moss, Diamond leaf willow, Labrador Tea, Pasque Flower, and the Tufted Saxifrage.
