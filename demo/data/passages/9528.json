When scouting for deer a good way to find plants that the deer have been eating is to look out for torn vegetation. Deer do not have incisors (front teeth) therefore the vegetation that they graze on often looks ripped when they bite into it. These non woody plants are very important to a deer\u2019s diet especially in the fall. Look for clear cuts, power line and field edges where the grass and brush are often cut back. These areas provide new growth plants which deer love to eat.
