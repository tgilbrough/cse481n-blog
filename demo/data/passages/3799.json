Consider speaking with a landlord-tenant lawyer in your area if you have additional questions or need legal assistance. If the tenant remains after that period, the landlord has to hire the sheriff or marshal to carry out a forcible eviction. That will take several weeks more.

Generally landlords can ask a tenant to leave for cause, or evict without cause in some instances. In eviction without cause, the landlord can, for example, ask a month-to-month tenant to leave at the end of a rental period. The landlord usually can't wait until the day before to do this, however.

The landlord must first formally give 30 days of notice to the tenant. If the tenant does not leave, then the landlord must serve the tenant with a Notice of Petition for eviction. A court date may then be set for 5-12 days after the date of service. At the court hearing, the judge may set a date by which the tenant must vacate the premises.

The tenant is notified of the complaint, then has five days to file a written response. With no written response, the default judgment goes to the landlord. This can be a three-day pay or quit notice, a 30-day vacate notice or a 60-day vacate notice.
