[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax", "passage_text": "Anthrax is an acute disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Most forms of the disease are lethal, and it affects mostly animals. It is contagious and can be transmitted through contact or consumption of infected meat. The lethality of the anthrax disease is due to the bacterium's two principal virulence factors: the poly-D-glutamic acid capsule, which protects the bacterium from phagocytosis by host neutrophils, and the tripartite protein toxin, called anthrax toxin."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax", "passage_text": "Anthrax does not spread directly from one infected animal or person to another; rather, it is spread by spores. These spores can be transported by clothing or shoes. The body of an animal that had active anthrax at the time of death can also be a source of anthrax spores.

Anthrax differs from most bacteria in that they exist in an inactive (dormant) state called spores. The spores are found in soil, animal carcasses and feces (including sheep, goats, cattle, bison, horses, and deer), and animal products (e.g., hides and wool). Bacillus anthracis was discovered in 1850. Notably, it was actually the first bacterium to be shown to cause a disease.

Anthrax is the disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, which lives in soil. The bacterial cell lives as a hardy spore to survive harsh conditions. The spores germinate into thriving colonies of bacteria once inside an animal or person. Cutaneous Anthrax. Cutaneous anthrax is the most common form of the disease. People with cuts or open sores can get cutaneous anthrax if they come in direct contact with the bacteria or its spores, usually through contaminated animal products."}, {"url": "http://www.sfcdcp.org/anthrax.html", "passage_text": "Anthrax disease is a severe illness caused by bacteria named Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax disease can result in pneumonia, blood infection, and death. Most of the time anthrax bacteria live in an inactive form called spores. 1 Lung Anthrax or Pneumonia is the most likely form of disease after an intentional release of anthrax and occurs by breathing in anthrax spores. 2  After exposure, it usually takes 2-7 days (but sometimes up to 2 months) until illness starts."}, {"url": "http://www.medicinenet.com/anthrax/article.htm", "passage_text": "The agent of anthrax is a bacterium called Bacillus anthracis. While other investigators discovered the anthrax bacillus, it was a German physician and scientist, Dr. Robert Koch, who proved that the anthrax bacterium was the cause of a disease that affected farm animals in his community. Ingestion of anthrax can cause serious, sometimes fatal disease. The most deadly form is inhalation anthrax. If the spores of anthrax are inhaled, they migrate to lymph glands in the chest where they proliferate, spread, and produce toxins that often cause death."}, {"url": "http://web.uconn.edu/mcbstaff/graf/Student%20presentations/Banthracis/Banthracis.html", "passage_text": "Bacillus Anthracis.

It can also be diagnosed by measuring specific antibodies in the blood of infected persons. Anthrax is usually spread in the form of a spore.
