After T4 and T3 are made, they are released by the thyroid gland into circulation. This release happens in response to stimulus from a part of your brain called the pituitary that makes a substance called Thyroid Releasing Hormone (TRH). TRH tells the thyroid gland to release thyroid hormones into your blood stream."}, {"url": "http://www.hormone.org/hormones-and-health/what-do-hormones-do/what-does-the-thyroid-gland-do", "passage_text": "Having thyroid hormone levels that are too high (overactive thyroid gland).

When the thyroid produces too little hormone, things in your body can slow down too much. Too Much = Hyperthyroid. When the thyroid produces too much thyroid hormone, it is overactive. The condition is called hyperthyroidism. With hyperthyroidism, all of your major body systems are in overdrive, which can result in a host of unpleasant symptoms, from anxiety to diarrhea."}, {"url": "http://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/thyroid/how-your-thyroid-works", "passage_text": "The function of the thyroid gland is to take iodine, found in many foods, and convert it into thyroid hormones: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid cells are the only cells in the body which can absorb iodine. These cells combine iodine and the amino acid tyrosine to make T3 and T4. Every cell in the body depends upon thyroid hormones for regulation of their metabolism. The normal thyroid gland produces about 80% T4 and about 20% T3, however, T3 possesses about four times the hormone strength as T4."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid", "passage_text": "Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, the most common cause being Graves' disease \u2014an autoimmune disorder.
