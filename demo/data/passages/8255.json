When combined with glucose (monosaccharide), through a condensation reaction, the result is the disaccharide lactose. The hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose is catalyzed by the enzymes lactase and \u03b2-galactosidase. The latter is produced by the lac operon in Escherichia coli"}, {"url": "http://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-glucose-and-galactose", "passage_text": "Galactose is a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet compared to glucose. It is a C-4 epimer of glucose. Epimers are diastereomers that differ in configuration of only one stereogenic center. The galactose in the body is usually a result of a polymer galactin which converts into galactose through hydrolysis. It has four isomers and is a hexose monosaccharide. It differs from glucose due to the way the \u2013OH is located in the fourth carbon.

Lactose is a disaccharide sugar derived from galactose and glucose that is found in milk. Lactose makes up around 2\u20138% of milk (by weight), although the amount varies among species and individuals, and milk with a reduced amount of lactose also exists. Lactose is a disaccharide derived from the condensation of galactose and glucose, which form a \u03b2-1\u21924 glycosidic linkage. Its systematic name is \u03b2-."}]
