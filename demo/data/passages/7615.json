The player makes this column of air vibrate by buzzing the lips while blowing air through a cup or funnel shaped mouthpiece. The tuba is used a lot in marches and other compositions where it is important to have a strong beat. Made of about 16 feet of tubing, the tuba is the largest and lowest sounding member of the brass family. The tuba uses valves and its cup shaped mouthpiece to change pitches."}]
