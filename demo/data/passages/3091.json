Nephrons are microscopic tube-like structures in the kidneys that filter the blood and cause wastes to be removed.

Glomerular filtration is a process in which water and some other substances in the blood plasma pass from the capillaries of the glomerulus into the Bowman's capsule.

The nephron (from Greek \u03bd\u03b5\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 - nephros, meaning kidney) is the basic structural and functional unit of the kidney. Its chief function is to regulate the concentration of water and soluble substances like sodium salts by filtering the blood, reabsorbing what is needed and excreting the rest as urine.

Blood entering the nephron is filtered through a cluster of capillaries called the glomerulus. The filtrate then enters the renal tubule, along which a complex process of secretion and reabsorption occurs. Useful substances such as glucose are reabsorbed; the acidity of the blood is regulated; and water levels are adjusted. The resulting fluid is called urine.
