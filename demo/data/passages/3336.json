Scripts can be made quite short but also easily readable. And the built-in tabling is really cool for speeding up recursive programs.

Piccata translates to piquant or piquancy, which in one definition means tart or zesty. This dish does have a tart sauce, with traditional additions of lemon juice, white wine and capers. The chicken is then dredged in a mixture of flour, salt, and pepper, and the excess flour should be dusted off. In a medium heat pan, the chef should cook the thin slices of chicken very quickly, about a minute to two on each side. Overcooking the meat can ruin the dish."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccata", "passage_text": "Piccata (also picatta, pichotta) is a method of preparing food: meat is sliced, coated, sauteed saut\u00e9ed and served in a.
