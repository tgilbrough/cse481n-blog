The information is in DNA by means of the nucleotides A, T, G, and C which can be read by other proteins to and transcribed into mRNA which is then translated into functioning proteins."}, {"url": "http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/cellular-microscopic/dna4.htm", "passage_text": "\u00adDNA carr\u00adies all of the information for your physical characteristics, which are essentially determined by proteins. So, DNA contains the instructions for making a protein. In DNA, each protein is encoded by a gene (a specific sequence of DNA nucleotides that specify how a single protein is to be made)."}, {"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090315093145AAJu88E", "passage_text": "DNA is the 'blueprint' to create, maintain and then reproduce the species in which it is carried. The genetic code is the order of four bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. Usually these are converted into another molecule similar to DNA called messenger RNA by a process called transcription."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_type_of_information_does_DNA_carry", "passage_text": "A nucleus of a cell contains chromosomes that carry genetic  information.

This sequence is encoded in the DNA where one gene encodes for one protein. The genetic code consists of 3-base words or codons that specify particular amino acids."}]
