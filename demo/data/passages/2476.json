Wireless networks typically work in one of two configurations (sometimes called topologies): ad-hoc or infrastructure. The topology or mode you choose depends on whether you want your PCs to communicate directly or with an access point. Wireless networks that use an access point are in infrastructure mode (Figure 3.4). Figure 3.4. More common than an ad-hoc network, an infrastructure network includes an access point. An infrastructure network enables you to: Connect to a wired network."}, {"url": "http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/WLAN-adhoc-mode-vs-infrastructure-mode.html", "passage_text": "WLAN adhoc mode vs infrastructure mode-Difference between adhoc mode and infrastructure mode. In Wireless LAN (WLAN) there are two system entities viz. Access Point(AP) and Stations(STAs). Stations are nothing but simple NICs(network interface cards). In infrastructure mode, wlan network is composed of stations as well as one or more access points(APs). The device Access Point is like base station used in cellular system.
