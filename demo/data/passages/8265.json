The best time to plant your corn seeds is when the soil temperature reaches an average of 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

That's kind of a magic number, 50 degrees, for planting corn, observes Jim Fawcett, an Iowa State University Extension field agronomist in eastern Iowa. That's when corn will germinate, with a soil temperature of 50 degrees or higher. The reason for not planting before that is the seed actually will take up water with soil temperatures cooler than 50 degrees. The seed will swell, but it doesn't germinate."}, {"url": "http://homeguides.sfgate.com/temperature-should-ground-plant-corn-55128.html", "passage_text": "Corn seeds are most likely to germinate when they are planted at a depth of approximately 1 to 2 inches. Inserting your soil thermometer into the soil at the depth you plan to plant provides an accurate measurement of how warm the soil is at that depth."}]
