Serum is the liquid part of your blood. There are a number of reasons why a doctor may order this test. One is to test for a cancer called multiple myeloma; another is to screen for multiple sclerosis, a chronic disease of the nervous system. SPEP is used to help diagnose or monitor a variety of different diseases or disorders that have abnormal proteins or protein levels. Electrophoresis is not usually used by itself to diagnose a disease. Instead, it is used along with other laboratory tests to provide more information to help with diagnosis"}, {"url": "http://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/0101/p105.html", "passage_text": "Serum protein electrophoresis is used to identify patients with multiple myeloma and other serum protein disorders. Electrophoresis separates proteins based on their physical properties, and the subsets of these proteins are used in interpreting the results. Serum is placed on a specific medium, and a charge is applied. The net charge (positive or negative) and the size and shape of the protein commonly are used in differentiating various serum proteins. 1.

Protein electrophoresis separates proteins based on their size and electrical charge. This forms a characteristic pattern of bands of different widths and intensities on a test media and reflects the mixture of proteins present in the body fluid evaluated."}, {"url": "http://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/0101/p105.html", "passage_text": "Serum protein electrophoresis is a laboratory examination that commonly is used to identify patients with multiple myeloma and other disorders of serum protein.

Protein electrophoresis also tests for other proteins and immunoglobulins. The presence of M proteins can be a sign of a type of cancer called myeloma, or multiple myeloma. Myeloma affects white blood cells called plasma cells in the bone marrow. The protein electrophoresis test is also used to diagnose other conditions affecting the plasma cells.
