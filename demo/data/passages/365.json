Gonadotropins are injectable fertility drugs which contain follicle stimulating hormone, or FSH, luteinizing hormone, or LH, or both.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), also known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and luliberin, as well as gonadorelin (INN), is a trophic peptide hormone responsible for the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. At the pituitary, GnRH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of the gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). These processes are controlled by the size and frequency of GnRH pulses, as well as by feedback from androgens and estrogens."}, {"url": "https://www.asrm.org/Side_Effects_of_Injectable_Fertility_Drugs_Gonadotropins_factsheet/", "passage_text": "Gonadotropins are fertility medications given by injection that contain follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) alone or combined with luteinizing hormone (LH). When FSH (with or without LH) is given as an injection, it works directly on the ovaries to make multiple follicles (cysts containing eggs).

LH and FSH are heterodimers consisting of two peptide chains, an alpha chain and a beta chain. LH and FSH are secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, while hCG and eCG are secreted by the placenta in pregnant humans and mares, respectively.
