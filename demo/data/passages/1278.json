For example, a blood pressure of 120 over 80 yields one of 40 mm Hg (120 minus 80 = 40). Obviously it is the difference between the systolic and the diastolic pressures. Let's call it PP. Thus there are three components to this (or any other) blood pressure reading: Systolic pressure (120), diastolic pressure (80) and pulse pressure (40)."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/facts_4813452_normal-pulse-rate-blood-pressure.html", "passage_text": "heart pulse image by jim from Fotolia.com. Normal pulse rate and blood pressure are two of the leading indicators of an individual's physical health. Pulse is defined as the number of times a person's heart beats per minute, and is often measured at the neck, temple, wrist, back of the knee or inside of the foot.

Normal blood pressure is a systolic pressure of less than 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and a diastolic pressure of less than 80 mm Hg, or 120/80 mm Hg, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Having a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg is considered high blood pressure or hypertension. A blood pressure level between normal and hypertension, is called prehypertension, meaning it is higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered hypertension."}, {"url": "http://www.healthcentral.com/high-blood-pressure/c/58370/110775/pulse", "passage_text": "Pulse pressure refers to the difference between the systolic (top) and diastolic (bottom) blood pressure.

This is the ideal blood pressure for people wishing to have good health. At this level, we have a much lower risk of heart disease or stroke. If your blood pressure is optimal, this is great news. If your blood pressure is above 120/80mmHg, you will need to lower it. Most adults in the UK have blood pressure readings in the range from 120 over 80 (120/80) to 140 over 90 (140/90). If your blood pressure is within this range, you should be taking steps to bring it down or to stop it rising any further. Our five top tips will show you how"}]
