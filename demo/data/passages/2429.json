X-rays have smaller wavelengths and therefore higher energy than ultraviolet waves. We usually talk about X-rays in terms of their energy rather than wavelength. This is partially because X-rays have very small wavelengths. It is also because X-ray light tends to act more like a particle than a wave. "}, {"url": "http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro.html", "passage_text": "Gamma rays, x-rays, and some ultraviolet waves are ionizing, meaning these waves have such a high energy that they can knock electrons out of atoms. Exposure to these high-energy waves can alter atoms and molecules and cause damage to cells in organic matter. Electromagnetic energy travels in waves and spans a broad spectrum from very long radio waves to very short gamma rays. The human eye can only detect only a small portion of this spectrum called visible light. A radio detects a different portion of the spectrum, and an x-ray machine uses yet another portion."}, {"url": "http://www.livescience.com/50215-gamma-rays.html", "passage_text": "View full size image. Gamma-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, as are radio waves, infrared radiation, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and microwaves. Gamma-rays can be used to treat cancer, and gamma-ray bursts are studied by astronomers.

X rays and gamma rays are short wavelength electromagnetic waves (with properties equivalent to light). All the various waves shown below are electromagnetic waves and related to light.

The only difference is the frequency and hence the energy of those photons. Gamma rays are generally the most energetic of these, although a broad overlap with X-ray energies occurs. Gamma rays typically have frequencies above 10 exahertz 19 Hz), and therefore have energies above 100 keV and wavelengths less than 10 picometers (10 \u221212 meter), which is less than the diameter of an atom. However, this is not a hard and fast definition, but rather only a rule-of-thumb description for natural processes."}]
