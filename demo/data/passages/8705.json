Magma can be forced into rocks, blown out in volcanic explosions or forced to the surface as lava. The atoms and molecules of melted minerals are what make up magma. Tuff is a rock formed from volcanic ash. The upper section of the Earth's crust is made up of around 95% igneous rock.

Igneous rocks are also formed when volcanoes erupt. Igneous rocks are formed as the lava cools above ground. The upper 16 km of the Earth\u2019s crust is composed of 95% igneous rock.

Igneous rock may form with or without crystallization, either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks. This magma can be derived from partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100323143106AAB5sdj", "passage_text": "\u00b7 just now.

These are known as extrusive igneous rocks because they are formed outside of the crust. There are about 700 different types of igneous rock. More examples of igneous rocks include tuff, diorite and andesite. Here are some uses of igneous rocks: Granite is used for building and construction because of its strong properties. It is also used for head stones and kitchen counter tops."}]
