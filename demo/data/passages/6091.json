As I already explained, how much money an Uber driver makes depends on numerous factors.

But to qualify for this bonus (or the $30/hour guarantee in effect at the time I drove), drivers must accept at least 90 percent of the hails they receive. I got lucky. I drove at a time when Lyft was guaranteeing new drivers that they'd make at least $30 per hour if they drove 50 hours in one week.
