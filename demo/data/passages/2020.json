It plays a different role in every type of eukaryotic cell. Its primary function is that of serving as a site for enzyme action and storing various ions and enzymes for cellular functions."}, {"url": "http://biology.about.com/od/cellanatomy/ss/endoplasmic-reticulum.htm", "passage_text": "The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of tubules and flattened sacs that serve a variety of functions in the cell. There are two regions of the ER that differ in both structure and function. One region is called rough ER because it has ribosomes attached to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The other region is called smooth ER because it lacks attached ribosomes. Typically, the smooth ER is a tubule network and the rough ER is a series of flattened sacs."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/In_a_cell_what_is_the_function_of_the_endoplasmic_reticulum", "passage_text": "There are tow types of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): Smooth ER and Rough ERSmooth ER-Breaks down carbohydrates; synthesis of lipids, phospholipids, steroids; helps to detoxify \u2026 blood; stores Calcium ionsRough ER-Helps with protein synthesis; has ribosomes it acts as an intracellular highway through the cell."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum", "passage_text": "The general structure of the endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes called cisternae. These sac-like structures are held together by the cytoskeleton. The phospholipid membrane encloses a space, the cisternal space (or lumen), which is continuous with the perinuclear space but separate from the cytosol."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_endoplasmic_reticulum", "passage_text": "Endoplasmic reticulum is a network of tubules, vesicles and sacs that are interconnected. They may serve specialized functions in the cell including protein synthesis, sequestration of calcium, production of steroids, storage and production of glycogen, and insertion of membrane proteins."}, {"url": "http://biology.about.com/od/cellanatomy/ss/endoplasmic-reticulum.htm", "passage_text": "Since the ER is connected with the nuclear envelope, the lumen of the ER and the space inside the nuclear envelope are part of the same compartment. The rough endoplasmic reticulum manufactures membranes and secretory proteins. In certain leukocytes (white blood cells), the rough ER produces antibodies."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/In_a_cell_what_is_the_function_of_the_endoplasmic_reticulum", "passage_text": "Technical Answer: The endoplasmic reticulum has two parts to it. The Rough ER has many Ribosomes lining its inside and creates proteins for the cell which are either used or sent to the Golgi Apparatus for transportation. Proteins that are created in the Rough ER have a higher chance of being secreted."}, {"url": "http://bscb.org/learning-resources/softcell-e-learning/endoplasmic-reticulum-rough-and-smooth/", "passage_text": "Ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum are called \u2018membrane bound\u2019 and are responsible for the assembly of many proteins. This process is called translation. Certain cells of the pancreas and digestive tract produce a high volume of protein as enzymes."}]
