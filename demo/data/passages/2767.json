Only T4 that is unattached or \u201cfree\u201d can get into your cells to go to work. A blood test can measure how much free T4 is available. Hypothyroidism Tests: A Measure of Treatment Success.

Guide. A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) blood test is used to check for thyroid gland problems. TSH is produced when the hypothalamus releases a substance called thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH then triggers the pituitary gland to release TSH. TSH causes the thyroid gland to make two hormones: triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). T3 and T4 help control your body's metabolism. Triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are needed for normal growth of the brain, especially during the first 3 years of life. How To Prepare. Tell your doctor if you have had any tests in which you were given radioactive materials or had X-rays that used iodine dye within the last 4 to 6 weeks. Your test results may not be correct if you have had iodine contrast material before having a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test. 1 | 2 | 3 | 4."}, {"url": "http://www.stopthethyroidmadness.com/lab-values/", "passage_text": "Second, if you have Hashimoto\u2019s, you lab results can swing between hypo and hyper, & your lab test may be representing the middle of the swing. The best way to use the TSH lab test is in diagnosing a pituitary problem, not a thyroid problem. A very low TSH with a low free T3 gives away a pituitary issue.
