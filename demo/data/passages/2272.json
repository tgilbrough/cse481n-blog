The xylem and phloem carry water and nutrients throughout a plant while the veins and arteries carry blood in a body.

Plant veins are also sturdy enough to act as a support system and keep leaves open for photosynthesis -- the process through which plants make food. Plants have a vascular system throughout their roots and stems, but the system's veins are most visible in leaves."}, {"url": "http://blogs.egusd.net/eettalfonso/2011/05/24/25-describe-comparecontrast-xylemphloem-veinsarteries/", "passage_text": "The xylem & phloem & the veins and arteries both carry nutrients and minerals from the plant and animals. Like the xylem moves water and minerals up from the roots. Some of the water is stored in the vacuoles as water moves up the plant."}]
