In the case of hot deserts the temperature range from highs of 43.5 to 49\u00b0 C to minimum temperatures down to -18\u00b0 C. The hottest ever recorded was 57.8\u00b0 C.

The average rainfall is about one inch of rain. The soil is rocky and shallow. The Semiarid Desert The semiarid desert's average temperature in the summer is 110.3 to 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

They typically receive less than 30 cm of rain per year. The driest deserts often receive less than 2 cm of rain per year. Temperatures in the desert are extreme. Because of the lack of moisture in the air, heat quickly dissipates as the sun sets. In hot deserts, the temperatures can range from above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the day to below 32 degrees Fahrenheit at night. Cold deserts generally receive more rainfall than do hot deserts. In cold deserts, temperatures in winter range between 32-39 degrees Fahrenheit with occasional snowfall."}, {"url": "http://deserttawanbanyatpiyaphod.weebly.com/climate.html", "passage_text": "Hot Deserts Hot deserts temperature can raise up to 50 degrees Celsius but the average temperature of 30 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius.
