When a retrovirus infects a cell, it makes a DNA copy of its genome that is inserted into the DNA of the host cell. There are a variety of different retroviruses that cause human diseases, including the common cold, some forms of cancer, and AIDS. It uses an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to become part of the host cells' DNA. This allows many copies of the virus to be made in the host cells.

A retrovirus is any virus which copies itself as part of the cell's DNA by reverse transcribing its RNA.
