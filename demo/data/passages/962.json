Oaks, maples, and elms are deciduous trees. Coniferous trees are trees that produce seeds without fruits or nuts. Most coniferous trees bear seeds in cones, have needles instead of broad leaves, and keep their needles in winter. Coniferous trees are also called gymnosperms, evergreens, or softwoods. Spruces, firs, and pines are coniferous. During the growing season, the cells in the cambium divide to make new xylem and phloem. In spring they divide quickly and add a thick, light-colored layer"}, {"url": "http://www.wikihow.com/Prune-Conifers", "passage_text": "Conifers are trees and shrubs that have needle-type leaves and produce cones instead of flowers. Conifer trees have only one main \u201cleader\u201d or trunk that extends all the way to the top. Conifer shrubs can be short, medium or tall with a more rounded shape, or they can be low ground-cover types like \u201cBlue Rug\u201d junipers. Regardless of whether the conifer is a tree or shrub, they are generally pruned in the same way"}, {"url": "http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/about/habitat_types/habitats/coniferous_forests/", "passage_text": "Unusually for coniferous trees they are deciduous, that is they shed their leaves in winter.

Use these tips to identify coniferous trees: Pines and larches have needles in clusters of two, three, five or more.

One of the most notable adaptations of conifer trees are the presence of needle-like leaves. These leaves are adapted to survive in harsher and colder conditions compared to broad leaves. The needle-like leaves are an important adaptation to Conifer trees because they do not accumulate much snow, keeping the weight load mild.
