The fly is cast using a fly rod, reel, and specialized weighted line. Casting a nearly weightless fly or  lure  requires casting techniques significantly different from other forms of casting. Spey casting is a casting technique used in fly fishing. Spey casting requires a longer, heavier two-handed fly rod, referred to as a Spey rod.

Begin with your fly line in front of you and cast it back. Anglers may have a personal preference between a sidearm, 45 degree, or overhead cast. Each is useful in its own situation, but start with the casting angle most comfortable to you while learning. 1 As you let more line out of the rod, you add more load. 2  The process is very similar to the length of a whip determining its potential energy load. 3  When done correctly, the torque of your cast combined with the flex in the fly rod will sail the heavier fly line out, carrying the fly with it."}, {"url": "http://www.wikihow.com/Fly-Cast", "passage_text": "1. Strip off about 20 feet (6 meters) of line from the tip of the rod and lay it in front of you. While in the other forms of casting, you're casting a bait or lure, in fly casting, you cast the line in a manner similar to cracking a whip with a weighted tip. 1 If, even with practice, you find using a fly rod too difficult, you can also cast flies using ultralight spinning gear and water-weighted bobbers. 2  Use the casting techniques described in How to Cast Spinning Tackle.."}, {"url": "http://www.wikihow.com/Cast-a-Fly-Fishing-Rod", "passage_text": "Fly rods are much more flexible than spinning rods.

It uses a simple reel that hangs down from the bottom end of a long, whip-like rod and holds a weighted line to cast artificial flies to catch trout, salmon and other fish. 1 If, even with practice, you find using a fly rod too difficult, you can also cast flies using ultralight spinning gear and water-weighted bobbers. 2  Use the casting techniques described in How to Cast Spinning Tackle.."}, {"url": "http://www.bishfish.co.nz/webbooks/smttrout/castflyrod1.htm", "passage_text": "How to cast a fly-fishing rod-Part 1. The sport of fly-fishing could perhaps better be called fly-casting-because you can do a lot of casting per fish hooked. You will do a great deal more casting if you have not learned to find fish to cast to. Learning to cast properly and accurately is absolutely essential if you plan to catch trout using fly-fishing gear"}, {"url": "http://www.wikihow.com/Cast-a-Fly-Fishing-Rod", "passage_text": "5. Stop when the rod tip is still pointing slightly upward. Stopping with the rod tip in an upward position gives the fly line more height and room to roll out in front of you. 1  Casting the rod tip too far forward will sink the rolling line too low, possibly allowing it to contact the ground or water before unfurling. 1 As you let more line out of the rod, you add more load. 2  The process is very similar to the length of a whip determining its potential energy load. 3  When done correctly, the torque of your cast combined with the flex in the fly rod will sail the heavier fly line out, carrying the fly with it."}]
