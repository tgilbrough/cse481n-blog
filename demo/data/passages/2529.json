Burning garbage or throwing waste into landfills produces byproducts that pollute the environment. Runoff from landfills and metals like mercury find their way into streams, rivers and oceans, fish, and eventually into human beings, harming our health. It takes less energy to create new items from recycled materials than it does to create new products from raw materials. Mining minerals and milling trees into lumber requires vast amounts of energy."}, {"url": "http://thegogreenblog.com/is-recycling-good-for-the-environment/", "passage_text": "Recycling has always been encouraged as a way to help the environment, but it also has its downfalls. One problem that many people focus on with recycling are the emissions from the increasing amount of trucks used to pick up recycling. However, this is not an established problem. Another issue of recycling is the amount of energy used. Wood products, petroleum and aluminum all require a lot of energy to refine and reuse, which is why consumption should be reduced. However, when aluminum is bought it is better to recycle it than throw it away."}, {"url": "http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/Publications/Documents/Economics%5C41004002.pdf", "passage_text": "Q. How is recycling good for the environment? A. Each year recycling:\u2022 Saves enough energy to power 1.4 million California homes.\u2022 Reduces water pollution by 27,047 tons. \u2022 Saves 14 million trees. A large, growing part of that sector is recycling and recycling-related businesses. The ability to bring new life to used materials has become more than just good environmental stewardship; it has become big business."}, {"url": "http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/Importance_of_Recycling.php", "passage_text": "Recycling is important in today\u2019s world if we want to leave this planet for our future generations.
