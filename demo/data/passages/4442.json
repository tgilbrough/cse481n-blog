Most cases of tinnitus are subjective, but occasionally the tinnitus can be heard by an examiner. Otologic problems, especially hearing loss, are the most common causes of subjective tinnitus. Common causes of conductive hearing loss include external ear infection, cerumen impaction, and middle ear effusion. Patients with vascular abnormalities complain of pulsatile tinnitus. Arterial bruits may be transmitted to the ear from arterial vessels near the temporal bone.

But even if BART's noise isn't a hearing hazard, it can be annoying. People can be irritated by 70 decibels or 80 decibels, Howarth said.
