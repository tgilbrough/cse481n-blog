Cranial cavity: Contains the brain. Spinal portion: Contains the spinal cord, which is an extension of the brain. Ventral cavity: Anterior surface of torso; divided by diaphragm muscle into upper thoracic cavity and abdominopelvic cavity."}, {"url": "http://wp.pierce.ctc.edu/blog/nmouatrich/files/2010/05/1-1-notes.doc", "passage_text": "2. The dorsal body cavity is the space that houses the central nervous system, and has two subdivisions: the cranial cavity and the vertebral cavity. a. The cranial cavity is within the skull, and houses the brain. b. The vertebral, or spinal, cavity is within the vertebral column, and houses the spinal cord. 3. The ventral body cavity is anterior to and larger than the dorsal cavity and has two main subdivisions: the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity."}, {"url": "http://philschatz.com/anatomy-book/contents/m45990.html", "passage_text": "Subdivisions of the Posterior (Dorsal) and Anterior (Ventral) Cavities. The posterior (dorsal) and anterior (ventral) cavities are each subdivided into smaller cavities. In the posterior (dorsal) cavity, the cranial cavity houses the brain, and the spinal cavity (or vertebral cavity) encloses the spinal cord. Just as the brain and spinal cord make up a continuous, uninterrupted structure, the cranial and spinal cavities that house them are also continuous."}, {"url": "http://www.funnelbrain.com/c-701628-six-body-cavities-do-they-house.html", "passage_text": "The Dorsal cavity-houses organs along the posterior(back aspect of the body). The Cranial cavity: houses the brain. The Spinal cavity: houses the spinal cord. Ventral cavity-houses organs along the anterior (front) aspect of the body."}]
