It is the loosely bound cofactor to an enzyme. Cofactors are chemical compounds that are bound to proteins. A cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound, while a coenzyme is a non-protein molecule. It is important to understand that, in our body, enzymes are very important."}, {"url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Enzyme/Cofactors", "passage_text": "Coenzyme [edit]. A coenzyme is a small, organic, non-protein molecules that carries chemical groups between enzymes. It is the cofactor for the enzyme and does not form a permanent part in the enzyme's structure. Sometimes, they are called cosubstrates and are considered substrates that are loosely bound to the enzyme."}]
