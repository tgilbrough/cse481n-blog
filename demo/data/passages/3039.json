The human body secretes and circulates some 50 different hormones. A wide variety of these chemical substances are produced by endocrine cells, most of which are in glands. The hormones then enter the blood system to circulate throughout the body and activate target cells. Some of these substances then act on the other endocrine glands. Unlike substances produced by the exocrine glands, which flow through ducts, the hormones are released directly into the space that surrounds them by secreting cells."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_are_three_types_of_chemical_messengers", "passage_text": "Covalent-Strongest (Split up into polar and nonpolar) Ionic Hydrogen-Weakest Three types of chemical bonds include the ionic bond, the covalent bond, and metallic bond.

There are three kinds of chemical messengers in the nervous system: Neurotransmitters, endorphins and hormones. 1) Neurotransmitters are released by transmitting neurons. They alter the activity of the receiving neurons. Note that neurotransmitters exist outside of the nervous system as well. I believe they are called chemical messengers because of their function and the fact it is a chemical. They travel through the blood and target cells respond to hormones often \u2026 because of their structure."}]
