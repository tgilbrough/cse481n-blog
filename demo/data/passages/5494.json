Some of the harmful types of bacteria are those which can cause disease or adversely affect one's health, and these include: Mycobacteria, which are rod-shaped, and neither Gram-positive nor Gram-negative microorganisms that can cause infections of the lungs, skin and other parts of the body. In general most of these bacteria consist of: Lactobacilli, which are rod-shaped, Gram-positive bacteria normally found in the human intestine, vagina and mouth.

They include bacteria, fungi, and archaea. The main bacterial inhabitants of the stomach include: Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, Peptostreptococcus, and types of yeast.

Bacteria are generally classified as either helpful or harmful. Bacteria can be found everywhere, and appear on every surface and every part of the human body. The helpful bacteria are those commonly found in yogurt and in the making of cheeses, and are good for the intestinal tract. Type #1: Streptococcus Pyogenes. The streptococcus pyogenes is the bacteria responsible for many of the common human diseases seen today, including mild skin infections and sore throats. The bacterium is spherical shaped, growing in chains and existing in the human body where the temperature is right for its growth."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiome", "passage_text": "The human skin contains microbes that reside either in or on the skin and can be residential or transient.Resident microorganism types vary in relation to skin type on the human body. A majority of bacteria reside on superficial cells on the skin or prefer to associate with glands.
