A compass points north because all magnets have two poles, a north pole and a south pole, and the north pole of one magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet. (You may have seen this demonstrated by a pair of simple bar magnets or refrigerator magnets pushed end to end.). A magnet is what makes a compass point north -- the small magnetic pin in a compass is suspended so that it can spin freely inside its casing and respond to our planet's magnetism."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_points_on_the_compass_called", "passage_text": "if your facing north, the compass needle will point to the N on you compass, along with south (S), west (W) and east (E). also, northeast(NE), southeast(SE), northwest (NW), s \u2026 outhwest(SW).

When the compass is used, the rose can be aligned with the corresponding geographic directions, so, for example, the N mark on the rose really points to the north. Frequently, in addition to the rose or sometimes instead of it, angle markings in degrees are shown on the compass. A magnetic compass points to magnetic north pole, which is approximately 1,000 miles from the true geographic North Pole. A magnetic compass's user can determine true North by finding the magnetic north and then correcting for variation and deviation."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_of_the_compass", "passage_text": "The points of the compass are points on a compass, specifically on the compass rose, marking divisions of the four cardinal directions: North, South, East, West. The number of points may be only the 4 cardinal points, or the 8 principal points adding the intercardinal (or ordinal) directions northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NW). In meteorological usage further intermediate points are added to give the sixteen points of a wind compass"}, {"url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Trigonometry/Compass_Bearings", "passage_text": "The four cardinal points on a compass, which split the circumference of the compass into four equal parts, are (going clockwise) N orth, E ast, S outh and W est.

True north is the direction from a point to the north pole of the Earth's rotation axis. It may be determined by observations of the stars, especially (in the Northern hemisphere) Polaris, \u03b1 Ursae Minoris. A magnetic compass points along the Earth's magnetic field.
