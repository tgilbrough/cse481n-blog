The percentage saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen determines the content of oxygen in our blood. After the human body reaches around 2,100 m (7,000 feet) above sea level, the saturation of oxyhemoglobin begins to plummet. Mountain medicine recognizes three altitude regions that reflect the lowered amount of oxygen in the atmosphere: 1  High altitude = 1,500\u20133,500 metres (4,900\u201311,500 ft). 2  Very high altitude = 3,500\u20135,500 metres (11,500\u201318,000 ft). 3  Extreme altitude = above 5,500 metres ("}, {"url": "http://www.liver.ca/liver-disease/having-liver-disease/healthy-living-guidelines/sodium-guidelines.aspx", "passage_text": "Most Canadians consume far more sodium than is needed.
