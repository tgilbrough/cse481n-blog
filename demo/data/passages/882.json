It's been performed by everyone from Andy Griffith to Kanye West. Today I made a contribution to the continuing BPP series, Best Song in the World Today, with the classic spiritual  I'll Fly Away .. The choice was inspired by the jarring experience of going from the Grand Canyon to Las Vegas last weekend."}, {"url": "http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=6509", "passage_text": "Now We May Begin was produced by The Crusaders, and this song (as well as Street Life) was written by their keyboard player Joe Sample with lyrics by Will Jennings, who told us: 'One Day I'll Fly Away' was written specifically for Randy Crawford.
