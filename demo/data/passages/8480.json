The roots of the word literally mean \u201cgood breathing.\u201d If a patient has eupnea, it means that the respiration is not a cause for concern. Patients who have difficulty breathing are assessed to determine why so that appropriate treatments can be offered. No obstructions are present to limit the flow of air or make the breathing noisy and the patient doesn't experience tightness, pain, or other symptoms in the chest that might make breathing difficult. Eupnea is also steady, with a regular respiratory rate."}, {"url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569904803001927", "passage_text": "Therefore, eupnea can qualify the breathing patterns most adapted to normal environmental constraints, which are the most commonly observed in vivo. It is distinct from other respiratory patterns that are induced by sudden changes in the environment, such as polypnea that may follow moderate hypoxia or hyperthermia. Respiratory neuronal networks in vertebrates appear to be able to generate a variety of rhythmic patterns in vivo, leading to the biological diversity of eupneic patterns as well as to life-threatening dyspneic patterns."}, {"url": "http://www.audioenglish.org/dictionary/eupnea.htm", "passage_text": "Hypernyms (eupnea is a kind of...): breathing; external respiration; respiration; ventilation (the bodily process of inhalation and exhalation; the process of taking in oxygen from inhaled air and releasing carbon dioxide by exhalation).
