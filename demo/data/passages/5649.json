Along with the various other inventions Mesopotamia is well known for the unique and an important invention of the wheels. The wheels were invented by the Sumerians around 3500 BC. The wheel is a cylinder shaped object that rolls fairly easily. The first wheel was made from clay, rock and mud which slowly developed to the making of wheels by joining together of wooden planks.

In the Iron Age, it was controlled by the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian Empires.

This period was known as the Bronze Age, which is a relatively late chapter in the story of the development of human civilisation. One of these is the wheel.
