[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basophilic", "passage_text": "Basophilic is a technical term used by histologists. It describes the microscopic appearance of cells and tissues, as seen down the microscope, after a histological section has been stained with a basic dye. The most common such dye is haematoxylin. Different definitions will apply to basophilic: Basophilic stains are acidic stains called base loving stains. Basophilic substances are base loving cells. Basophilic substances attract basic dyes, such as haematoxylin; Eosin is referred to as an basophilic stain. Simplistically, acid pH stains (positive charge) are attracted to the base pH tissue (negative charge), so they are called basophilic stains"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basophilic_stippling", "passage_text": "Basophilic stippling aka Punctate basophilia refers to an observation found when observing a blood smear in which erythrocytes display small dots at the periphery. These dots are the visualization of ribosomes and can often be found in the peripheral blood smear, even in some normal individuals.
