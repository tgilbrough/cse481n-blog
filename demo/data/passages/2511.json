Because many adenomas have a mixture of both growth patterns, some polyps may be called tubulovillous adenomas. Most adenomas that are small (less than \u00bd inch) and have a tubular growth pattern. Larger adenomas may have a villous growth pattern. Larger adenomas are more often found to have cancers developing in them.

While colon polyps are a very common condition, especially among the elderly population, adenoma polyps are associated with a risk of turning malignant and increase the risk of development of colon cancer. A tubular adenoma polyp is a tube like structure which comprises of 75% of the epithelium and is arranged in a tubular fashion. Though this type of polyp is at the lowest risk of turning malignant; however its risk of turning malignant increases as the size of the polyp increases."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_polyp", "passage_text": "Neoplastic polyps of the bowel are often benign hence called adenomas. An adenoma is tumor glandular tissue, that has not (yet) gained the properties of a cancer. The common adenomas of the colon (colorectal adenoma) are the tubular, tubulovillous, villous, and sessile serrated (SSA). As is evident from their name, sessile serrated and traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs) have a serrated appearance and can be difficult to distinguish microscopically from hyperplastic polyps. A colorectal polyp is a polyp (fleshy growth) occurring on the lining of the colon or rectum. Untreated colorectal polyps can develop into colorectal cancer."}, {"url": "http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/GIHTML/GI066.html", "passage_text": "A small adenomatous polyp (tubular adenoma) is seen here.
