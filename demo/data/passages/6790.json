Releasing hormones synthesized by hypothalamic neurons travel down axons and diffuse into the primary plexus of the hypophyseal portal system. It does not produce its own hormones, but only stores and releases the hormones created by the hypothalamus, whereas the anterior pituitary produces and secretes its own hormones.

There are also some hormones that are produced by the hypothalamus and then stored in the posterior pituitary gland prior to being released into the bloodstream.

One set sends the hormones they produce down through the pituitary stalk to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland where these hormones are released directly into the bloodstream. These hormones are anti-diuretic hormone and oxytocin. You are here: Hypothalamus. Print | Email article to a friend | Last updated: January 21, 2015. The hypothalamus is a part of the brain that has a vital role in controlling many bodily functions including the release of hormones from the pituitary gland."}, {"url": "https://askabiologist.asu.edu/bird-hypothalamus", "passage_text": "This is called maintaining homeostasis. The hypothalamus also maintains homeostasis in lots of other ways, such as by controlling your blood pressure. The hypothalamus also controls many of your hormones. It does this by being a sort of gatekeeper for other glands that release hormones. When your hypothalamus senses a change in your body, it will tell the right gland how to help correct that change. The hypothalamus does many things, but two of its most important jobs are to maintain homeostasis and to control certain hormones. Homeostasis is very important to all animals, including humans. If we look at the word, we see that homeo means \u201cthe same\u201d, and stasis means \u201cnot moving\u201d, or \u201cholding\u201d."}]
