Centripetal force is a force on an object directed to the center of a circular path that keeps the object on the path. It's value is based on three factors: 1) the velocity of the object as it follows the circular path; 2) the object's is distance from the center of the path; and 3) the mass of the object."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force", "passage_text": "where is the centripetal acceleration.

The centripetal force is the force that causes an object to move in a circle, acting towards the centre of the circle.
