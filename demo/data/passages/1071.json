Cyanosis is a term used to describe a bluish tint to your skin, as well as your fingernails and fingertips. It is a condition caused by not having enough oxygen in your blood. In people with light skin, such as Caucasians, this is quite distinctive. Many of the health conditions that cause cyanosis are the result of abnormalities in the blood, lungs, or heart. Blood abnormalities may make it difficult for the blood to absorb oxygen.
