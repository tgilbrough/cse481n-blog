The digestive system is a group of organs (Buccal cavity (mouth), pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, liver, gall bladder, jejunum, ileum and colon) that breakdown the chemical components of food, with digestive juices, into tiny nutrients which can be absorbed to generate energy for the body. "}, {"url": "http://www.newhealthadvisor.com/The-Digestive-System-and-Body-Metabolism.html", "passage_text": "The digestive system is responsible for breaking down the food and drink we consume into usable substances and, transferring them into energy for our body; as well as for cell growth and repair. It consists of a network of organs working harmoniously to achieve the task. On top of harnessing the substances we consume, the digestive system is also responsible for excreting waste from the body. Metabolism is the process that your body uses to convert the food and drink that you consume into energy. The digestive system and body metabolism work together to ensure that your body is consistently and efficiently energized to carry out normal day-to-day tasks, as well as background bodily functions.

Best Answer: 1 The digestive system is the group of organs that breaks down food so that the body can use it. Food must be broken down all the way to its individual molecules to be useable. This involves a number of steps, and different organs to do different parts of the job. 3 The digestive process begins in the mouth. There, the teeth and the muscles of the mouth begin the digestive process by breaking down the food into smaller bits. Saliva, produced by the salivary glands, begins to digest the food before it is even swallowed."}, {"url": "http://www.studymode.com/essays/Discuss-The-Physiology-Of-The-Three-1144736.html", "passage_text": "The digestive system is a group of organs that breakdown the chemical components of food, with fluid (digestive juices) into tiny nutrients which can be absorbed to generate energy.
