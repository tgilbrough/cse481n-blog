Magma (from Greek \u03bc\u03ac\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1, thick unguent) is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intrusion into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock."}, {"url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UciJ1aYWch8", "passage_text": "A volcano is a vent or 'chimney' that connects molten rock (magma) to the Earth's surface.

The temperature of this hot fluid ranges from 1292 - 2372 \u00b0F. At this temperature, it has the ability to melt the surrounding rock structures to produce more magma. \u274d Intermediate magma contains 60 percent silica, but the magnesium and iron content in it is very low.

Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption and the resulting rock after solidification and cooling. This molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid at temperatures from 700 to 1,200 \u00b0C (1,292 to 2,192 \u00b0F)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma", "passage_text": "Magma is a complex high-temperature fluid substance.
