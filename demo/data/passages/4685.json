The utilization of arsenic compounds in industrial and commercial products is being slowly phased out, to a great extent due to the high toxicity of Arsenic and its compounds and the evidence that certain exposure can cause cancer."}, {"url": "http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/water/arsenic/arsenic-and-water.htm", "passage_text": "Acute toxicity is generally higher for inorganic arsenic compounds than for organic arsenic compounds. Oral intake of more than 100 mg is lethal. The lethal dose of arsenic trioxide is 10-180 mg, and for arsenide this is 70-210 mg. The mechanism of toxicity is binding and blocking sulphur enzymes."}, {"url": "http://chemsee.com/poison-detection/poison-detection-resources/chemnote-arsenic-poisoning/", "passage_text": "However, as long as the Arsenic is in the body, it will continue to cause physiological damage. Exposure to small doses of Arsenic compounds over a long period of time can result in lung, skin or liver cancer, or cancer of the lymphatic system. Damage to organs, such as the esophagus, can cause speaking difficulties. Exposure to small doses of Arsenic may also cause confusion and disorientation."}]
