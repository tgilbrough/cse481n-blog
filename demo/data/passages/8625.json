The petroleum geologist must stay focused on the porosity and permeability of the prospective reservoir. Porosity. Porosity of a rock is a measure of its ability to hold a fluid. Mathematically, porosity is the open space in a rock divided by the total rock volume (solid + space or holes). Porosity is normally expressed as a pecentage of the total rock which is taken up by pore space."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentary_rock", "passage_text": "Particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment. Before being deposited, sediment was formed by weathering and erosion in a source area, and then transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, ice, mass movement or glaciers which are called agents of denudation.

This may vary according to the samples, e.g. some sandstones may have a mixture of grain sizes and may have poor permeability. Permeable sandstone underground can store water (or oil and gas). Impermeable slate can be used on roofs of buildings to keep the water out. Impermeable rocks can also be used as facing stones on buildings or gravestones, and nice-looking ones (eg. granite) are used for kitchen work surfaces."}, {"url": "http://www.kgbanswers.com/what-is-an-example-of-a-sedimentary-rock-that-is-porous-but-not-permeable/10654359", "passage_text": "Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock that can have high porosity, yet can be nearly impermeable due to the poorly interconnected voids.

Each grain in the rock is made from a mineral, which is a chemical compound. The grains in a rock can be different colours, shapes and sizes. Granite has interlocking grains. Sandstone has rounded grains. Some types of rock have interlocking grains that fit tightly together. Granite is a rock with interlocking grains."}, {"url": "http://www.esta-uk.net/index_htm_files/porosity_permeability-a~-veronica_bull.doc", "passage_text": "POROSITY AND PERMEABILITY. Pore spaces are important because they can hold oil and gas, water for water supplies and deposits of hydrothermal minerals. The amount of pore space in a rock is called its. porosity. Volume of pore space. Porosity = ----------------------------------- x 100. Total volume of rock. Clay in particular loses porosity through this process, whilst sandstone often lose porosity as calcite and silica minerals grow in the pore spaces.
