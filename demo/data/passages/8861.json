If we want to work out a b of a number n. First we divide n by the denominator b (n \u00f7 b). How to find a fraction of a number. Here are the two easy steps for finding the fraction of a number: Step 1 - Find the unit fraction of the number by dividing the number by the denominator. Step 2 - Multiply by the numerator. You should have now found your fraction of a number! Examples. Example 1) Find 5 6 of 24. Step 1). A unit fraction is a fraction where the numerator is equal to 1. To find the unit fraction of a number, you need to divide the number by the denominator"}, {"url": "http://classroom.synonym.com/fraction-number-2676.html", "passage_text": "A fraction is defined as the expression a/b, where a and b are integers. In the fraction a/b, a is the numerator and b is the denominator. Find the fraction of an integer. You can calculate the fraction of a whole number by multiplying the number by the numerator and dividing that product by the denominator. Thus, the fraction a/b of a whole number x is given by ax/b. Calculate the fractions of an integer for specific cases. For example, \u00be of 21 is (3x21)/4 or 63/4"}, {"url": "http://www.wikihow.com/Find-Equivalent-Fractions", "passage_text": "Divide the numerator and denominator by the same number. Like multiplication, division can also be used to find a new fraction that's equivalent to your starting fraction. Simply divide the numerator and the denominator of a fraction by the same number to obtain an equivalent fraction. There is one caveat to this process--the resulting fraction must have whole numbers in both the numerator and denominator to be valid. 1  For instance, let's look at 4/8 again. 1 Converting fractions to equivalent forms is actually a form of multiplying them by 1. 2  In converting 1/2 to 2/4, multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2 is the same as multiplying 1/2 by 2/2, which equals 1. 3  If desired, convert mixed numbers to improper fractions to make converting easier."}, {"url": "http://www.mathgoodies.com/lessons/fractions/equivalent.html", "passage_text": "You can multiply the numerator and the denominator of a fraction by any nonzero whole number, as long as you multiply both by the same whole number!

Multiplying the numerator and the denominator of a fraction by the same nonzero whole number will change that fraction into an equivalent fraction, but it will not change its value.
