Android is unique because Google is actively developing the platform but giving a portion of it away for free to hardware manufacturers and phone carriers who want to use Android on their devices. Google only charges manufacturers if they also install the Google apps portion of the OS. To use Android on a phone, you generally need a data plan on top of your voice plan. Some networks in the US offer tiered data service, and some offer unlimited plans.
