The cerebral cortex is divided into four sections, called lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe. Nerve cells make up the gray surface of the cerebrum which is a little thicker than your thumb. White nerve fibers underneath carry signals between the nerve cells and other parts of the brain and body. The neocortex occupies the bulk of the cerebrum."}, {"url": "http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/genpsycerebrum.html", "passage_text": "The surface of the cerebrum -- the cerebral cortex -- is composed of six thin layers of neurons, which sit on top of a large collection of white matter pathways. The cortex is heavily convoluted, so that if you were to spread it out, it would actually take up about 2 1/2 square feet (2500 sq cm). The Cerebrum. Dr. C. George Boeree. The cerebrum -- which is just Latin for brain -- is the newest (evolutionarily) and largest part of the brain as a whole.

Surface of the cerebrum. The cerebral cortex, the outer layer of gray matter of the cerebrum, is found only in mammals. In larger mammals, including humans, the surface of the cerebral cortex folds to create gyri (ridges) and sulci (furrows) which increase the surface area. The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. Depending upon the position of the animal it lies either in front or on top of the brainstem.
