Testing of autonomic nervous system function; vasomotor adrenergic innervation (sympathetic adrenergic function), including beat-to-beat blood pressure and R-R interval changes during Valsalva maneuver and at least 5 minutes of passive tilt."}, {"url": "http://peripheralneuropathycenter.uchicago.edu/learnaboutpn/evaluation/autonomic/", "passage_text": "To see if a disease is affecting the autonomic nervous system, several tests are done to monitor blood pressure, blood flow, heart rate, skin temperature, and sweating. By measuring these functions, it is possible to discover whether or not the autonomic nervous system is functioning normally. Tests to measure blood pressure and heart rate include the tilt table test, a deep breathing test and the Valsalva maneuver. The tilt table test requires that the patient lie on a table that is then raised. The deep breathing test requires the patient to take deep breaths for a minute."}, {"url": "http://pcs.hmc.washington.edu/Epilepsy/anstesting.htm", "passage_text": "Clinical autonomic disease and the role of autonomic testing. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is responsible for the homeostatic control of numerous bodily functions such as blood pressure and body temperature regulation, urinary function, pupil size, sweating, sexual function, and digestion.
