For the cell to express a particular gene into a particular protein, it must first attach an enzyme complex to an appropriate spot on one of the organism\u2019s chromosomes. That spot is called the promoter region. A nucleotide base -- a ringed molecule containing nitrogen -- hangs off each sugar group, and it\u2019s the sequence of these bases that contains the genetic code for creating proteins.
