[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramipril", "passage_text": "Ramipril (INN, BAN, USAN) is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and congestive heart failure. By inhibiting an enzyme, ACE inhibitors relax the muscles around small arteries (arterioles). The arterioles expand and allow blood to flow through more easily. The AIRE trial showed a 27% reduction in mortality for patients receiving ramipril for chronic heart failure following a myocardial infarction. Ramipril was found to have similar results as telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker."}, {"url": "http://www.medicinenet.com/ramipril/article.htm", "passage_text": "BRAND NAME: Altace. DRUG CLASS AND MECHANISM: Ramipril belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that are used for treating high blood pressure, heart failure and for preventing kidney failure due to high blood pressure and diabetes. Other ACE inhibitors include enalapril (Vasotec), quinapril (Accupril), captopril (Capoten), fosinopril (Monopril), benazepril (Lotensin), lisinopril (Zestril, Prinivil), moexipril (Univasc) and trandolapril (Mavik). ACE is important because it is an enzyme responsible for producing the chemical, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes muscles in most arteries, including the arteries of the heart, to contract, thereby narrowing the arteries and elevating blood pressure. ACE inhibitors such as ramipril lower blood pressure by reducing the production of angiotensin II, thereby relaxing arterial muscle and enlarging arteries. When the blood pressure is lower, the heart--including the failing heart--does not have to work as hard to pump blood"}, {"url": "http://libraries.mackenziehealth.ca/Medications.aspx?bran_name_id=4613", "passage_text": "Ramipril belongs to the class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
