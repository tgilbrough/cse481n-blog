Continuing the example above, you would multiply 0.167 miles per minute by 60 to get your speed of 10.0 mph.

I'll put it this way IMHO: The average non-cyclist adult on a multi-speed bike will maybe average 9-12 mph as an easy pace-a stroll if you will on flat terrain. Average sport or training cyclists on good road bikes will find that pace painfully slow. A leisurely ride to me is around 14-15 mph. Most ardent cyclists (me included) prefer a moderate ride when not riding hard that's maybe 15-18 mph on a road bike.

Best Answer: You should probably plan on at least 3 weeks and more likely 4. It's not necessarily how fast your average daily speed is but how far you can/want or need to travel. Most organized multi-day bike tours average around 75 miles per day or less with good reason. Everyone goes at their own pace and you may go faster or slower than other people. The best thing you can do especially if you are going to bike 1500 miles is get a speedometer and maybe bike 20 miles on a weekend before you go to find an average speed you can travel that distance at."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/486666-is-an-average-of-15-miles-per-hour-on-a-bike-good-for-a-beginner/", "passage_text": "Is an Average of 15 Miles Per Hour on a Bike Good for a Beginner?

A general rule of thumb is that if you are switching from a mountain bike with knobbies to a road bike you will be between 15-20% faster at the same watts/effort. More like 9 mph faster. Which on a 20 mile commute = 46 minutes on the MTB, versus 33 minutes on a road bike, at the same level of effort. This is strictly a matter of gearing and mechanical advantage, for a roughly 30% increase in speed.
