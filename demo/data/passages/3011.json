The surface of the earth that is found on the continents is called the continental crust, which has a thickness of around 25 to 70 km. This crust is made up of igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, and that together make up the structure of our continents. \u2022 Continental crust is thicker (25-70 km) than oceanic crust (7-10 km) and is nearly 35-40km deep.

Both oceanic crust and continental crust are less dense than the mantle, but oceanic crust is denser than continental crust.

It has an approximate value of 2.6 g/cm3. Due to this difference in densities in magma between the oceanic crust and the continental crust, the continents stay in their places, and both crusts are able to float on the magma. The continental crust floats much more freely on the magma. The continental crust is much thicker when compared to the oceanic crust. The density of the oceanic crust is about 3.0 g/cm3. The continental crust has a lower density. This difference in the average densities allows many natural phenomenon to occur on and below the surface of the Earth.
