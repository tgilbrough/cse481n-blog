Hydrogen chloride HCl (g) is a gas, and when it dissolves in water it creates HCl (aq) which is what we know as hydrochloric acid. Something that is not dissolved in water cannot dissociate into water and therefore cannot be an acid. RE: Hydrochloric Acid-Compound or Mixture? If hydrogen chloride only forms hydrochloric acid upon contact with atmospheric humidity and hydrochloric acid is a solution of hydrogen chloride in water, a solution being a homogeneous mixture, what is hydrochloric acid then?"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid", "passage_text": "Hydrochloric acid is a clear, colorless, highly pungent solution of hydrogen chloride (H Cl) in water. It is a highly corrosive, strong mineral acid with many industrial uses. With major production starting in the Industrial Revolution, hydrochloric acid is used in the chemical industry as a chemical reagent in the large-scale production of vinyl chloride for PVC plastic, and MDI / TDI for polyurethane."}, {"url": "http://www.meritnation.com/ask-answer/question/is-hydrochloric-acid-a-mixture-or-compound-if-compound-the/motion/7921867", "passage_text": "More Answers. Technically, a mixture.Hydrogen chloride HCl (g) is a gas, and when it dissolves in water it creates HCl (aq) which is what we know as hydrochloric acid.Something that is not dissolved in water cannot dissociate into water and therefore cannot be an acid. Therefore hydrochloric acid comprises a compound (HCl) that has been dissolved into water, therefore its not a compound per se, but a mixture of a compound in water.

Since the chlorine atom is much more electronegative than the hydrogen atom, the covalent bond between the two atoms is quite polar. At room temperature, it is a colorless gas, which forms white fumes of hydrochloric acid upon contact with atmospheric humidity. Hydrogen chloride gas and hydrochloric acid are important in technology and industry."}, {"url": "https://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071225212142AAtqjUe", "passage_text": "(a) no compound is entirely ionic or entirely covalent, HCl has a ionic character too. (b)HCl is a gas at room temperature, and exists as separate molecules of HCl (hence covalent), but dissolves in water to produce Hydronium ions and chloride ions (hence ionic). (c) Have a look at Fajan's rules[1]. If a compound is ionic, it means that a metal is bonded w/ a non-metal to form a compound that will be solid at room-temp and is polar. Covalent is a bond between non-metals..not sure what coordinate is..metallic bonding would be between metals.."}, {"url": "https://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090404220347AAR2zRs", "passage_text": "Submit. \u00b7 just now. Report Abuse. HCl has a covalent bond. however, due to difference in electronegativity in H and Cl, HCl is actually a polar covalent bond. hence it posseses ionic character as well. this is due to the fact that Cl attracts the pair of electrons towards itself and hence aquires a delta-charge"}, {"url": "https://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071225212142AAtqjUe", "passage_text": "HCl is a covalent compound because the chlorine atoms share hydrogen atoms. covalent compounds are compounds which share electrons as the nucleus cannot bare the loss or gain of those electrons.
