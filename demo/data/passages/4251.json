Falling oil prices are affecting the drilling rig market in multiple ways. The cost of drilling rigs is expected to fall approximately 40 percent over the next year, Managing Director of Karoon Gas Australia Ltd. Robert Hosking told Bloomberg. A rig that cost upwards of $400,000 per day to rent may only cost $250,000 per day later this year. Why the fall? The decline in oil rig rental prices is a result of the oil and gas exploration market adjusting to lower oil prices and reduced spending on exploration and production projects.

It also signed a three year contract from a consortium of contractors at $460,000 a day in the Q3 of 2009. The exploration was based on oil stains found. But the well turned out to be a dry hole with no oil. Little wonder then that oil drilling is risky and expensive. According to Arizona Geological Survey, Oil drilling in Arizona costs between $400,000 to $1,000,000, depending on the depth of the hole and its location.

The reason it matters is because day rates and operating costs are vastly different. Day rates are typically $75,000 per day for jackups, and $400,000 or more a day for deepwater (rates vary widely, based on market conditions and rig availability)."}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-to-maintain-an-offshore-oil-rig-for-a-year", "passage_text": "Then there is the original cost of the ship, which can be anywhere from $600 to close to $1 billion.
