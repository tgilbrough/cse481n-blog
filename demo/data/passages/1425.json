The OxyContin / Vicodin test specifically tests for oxycodone in urine, so is much more reliable for that purpose than the opiates test, which detects morphine in urine."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Do_oxycodone_and_oxycontin_show_up_the_same_on_urine_test", "passage_text": "Yes, Oxycontin and morphine will show up the same because both are in the opiate class of medications. Actually they are different, Oxycontin is oxycodone. And on a standard \u2026 employment drug test oxycodone is not tested for. They do test for morphine, which heroin and codein break down to."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080519082152AAu8vKJ", "passage_text": "Opiates on a drug test such as codeine, morphine and heroin will show up as Opiates on a drug screen because they all metabolize in the body back into the opiate they test for. Oxycodone and hydrocodone are Opioids, and do not metabolize into the same metabolite that opiates do. Therefore it will not show up on your standard 5 panel drug screen. As far as Hydrocodone showing up as Oxycodone, I wouldn't risk it, these drugs are very closely related."}, {"url": "http://www.homehealthtesting.com/vicodin-test-oxycontin-test-oxycodone-drug-test-way-urin-p-76.html", "passage_text": "The opiates test is designed for drugs like codeine and morphine. Morphine and codeine are opiates. The compounds are found in the opium poppy. Oxycodone, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone are semi-synthetic opioids, meaning that they are made up from opiates but are not found in nature."}, {"url": "http://www.drugs.com/answers/does-oxycontin-and-oxycodone-show-up-the-same-on-453440.html", "passage_text": "Actually, sometimes Oxycontin (oxycodone) doesn't show up on a drug test. Most drug tests for opiates test for morphine (which most opiates are converted to in the body). Oxycontin (oxycodone) does not break down into morphine and can be missed on a drug test.
