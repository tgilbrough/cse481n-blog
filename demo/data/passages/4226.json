Kioko is still a puppy (8 months old), so her weight will be bigger as she matures, but she currently weighs 16 pounds and is 13 tall. I think she looks too skinny, but the vet says this is normal for her age and that she is perfect."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_much_does_beagles_weigh", "passage_text": "Usually a beagle should weigh from 20-25 pounds (10-12kg), but this can depend entirely on the build and fitness of the dog."}, {"url": "http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/beagle", "passage_text": "The American Kennel Club recognizes two varieties of Beagle.

Depending on the size of the dam and sire, a newborn Beagle puppy may weigh anywhere between 5 and 10 ounces. A healthy pup will gain weight each and every day. Those who have a litter are urged to weigh each pup, each day at the same time (morning, for example) and record the results."}, {"url": "http://www.ask.com/pets-animals/much-beagles-weigh-78762888b0ff49", "passage_text": "The AKC has two height categories for beagles: 13 inches and 15 inches.
