A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field.

Materials which retain their magnetism and are difficult to demagnetize are called hard magnetic materials. These materials retain their magnetism even after the removal of the applied magnetic field. Hence these materials are used for making permanent magnets. In permanent magnets the movement of the domain wall is prevented. They are prepared by heating the magnetic materials to the required temperature and then quenching them. Impurities increase the strength of hard magnetic materials. Soft magnetic materials are easy to magnetize and demagnetize. These materials are used for making temporary magnets. The domain wall movement is easy. Hence they are easy to magnetize. By annealing the cold worked material, the dislocation density is reduced and the domain wall movement is made easier"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet", "passage_text": "An electromagnet is made from a coil of wire that acts as a magnet when an electric current passes through it but stops being a magnet when the current stops. Often, the coil is wrapped around a core of soft ferromagnetic material such as steel, which greatly enhances the magnetic field produced by the coil. The overall strength of a magnet is measured by its magnetic moment or, alternatively, the total magnetic flux it produces. Materials that can be magnetized, which are also the ones that are strongly attracted to a magnet, are called ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic). These include iron, nickel, cobalt, some alloys of rare earth metals, and some naturally occurring minerals such as lodestone."}]
