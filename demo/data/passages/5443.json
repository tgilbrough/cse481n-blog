CIDR is the short for Classless Inter-Domain Routing, an IP addressing scheme that replaces the older system based on classes A, B, and C. A single IP address can be used to designate many unique IP addresses with CIDR."}, {"url": "http://whatismyipaddress.com/cidr", "passage_text": "CIDR IP addresses consist of two groups of numbers, which are also referred to as groups of bits. The most important of these groups is the network address, and it is used to identify a network or a sub-network (subnet). The lesser of the bit groups is the host identifier."}, {"url": "http://whatismyipaddress.com/cidr", "passage_text": "In CIDR notation, IP addresses are written as a prefix, and a suffix is attached to indicate how many bits are in the entire address. The suffix is set apart from the prefix with a slash mark. For instance, in the CIDR notation 192.0.1.0/24, the prefix is 192.0.1.0, and the total number of bits in the address is 24."}, {"url": "http://mxtoolbox.com/SubnetCalculator.aspx", "passage_text": "ABOUT SUBNET CALCULATOR. The subnet calculator lets you enter a subnet range (CIDR) and see IP address information about that range.
