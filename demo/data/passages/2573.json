The nephron is the basic unit of the kidney. It's a long, thin tube that is closed at one end, has two twisted regions interspaced with a long hairpin loop, ends in a long straight portion and is surrounded by capillaries. Each part of the nephron has different types of cells with different properties -- this is important in understanding how the kidney regulates the composition of the blood. The nephron has a unique blood supply compared to other organs: 1  Afferent arteriole-connects the renal artery with the glomerular"}, {"url": "http://schools-wikipedia.org/wp/n/Nephron.htm", "passage_text": "Each nephron is composed of an initial filtering component (the  renal corpuscle) and a tubule specialized for reabsorption and secretion (the renal tubule). The renal corpuscle filters out large solutes from the blood, delivering water and small solutes to the renal tubule for modification. Composed of a glomerulus and Bowman's capsule, the renal corpuscle (or Malpighian corpuscle) is the beginning of the nephron.
