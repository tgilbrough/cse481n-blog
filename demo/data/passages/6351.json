He was the first to use the word cell, because the first cells he observed looked similar to monk\u2019s cells. He observed cork cells and published his findings in a book called Micrographia in 1665. He discovered many different types of cells including bacteria, sperm, muscle fibers and protozoa. He was also made the first description of a red blood cell.
