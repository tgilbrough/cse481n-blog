Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates are organic compounds made of  carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbs are made of  monosacharrides (single sugars) linked together. Thei \u2026 r function is  to provide a key source of energy for cells. An example is starch,  made of many linked glucose molecules."}, {"url": "http://www.scienceprofonline.com/chemistry/what-is-organic-chemistry-carbohydrates-proteins-lipids-nucleic-acids.html", "passage_text": "The feature that distinguishes an organic from inorganic molecule is that organic molecules contain carbon-hydrogen bonds, whereas inorganic molecules do not.
