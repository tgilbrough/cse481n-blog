There is no giant ring around the moon, but if there was one it would simply be called a 'ring'. A ring is made up of tiny shards of dust and rocks orbiting around a body. who ever typed the above is a dork because i just saw the ring around the moon and came in to look it up! Its called a Halo"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22%C2%B0_halo", "passage_text": "A 22 degree halo around the moon in Atherton, CA. A 22\u00b0 halo is a halo, one type of optical phenomenon, forming a circle with a radius of approximately 22\u00b0 around the Sun, or occasionally the Moon (also called a moon ring or winter halo). It forms as sunlight is refracted in millions of randomly oriented hexagonal ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Another phenomenon resulting in a ring around the Sun/Moon\u2014and therefore sometimes confused with the 22\u00b0 halo\u2014is the corona. Unlike the 22\u00b0 halo, however, it is produced by water droplets instead of ice crystals and it is much smaller and more colorful."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110119223444AAchM7K", "passage_text": "Relevance. Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Haloes are caused by refraction through ice crystals in cirrostratus cloud. The most common is the 22\u00b0 halo which is a ring around the sun or the moon. Sundogs or moondogs are bright spots which appear sometimes on the 22\u00b0 halo either side of the sun or moon. There are many different halo phenomena caused by ice crystals with different shapes but most of them are only seen in polar regions"}, {"url": "http://home.hiwaay.net/~krcool/Astro/moon/moonring/", "passage_text": "A Ring Around The Moon. The ring around the Moon is caused by the refraction of Moonlight (which of course is reflected sunlight) from ice crystals in the upper atmosphere.
