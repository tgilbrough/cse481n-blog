When I get the daily sales newsletters and see what\u2019s being offered for $1-3, my first step is to check Scribd. I\u2019m always curious, for example, about a $3 cookbook. For $3, even if there\u2019s only one recipe that I will reuse regularly, it\u2019s worth the price. But if that cookbook is already in the Scribd library, I\u2019ve already paid for it. If I\u2019m paying $9 per month, it\u2019s well worth it for me to add discounted cookbooks to my digital library and not buy them at $1-3 each. In the long run, with my easily-tempted book buying habits, this is saving me a bit of money. So for $9, you can get a library of Scribd audiobooks, which is a bit cheaper than the least expensive Audible plan, which start at more than $10 for most users."}, {"url": "http://www.cnet.com/how-to/amazon-kindle-unlimited-vs-scribd-vs-oyster-e-book-subscriptions/", "passage_text": "The app's design is enticing, and the book selection is varied and easy to browse. Last on my list, Scribd is very similar to Oyster, but with a few unique features.

E-book subscription services are all the rage this year, thanks in part to Amazon.
