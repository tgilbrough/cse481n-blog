[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis", "passage_text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long lasting autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly the wrist and hands are involved with typically the same joints involved on both sides of the body. While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule."}, {"url": "http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=60768", "passage_text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease that causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints. It occurs when the immune system, which normally defends the body from invading organisms, turns its attack against the membrane lining the joints.

With rheumatoid arthritis, there is typically involvement of the wrist joints as well as the finger joints closest to the hand.
