In the pages that follow, we shall take a look at what each source of non-renewable energy is made of, and how they are used. Note that not all non-renewable energy comes from fossil fuels. There is also uranium, which is not a fossil fuel. Energy exists freely in nature. Some of them exist infinitely (never run out, called RENEWABLE), the rest have finite amounts (they took millions of years to form, and will run out one day, called NON-RENEWABLE). Non-renewable energy is energy from fossil fuels (coal, crude oil, natural gas) and uranium. Fossil fuels are mainly made up of Carbon. It is believed that fossil fuels were formed over 300 million years ago, when the earth was a lot different in its landscape. It had swampy forests and very shallow seas"}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Where_are_the_fossil_fuels_located_in_the_US", "passage_text": "Confidence votes 713. The most common fossil fuel we refer to is oil which is found in Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska in the largest amounts although various other states also have shown significant deposits.

There are three major forms of fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas.

"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "passage_text": "Fossil fuels are fuels formed by natural processes such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms. The age of the organisms and their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years, and sometimes exceeds 650 million years. Fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include coal, petroleum and natural gas. Other more commonly used derivatives of fossil fuels include kerosene and propane. Natural gas deposits are also the main source of the element helium. Heavy crude oil, which is much more viscous than conventional crude oil, and tar sands, where bitumen is found mixed with sand and clay, are becoming more important as sources of fossil fuel."}, {"url": "http://geography.about.com/od/economic-geography/a/Fossil-Fuels.htm", "passage_text": "By Ping Zhou. Fossil fuels are non-renewable resources created by the anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms. They include petroleum, natural gas, and coal. Fossil fuels serve as the dominant source of energy for humanity, powering over four-fifths of the world's utilities. "}]
