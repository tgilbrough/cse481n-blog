Ferritin levels can be used to indirectly measure the iron levels in the body. Ferritin has the shape of a hollow sphere that permits the entry of a variable amount of iron for storage (as ferric hydroxide phosphate complexes). 1 High levels of ferritin can indicate an iron storage disorder, such as hemochromatosis, or a chronic disease process. 2  Low levels of ferritin are indicative of iron deficiency, which causes anemia (a reduction in the number of red blood cells)."}, {"url": "http://www.medicinenet.com/ferritin_blood_test/article.htm", "passage_text": "1 The ferritin test is a simple blood test. 2  High levels of ferritin can indicate an iron storage disorder, such as hemochromatosis, or a chronic disease process. 3  Low levels of ferritin are indicative of iron deficiency, which causes anemia (a reduction in the number of red blood cells). 1 High levels of ferritin can indicate an iron storage disorder, such as hemochromatosis, or a chronic disease process. 2"}, {"url": "http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ferritin-test/basics/definition/PRC-20014449", "passage_text": "Definition. A ferritin test measures the amount of ferritin in your blood. Ferritin is a blood cell protein that contains iron. A ferritin test helps your doctor understand how much iron your body is storing. If a ferritin test reveals that your blood ferritin level is lower than normal, it indicates your body's iron stores are low and you have iron deficiency. If a ferritin test shows higher than normal levels, it could indicate that you have a condition that causes your body to store too much iron."}, {"url": "http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=167&ContentID=ferritin_blood", "passage_text": "Ferritin is a protein that stores iron.
