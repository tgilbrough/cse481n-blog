Our sense of taste can identify four basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty and bitter. The first taste that we encounter (breast milk) is sweet, which may be why a sweet taste is appreciated and interpreted positively. For example, a small amount of added sugar can enhance the taste of nutritious, but sour or bitter foods. Sugar\u2019s aroma enhancing properties are used in a wide range of foods, such as bread and fruit products."}, {"url": "http://www.comitesucre.org/site/about-sugar/sugars-role-in-food-and-nutrition/", "passage_text": "Sugar is first and foremost used because of its sweetening properties. It has a clean sweet taste with no aftertaste and is the reference against which other sweeteners are compared. Beyond its sweetening properties, sugar provides structure and texture to many traditional foods, such as bakery products and jam. As in addition to its sweet taste, sugar contributes to the colour, flavour and texture of food, adding sugar to foods can improve their taste and palatability, thereby increasing the range of foods that people can eat."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose", "passage_text": "Fructose, or fruit sugar, is a simple ketonic monosaccharide found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. When fructose is consumed in the form of sucrose, it is digested (broken down) and then absorbed as free fructose. As sucrose comes into contact with the membrane of the small intestine, the enzyme sucrase catalyzes the cleavage of sucrose to yield one glucose unit and one fructose unit, which are then each absorbed."}, {"url": "http://www.dansukker.co.uk/uk/about-sugar/functional-properties-of-sugar.aspx", "passage_text": "Sugar now comes in many varieties and can be used in many food products.

It is common for individuals to associate sugar (sucrose) with its inherent taste properties. Aside from providing a sweet taste and flavour, sugar imparts numerous functional properties that make it an important ingredient in many foods. Specific functional properties of sugar can be classified into four broad categories: sensory, physical, microbial and chemical. Solubility-Sugar is very soluble in water.
