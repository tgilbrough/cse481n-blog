A cardiac perfusion scan is done to: 1  Find the cause of unexplained chest pain or pressure. 2  Find the cause of chest pain or pressure brought on by exercise. 3  Check for the location and amount of damage caused by a heart attack. 4  Identify coronary artery disease (CAD) ."}, {"url": "http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/cardiovascular/myocardial_perfusion_scan_stress_92,P07979/", "passage_text": "Myocardial perfusion scan with exercise. A myocardial perfusion scan with exercise is used to determine what areas of the heart muscle (myocardium) demonstrate decreased blood flow during exercise. This is done by injecting a radionuclide (thallium or technetium) into a vein in the arm or hand during exercise. There are two types of stress myocardial perfusion scans, one that is used in conjunction with exercise (myocardial perfusion scan with exercise) and one that is used in conjunction with medication (pharmacologic myocardial perfusion scan)."}, {"url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDesZ4Grb_E", "passage_text": "Cynthia Cervantes, Director of the Barry University Cardiovascular Perfusion program, explains CVP and what it takes to be a perfusionist.
