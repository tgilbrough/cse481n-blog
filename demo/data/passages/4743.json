There are several differences between transcript and genomic DNA, first, cDNA doesn't contain introns. cDNAs are much shorter, as introns can span thousands of pase pairs, and therefore easily cloned and worked with."}, {"url": "http://www.majordifferences.com/2013/11/difference-between-genomic-and-cdna.html", "passage_text": "The resulting double stranded DNA fragments are then inserted into a suitable vector and cloned, creating a population of clones called cDNA library. Since, a cDNA library is derived from mRNA, the library contains the coding region of expressed genes only, with no introns or regulatory regions. Such a library lacks the non coding DNA that makes up a large portion of many eukaryotic genomes. Vectors used genomic library include plasmid, cosmid, lambda phage, BAC and YAC in order to accommodate large fragments.

The \u201cc\u201d in cDNA stands for copy because a double stranded DNA copy is made from a mRNA. Because of the different starting material, cDNA libraries will have some key distinctions from a genomic library. The reasons for the differences above are because of the nature of gene expression."}, {"url": "http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/recombinant-dna/cdna-libraries-and-expression-libraries/", "passage_text": "Session Overview.

Even though, they are structurally similar, their function and the way of synthesis differs from each other. DNA. DNA is a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in all eukaryotes and some prokaryotes. DNA is synthesized naturally while cDNA is a form of DNA which is synthesized by the scientist for their experimental purpose. Genomic DNA contains both introns and exons but cDNA is made up of only exons, which codes for specific functions. cDNAs are much shorter, as introns can span thousands of base pair"}, {"url": "http://funnelbrain.com/c-778948-three-key-differences-between-genomic-cdna-library.html", "passage_text": "A genomic library contains all the DNA sequences found in a genome.
