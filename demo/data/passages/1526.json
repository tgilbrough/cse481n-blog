A pity, perhaps; my Uncle George used it with excellent results in the 1930s, and 40s. I use soft rock phosphate if and when I need phosphorus. I try to use organic products only. I have been using bone meal in my vegetable garden, usually before planting. I have been looking for an alterative, and noticed in some of the past threads that superphosphate is recommended."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-superphosphate-fertilizer.htm", "passage_text": "Superphosphate fertilizers have a high content of the nutrient phosphate. One of the three nutrients essential to healthy plant growth, phosphate can be applied in a high concentration with a superphosphate fertilizer to plants ranging from houseplants to agricultural crops. Several different types of this fertilizer have been created for different needs. All three types of superphosphate are usually made with a naturally occurring substance called rock phosphate. While this can be applied as a fertilizer in its raw form, putting it through the chemical reactions to create other types of fertilizer has been found to make it more effective."}, {"url": "http://www.ipni.net/publication/nss.nsf/beagle?OpenAgent&d=NSS-14&f=NSS-14%20Triple%20Superphosphate.pdf", "passage_text": "Triple Superphosphate Triple superphosphate (TSP) was one of the first high analysis P fertilizers that became widely used in the 20th cen-tury.

Several million tons are produced annually for use as fertilizers. Residual HF typically reacts with silicate minerals co-mingled with the phophate ores to produce hydrofluorosilicic acid (H 2 SiF 6). Monocalcium phosphate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2 (ACMP or CMP-A for anhydrous monocalcium phosphate). It is commonly found as the monohydrate (MCP or MCP-M), Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2 \u00b7H 2 O (CAS# 10031-30-8).

Regardless of type of plant, all require a healthy amount of phosphorus in order to survive. This nutrient is present in every cell of the plant, and is vital in maintaining the strength of the cell structure.
