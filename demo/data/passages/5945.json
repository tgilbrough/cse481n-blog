The relationship between cnidarians and dinoflagellate algae is termed as symbiotic, because both the animal host and the algae are benefiting from the association. It is a mutualistic interaction. For some cnidarian species, it has been studied whether or not they could even survive without the dinoflagellate algae. Before discussing the different advantages between the symbiosis of cnidarians and dinoflagellate algae, a brief overview of dinoflagellate characteristics must first be presented. Dinoflagellate algae make up the division Pyrrophyta."}]
