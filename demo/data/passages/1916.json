Running a real .org that really sends on the petitions and really does everything they claim is a perfect cover for dishonest activity. Low cost, volunteer labour and a cheap web presence. Thanks for this information. I like the reply that Avaaz should organise a petition against spam !!!! I\u2019m sorry guys, but it seems to me that avazz do such good work that your complaining about not getting a personal email & accusing them of being spamers themselves is a bit sad."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avaaz", "passage_text": "Avaaz is a global civic organization launched in January 2007 that promotes activism on issues such as climate change, human rights, animal rights, corruption, poverty, and conflict; it works to close the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want..

An online petition (or Internet petition, or e-petition) is a form of petition which is signed online, usually through a form on a website. Visitors to the online petition sign the petition by adding their details such as name and email address. Typically, after there are enough signatories, the resulting letter may be delivered to the subject of the petition, usually via e-mail. The online petition may also deliver an email to the target of the petition each time the petition is signed."}, {"url": "http://www.safepetitions.com/legitimate-petition-sites-list/", "passage_text": "Legitimate Petition Sites List.
