Those 1st rounds use to be 6 hours or so. Honestly, I didn't mind because the draft only was 2 days (at the time) of the entire year. Now it's 3 but I like it being slightly quicker especially waiting for your team to pick. As long as possible, I love the draft, I love the excitement when trades are announced, and with the uncertainty of the Number 1 Overall Pick this year noone has any idea whats going on. I love Mike Mayock and the experts explaining the pick and why they are good/bad etc."}, {"url": "http://www.fantasysharks.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=263772", "passage_text": "Post subject: Re: How long does a live auction draft usually take.

That is an average of $2.06 million a year. Most all first round draft picks sign a 5 or 6 year contract. Since all 32 draft choices are not signed it is not possible to come up with an average but it would be safe to say an average of $5 to $6 million a year would be in the ballpark.
