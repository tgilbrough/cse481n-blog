That\u2019s because the chemical process used to make this polymer completely changes the structure of Formaldehyde so that it is present in very minimal concentrations (usually 0.2%) or even not at all. The resin are ingredients that add depth, gloss and hardness to the film of a nail polish. An example of a polymer used as a resin in nail polish is tosylamide-formaldehyde resin (a soft resin made with Toluenesulfonamide and Formaldehyde.)."}, {"url": "http://loodieloodieloodie.blogspot.com/2011/07/formaldehyde-vs-formaldhehyde-resin.html", "passage_text": "This series may be of use.

It is used in some nail hardeners but not in the actual polish. A resin, tosylamide/formaldehyde resin, makes the polish tough and resilient. While the resin is manufactured from formaldehyde, once the product becomes a resin, the formaldehyde is chemically changed and essentially no longer present. For example, OPI states they do not use formaldehyde in their polishes, with the exception of 2-3 nail hardeners (which they named). But upon looking at the ingredients of even some of their newer polishes (colors from the 2009 holiday collection or the Spain collection, for example) an..."}, {"url": "http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/tosylamideformaldehyde-resin-0", "passage_text": "More scientific Information: Tosylamide/formaldehyde Resin, also referred to as Toluenesulfonamide/Formaldehyde Resin, is a reaction product of toluenesulfonamide and formaldehyde.
