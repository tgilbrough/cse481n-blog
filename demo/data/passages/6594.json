Coconuts, like most nuts, contain significant amounts of fat, but unlike other nuts, which contain mostly monounsaturated fat, the fat provided by coconuts is almost all in the form of health-promoting medium chain triglycerides (MCTs). Researchers concluded that long-term substitution of medium chain triglycerides for long chain triglycerides [MCT for LCT] would produce weight loss if energy intake remained constant.. So if you simply substitute coconut oil for sources of LCTs in your diet, you are going to lose weight."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-chain_triglyceride", "passage_text": "Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are triglycerides whose fatty acids have an aliphatic tail of 6\u201312 carbon atoms. The fatty acids found in MCTs are called medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). Like all triglycerides, MCTs are composed of a glycerol backbone and three fatty acids. In the case of MCTs, 2 or 3 of the fatty acid chains attached to glycerol are medium-chain in length. Rich sources for commercial extraction of beneficial MCTs include palm kernel oil and coconut oil."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/316430-sources-of-medium-chain-triglycerides/", "passage_text": "Overview.

Medium-chain fats are in the middle, with 6 to 12. There are three separate fatty acids classified as medium-chain triglycerides: 1  Caproic acid (also called hexanoic acid or C6:0). 2  Caprylic acid (also called octanoic acid or C8:0)."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/316430-sources-of-medium-chain-triglycerides/", "passage_text": "Coconut Oil.
