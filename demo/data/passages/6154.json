DMSO was used also as a pharmaceutical since 1961, when Dr. Jacob investigated its potential as a preservative. Soon, he discovered that this colourless liquid penetrated the skin very fast, but without damaging it. DMSO is a substance also known as RIMSO. Its actual name is Dimethyl Sulfoxide and is an industrial solvent. The sulfuric compound has been recognized as highly beneficial in therapies since the 1960s, but its use is very controversial.

The sodium derivative of DMSO formed in this way is referred to as  dimsyl sodium . It is a base, e.g., for the deprotonation of ketones to form sodium enolates, phosphonium salts to form Wittig reagents, and formamidinium salts to form diaminocarbenes.

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a by-product of the wood industry, has been in use as a commercial solvent since 1953. It is also one of the most studied but least understood pharmaceutical agents of our time--at least in the United States. Others cite DMSO's principal side effect: an odd odor, akin to that of garlic, that emanates from the mouth shortly after use, even if use is through the skin. Certainly, this odor has made double-blinded studies difficult."}]
