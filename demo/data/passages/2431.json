The laser contains a chamber in which atoms of a medium such as a synthetic ruby rod or a gas are excited to a high energy level. A device that emits a very narrow and intense beam of light or other radiation. The light is generated by exciting the atoms of a medium, such as a crystal, gas, or liquid.

A laser consists of a gain medium, a mechanism to energize it, and something to provide optical feedback. The gain medium is a material with properties that allow it to amplify light by way of stimulated emission. Light of a specific wavelength that passes through the gain medium is amplified (increases in power)."}, {"url": "http://www.spaceplace.nasa.gov/laser/en/", "passage_text": "No, not in light sabers! For one thing, lasers can be used in a device called a spectrometer. A spectrometer uses light to identify the chemical composition of matter. For example, as light passes through a gas, the gas soaks up certain colors, or wavelengths, of light. Different gases absorb different wavelengths. First, the light from a laser contains exactly one color or wavelength rather than a lot of different wavelengths. Scientists say that laser light is  monochromatic , meaning of one color. Flash is required to view this animation. Second, all the wavelengths are in phase."}, {"url": "http://www.spaceplace.nasa.gov/laser/en/", "passage_text": "Doctors use lasers to do delicate surgery, such as eye surgery.
