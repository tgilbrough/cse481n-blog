Obviously, crossing over is only part of meiosis, hence the term chiasma only being used in that context. At the chiasma, the chromatids can exchange genetic information, resulting in new combinations of genetic material. When the chromatids separate and become sister chromosomes, they will contain a different mix of genetic material than their parent chromosomes."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiastic_structure", "passage_text": "The term chiastic derives from the mid-17th century term chiasmus, which refers to a crosswise arrangement of concepts or words that are repeated in reverse order. Chiasmus derives from the Greek word khiasmos, a word that is khiazein, marked with the letter khi. From khi comes chi.

A process occurring during meiosis wherein two chromosomes pair up and exchange segments of their genetic material. Supplement. This occurs at the stage when chromatids of homologous chromosomes pair up during synapsis, forming X-structure (chiasma). Crossing over is important because it results in new combinations of genes that are different from either parent, contributing to genetic diversity.
