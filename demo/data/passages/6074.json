If it\u2019s half a page or less, you should just be damn sure that it\u2019s truly passing that litmus test. It\u2019s hard to meet that test if you\u2019re writing very short. Not impossible, but a lot harder."}, {"url": "http://www.askamanager.org/2014/10/how-long-should-a-cover-letter-be.html", "passage_text": "The perfect length for a cover letter is the amount of space that it takes to explain why you\u2019re an unusually strong candidate for the job aside from what\u2019s on your resume. Half a page isn\u2019t usually going to be enough to truly do that \u2014 although there are exceptions to that."}, {"url": "http://jobsearch.about.com/od/cover-letter/fl/How-Long-Should-a-Cover-Letter-Be.htm", "passage_text": "Your cover letter shouldn't be longer than one page. It should highlight your most relevant qualifications for the job and what you have to offer the employer. In fact, as far as how long your cover letter should be, shorter is better. Almost 70% of employers wanted a cover letter of less than a full page and about 25% said the shorter the better.

The cover letter serves as the first Hello from potential employee to employer.

This space is quite limited hence the importance of one being specific. Write concisely focusing on the company\u2019s present lack and the skills and experience that you have to fill the void."}]
