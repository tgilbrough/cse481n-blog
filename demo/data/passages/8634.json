Iatrogenic mandibular fracture associated with the removal of teeth, which can occur during the procedure or at a later time, is rare; reported incidences range from 0.0034% to 0.0075% (6, 7)."}, {"url": "http://www.medsci.org/v08p0547.htm", "passage_text": "The extraction of impacted mandibular third molars is a common dental procedure. The reasons for extracting these teeth include acute or chronic pericoronitis, the presence of cysts or a tumor, periodontal problems, the pres\u00adence of a carious lesion, and preparation for orthodontic treatment or orthognathic surgery (1)."}, {"url": "http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/82774-overview", "passage_text": "Equipment.
