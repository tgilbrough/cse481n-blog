There are two types of polymers: synthetic and natural. Synthetic polymers are derived from petroleum oil, and made by scientists and engineers. Examples of synthetic polymers include nylon, polyethylene, polyester, Teflon, and epoxy. Natural polymers occur in nature and can be extracted.

Addition polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), and polystyrene are linear or branched polymers with little or no cross-linking. As a result, they are thermoplastic materials, which flow easily when heated and can be molded into a variety of shapes. Polyethylene has no taste or odor and is lightweight, nontoxic, and relatively inexpensive. It is used as a film for packaging food, clothing, and hardware. Most commercial trash bags, sandwich bags, and plastic wrapping are made from polyethylene films."}, {"url": "http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/Courses/ce435/Polyethylene/ce435_intro.html", "passage_text": "New Polyethylene polymers are still being developed today.

A polymer is a molecule that consists of certain type of arrangement of atoms that is repeated over and over. The result is a very large molecule that can consist of 2000 or more of the base compound.

Polymers that contain only a single type of repeat unit are known as homopolymers, while polymers containing a mixture of repeat units are known as copolymers. Poly(styrene), for example, is composed only of styrene monomer residues, and is therefore classified as a homopolymer. A branched polymer molecule is composed of a main chain with one or more substituent side chains or branches. Types of branched polymers include star polymers, comb polymers, brush polymers, dendronized polymers, ladders, and dendrimers."}]
