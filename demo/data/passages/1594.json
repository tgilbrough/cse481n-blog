Biofuels have been around as long as cars have. At the start of the 20th century, Henry Ford planned to fuel his Model Ts with ethanol, and early diesel engines were shown to run on peanut oil. But discoveries of huge petroleum deposits kept gasoline and diesel cheap for decades, and biofuels were largely forgotten. For decades, Brazil has turned sugarcane into ethanol, and some cars there can run on pure ethanol rather than as additive to fossil fuels. And biodiesel\u2014a diesel-like fuel commonly made from palm oil\u2014is generally available in Europe. On the face of it, biofuels look like a great solution."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel", "passage_text": "Biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles.

By biofuels on this page, I mean fuels for vehicles, such as biodiesel and bioethanol - although you can also use the term biofuel to cover any kind of fuel made from living materials or their waste.
