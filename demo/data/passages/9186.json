I don't know if you are also asking if you can ice the cake while frozen. I also do this but not if the cake is frozen extremely hard, like a rock hard. If you ice it when the cake is frozen too hard then when the cake thaws it will move and in so doing crack the icing. I like to pull my cakes out for about 30 minutes before I fill, ice and decorate.

I want to make a cake early, so the day that I need to decorate it, it won't take me as long, but I've never frozen a cake before. This time it will be a 6 and 9 round cake. Can anyone give me any ideas/pointers as to what is the best way to do this, so my cakes are still moist when it's time to eat it. Thanks! Hope this helps. I take the cakes out two days ahead.

A cake will generally freeze well for a few months, but not more than that. Whilst freezing initially retains the moisture of a pre-baked cake, cakes will tend to dry out after two months of freezing and you can expect the flavor to change at around four months."}, {"url": "http://www.wikihow.com/Freeze-Cakes", "passage_text": "Let your cake cool. Before you can freeze your cake for later consumption, you must let it cool. So if you've just baked a cake, put it aside for about three hours.
