A change in or the process of changing, e.g. nature, form or quality. (genetics). (1) A permanent, heritable change in the nucleotide sequence in a gene or a chromosome; the process in which such a change occurs in a gene or in a chromosome."}, {"url": "http://www.definitions.net/definition/Mutation", "passage_text": "(biology) an organism that has characteristics resulting from chromosomal alteration. mutation, genetic mutation, chromosomal mutation (noun). (genetics) any event that changes genetic structure; any alteration in the inherited nucleic acid sequence of the genotype of an organism."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "passage_text": "In biology, a mutation is a permanent change of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of an organism, virus, or extrachromosomal DNA or other genetic elements. Mutations result from damage to DNA which is not repaired, errors in the process of replication, or from the insertion or deletion of segments of DNA by mobile genetic elements. Mutations may or may not produce discernible changes in the observable characteristics (phenotype) of an organism."}, {"url": "http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation", "passage_text": "A gene mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene, such that the sequence differs from what is found in most people. Mutations range in size; they can affect anywhere from a single DNA building block (base pair) to a large segment of a chromosome that includes multiple genes. "}, {"url": "http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Genetics/Pages/Facts.aspx", "passage_text": "This may result in a genetic disorder or a change in characteristics. Mutations can be caused by exposure to specific chemicals or radiation. For example, cigarette smoke is full of chemicals that attack and damage DNA. This causes mutations in lung cell genes, including the ones that control growth."}, {"url": "http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/ahp/BioInfo/MUT/Mut.Definition.html", "passage_text": "Definition. A Mutation occurs when a DNA gene is damaged or changed in such a way as to alter the genetic message carried by that gene. A Mutagen is an agent of substance that can bring about a permanent alteration to the physical composition of a DNA gene such that the genetic message is changed. "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "passage_text": "Mutation can result in several different types of change in sequences. Mutations in genes can either have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning properly or completely.utations result from damage to DNA which is not repaired, errors in the process of replication, or from the insertion or deletion of segments of DNA by mobile genetic elements. Mutations may or may not produce discernible changes in the observable characteristics (phenotype) of an organism."}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/higher/biology/genetics_adaptation/mutations/revision/1/", "passage_text": "The word mutation means a change in the genetic composition of a cell. Mutations can be divided into two main groups. The first group is gene mutations. These are chemical changes in the DNA [DNA: The material inside the nucleus of cells, carrying genetic information.DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.] of the cell."}, {"url": "http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/Genetic-Mutation-1127", "passage_text": "Although various types of molecular changes exist, the word  mutation  typically refers to a change that affects the nucleic acids. In cellular organisms, these nucleic acids are the building blocks of DNA, and in viruses they are the building blocks of either DNA or RNA.utations are changes in the genetic sequence, and they are a main cause of diversity among organisms. These changes occur at many different levels, and they can have widely differing consequences."}, {"url": "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/genetic+mutation", "passage_text": "genetic mutation - (genetics) any event that changes genetic structure; any alteration in the inherited nucleic acid sequence of the genotype of an organism."}]
