The United States Geological Survey adapted Fenneman's scheme in their Physiographic division of the United States. The section is somewhat larger than the hydrographic definition. The Great Basin's two most populous metropolitan areas are the Reno-Sparks metropolitan area to the west and Wasatch Front to the east.
