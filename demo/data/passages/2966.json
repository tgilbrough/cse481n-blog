Therefore, it does not make sense to classify it as a morphine-equivalent analgesic. The authors assert that fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, oxycodone, and oxymorphone are stronger than morphine. While it is true that a smaller dose of these drugs may be required to obtain the same analgesic response as can be obtained with morphine, that fact does not mean that they have greater effectiveness. Tramadol has a different mechanism of action than does morphine; there is a ceiling to the pain relief that tramadol can provide. It makes no sense to put it in the same category as the other drugs.
