To calculate the weight of material needed for a project you will need to know the compacted density of the material. Density is the weight of material per volume. For example pounds per cubic foot. The density of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) does vary depending on mix proportions and type of aggregate. Now that you have the area calculated, you next need to calculate the quantities.

A cubic yard is equal to 27 cubic feet. Multiply 27 by 145, which is the weight of asphalt in pounds per cubic foot given by the NAPA. Twenty-seven multiplied by 145 equals 3,915, so asphalt weighs 3,915 pounds per cubic yard. Multiply that number by the amount of entire cubic yards to calculate the total weight. For example, if the volume encompasses 50 cubic yards, the total weight of the asphalt is 195,750 pounds"}, {"url": "http://homeguides.sfgate.com/calculate-asphalt-weight-per-yard-81825.html", "passage_text": "NAPA estimates an average asphalt density of 145 pounds per cubic foot, or 3,915 pounds per cubic yard. For example, if your calculated volume is 25 cubic yards, multiplying 25 by 3,915 will give you an asphalt weight per cubic yard of 97,875 pounds, or about 49 tons. 1  Tape measure. 3. Convert cubic feet to cubic yards. Because there are 27 cubic feet per cubic yard, you will divide your total cubic feet by 27.
