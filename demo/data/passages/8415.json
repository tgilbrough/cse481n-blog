Naturally colored cotton is cotton that has been bred to have colors other than the yellowish off-white typical of modern commercial cotton fibres. Colors grown include red, green and several shades of brown. The cotton's natural color does not fade. Yields are typically lower and the fiber is shorter and weaker but has a softer feel than the more commonly available white cotton. Due to the non-industrialized product naturally colored cottons yield less per acre, but growers are paid higher prices for their harvest. In 1993, colored cotton prices ranged from $3.60 to $4.50 per pound compared to conventional white cotton at $0.60 to $0.90 per pound."}, {"url": "http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=3341", "passage_text": "Linen is also a natural product made from fibers from the flax plant. Linen, like cotton, is made from cellulose, which is a polymer of glucose molecules. Nylon is a synthetic polymer made from a condensation reaction between two chemicals. It is essentially like a long, thin fiber of plastic. Linen is made from a plant (cotton), silk is made by (not from!) an animal (the silk worm spins silk to make cocoons, very similar to the ones you sometimes see caterpillars make), and nylon is made by people in factories! Although all three of these materials come from different sources, they are very similar."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Where_does_cotton_come_from", "passage_text": "Cotton grows from seeds of the cotton tree/plant/shrub-gossypium.
