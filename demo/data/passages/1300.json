It is often positive for catalase and nitrate reduction. Although S. aureus is not always pathogenic, it is a common cause of skin infections such as abscesses, respiratory infections such as sinusitis, and food poisoning. Pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing potent protein toxins, and expressing cell-surface proteins that bind and inactivate antibodies."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-mrsa", "passage_text": "In this article. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterium that causes infections in different parts of the body. It's tougher to treat than most strains of staphylococcus aureus -- or staph -- because it's resistant to some commonly used antibiotics. The symptoms of MRSA depend on where you're infected. Most often, it causes mild infections on the skin, like sores or boils."}, {"url": "http://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-Staphylococcus-Aureus.aspx", "passage_text": "Staphylococcus aureus is a type of bacteria. It stains Gram positive and is non-moving small round shaped or non-motile cocci. It is found in grape-like (staphylo-) clusters. This is why it is called Staphylococcus.

It can also cause abscesses and spread into the bones (osteomyelitis), lungs (staphylococcal pneumonia), blood (bacteremia or sepsis), heart (endocarditis), and other organs. Staph infections that are acquired while a person is in a hospital, long-term care facility, or other health care setting have been a challenge for many years. The confined population and the widespread use of antibiotics have led to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus."}, {"url": "http://www.medicinenet.com/staph_infection_pictures_slideshow/article.htm", "passage_text": "Commonly referred to as Staph (pronounced staff), it is common bacteria found on most people's skin, and often it does not cause disease. More than 30 types of Staphylococci bacteria cause infections, but the most common type of Staph infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus. If the bacteria gains access to the body, either through a wound on the skin or via the respiratory tract, it can cause serious infections. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is a type of staph resistant to antibiotics, including methicillin, penicillin, amoxicillin, and oxacillin."}, {"url": "http://www.safecarecampaign.org/mrsa.html", "passage_text": "Methicilllin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (pronounced MUHR-sa) infection is caused by staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Decades ago, a strain of staph emerged in hospitals that was resistant to the broad-spectrum antibiotics commonly used to treat it. Dubbed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), it was one of the first germs to outwit all but the most powerful drugs. Staph bacteria are normally found on the skin or in the nose of about one-third of the population."}, {"url": "http://patient.info/health/mrsa-leaflet", "passage_text": "Many people are carriers of MRSA without even realising it, as MRSA often does not cause symptoms in healthy people. Staphylococcus aureus is a germ (bacterium). It is often just called ' S. aureus ' or 'staph'. S. aureus bacteria are often found on the skin and in the nose of healthy people. These people are called S. aureus carriers. In healthy people who are carriers, S. aureus is usually harmless."}, {"url": "http://www.cdc.gov/mrsa/healthcare/index.html", "passage_text": "MRSA is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a type of staph bacteria that is resistant to many antibiotics.

Staphylococcus was first identified in 1880 in Aberdeen, Scotland, by the surgeon Sir Alexander Ogston in pus from a surgical abscess in a knee joint. Although S. aureus is not always pathogenic, it is a common cause of skin infections such as abscesses, respiratory infections such as sinusitis, and food poisoning. Pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing potent protein toxins, and expressing cell-surface proteins that bind and inactivate antibodies."}]
