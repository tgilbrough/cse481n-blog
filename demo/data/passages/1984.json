I've chosen basic plain white 6 x 6 porcelain tile which I was told is pretty cheap. That is $23/sqaure feet."}, {"url": "http://rempros.com/tile_installation_prices.html", "passage_text": "All numbers in the charts are prices to install tile, apply grout and sealer if necessary excluding materials cost.
