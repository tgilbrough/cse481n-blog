A promoter with consensus sequences for the \u221210 and \u221235 regions (boxed) is shown; the sequences of actual promoters deviate from those shown here.

From studies of several promoters at low temperatures (10\u00b0C and below), the equilibrium constant (K 1) for the initial binding of RNA polymerase to form a closed complex has been estimated to be about 10 7 to 10 8 M \u22121 in buffer containing 0.1 M monovalent cation and 0.01 M MgCl 2."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase_I", "passage_text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

It will bind to RNA polymerase and at the same time, associate with the DNA promoter. Transcription factors exist in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. An example of a prokaryotic transcription factor is the Sigma Factor.. The sigma factor is involved in locating RNA polymerase to the correct location. The promoter region is where RNA polymerase binds to DNA to initiate transcription. Not all promoters will have the same sequence. Strong promoters will have a similar nucleotide sequence as a known consensus sequence. Weak promoters will have a different sequence."}, {"url": "http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/RNA-Transcription-by-RNA-Polymerase-Prokaryotes-vs-961", "passage_text": "For example, researchers know that RNA pol II can bind to a DNA sequence within the promoter of many genes, known as the TATA box, to initiate transcription.
