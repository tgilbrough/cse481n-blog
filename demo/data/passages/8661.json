The chlorine gases in the lower stratosphere interact with tiny cloud particles that form at extremely cold temperatures \u2014 below -80 degrees Celsius (-112 degrees Fahrenheit). For example, the CFCs that destroy ozone are also potent greenhouse gases, though they are present in such small concentrations in the atmosphere (several hundred parts per trillion, compared to several hundred parts per million for carbon dioxide) that they are considered a minor player in greenhouse warming."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/how-does_5112209_global-warming-effects-ozone-depletion.html", "passage_text": "Ozone depletion, on the other hand, is the disappearance of ozone. The ozone layer is a dynamic protective layer above the earth; it's a layer approximately nine to 30 miles above the earth in the stratosphere (upper atmosphere). Ozone is actually a greenhouse gas, contributing to trapping heat in the stratosphere. If the ozone layer depletes, it affects the temperature of the earth. The depletion contributes to a global cool down and significant weather changes in higher areas near"}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_does_global_warming_affect_the_ozone_layer", "passage_text": "Scientists now believe that global warming will lead to a weaker ozone layer, because as the surface temperature rises, the stratosphere (where the ozone layer is in the upper part) will get colder, slowing the natural repairing of the ozone layer. A: Yes the global warming affects the ozone layer enormously. The ozone layer is a part of the atmosphere that is nothing but a layer of Ozone gas (O3) that allows the sunlight to penetrate into the atmosphere but reflects back the har \u2026 mful UV (ultra-violet) rays of the sun.

Because our atmosphere is one connected system, it is not surprising that ozone depletion and global warming are related in other ways. For example, evidence suggests that climate change may contribute to thinning of the protective ozone layer. Figure 1. Seasonal thinning of the ozone layer above Antarctica. The ozone hole, however, is not the mechanism of global warming.

Ozone in the troposphere is dangerous to human health because it can cause lung damage and other cardiopulmonary problems when breathed.
