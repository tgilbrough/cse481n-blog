Allow ample space for the mature height and spread of the selected crape myrtle variety: a few feet for miniatures and as much as 25 feet for the larger varieties such as Natchez or Muskogee.

It likes light and warmth, so plant it where it will get full sun all day. Give it extra water during dry periods for the first two years after planting, and it should be able to fend for itself after that.

Crape myrtle cultivars range in height from a tiny 18 inches to an enormous 40 feet. Most plants are in the 15- to 25-foot range and may be considered either a large shrub or small tree. Often crape myrtle grows as a multistemmed small tree, with foliage limited to the upper half of the plant. As a general rule of thumb, plant crape myrtles of this mature size a minimum of 8 to 10 feet from a building wall, and farther if you can. This spacing gives the plant room to expand to its full size. Smaller cultivars of crape myrtle can be planted in groups to use as a hedge or screen. Some of these grow to a compact 3 feet tall and can be planted three feet from a building wall."}]
