Proper ventilation is important to help keep temperatures under control. Greenhouses need an effective ventilation system to maintain air circulation. During the day, greenhouse temperatures should stay between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures in this range encourage plant growth and fruit production. This range also discourages development of certain fungal diseases like gray mold."}, {"url": "http://forums.gardenweb.com/discussions/2180826/lowest-temperature-tomato-plants-can-withstand-in-greenhouse", "passage_text": "I have with my own experience seen my tomato plants take temps in the 40s when I was just a hobby grower with no real damage and I have read in these forums that people have had no problem with tomato plants surviving 40 degree nights when protected from wind in a greenhouse.

That is exactly what the major plant growers (Bonnie, etc) do. They maintain greenhouse temps at minimum 65 degrees to keep the plants growing rapidly. The result is a plant that cannot tolerate temperatures below 65 degrees. All things considered, you would have been better served to have set your plants outdoors in their pots for the day and then back indoors at night.
