I don't think it's necessarily a type a cancer. Even non-cancerous lumps can be spiculated. I believe the word just refers to the shape of the tissue mass. Spiculated masses are star shaped, as opposed to round and smooth. In cancer, a spiculated mass is a lump of tissue with spikes or points on the surface.

Rather than a smooth lump, it has spicules or thin, elongated pieces of tissue sticking out from its perimeter. These spiky tumors can appear anywhere inside the body, but are often found in the breasts or lungs. A spiculated mass will be on the periphery of a breast in instances of breast cancer. Radiotherapy, such as with a linear accelerator, might be used to help treat a spiculated mass."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeekhealth.com/what-is-a-spiculated-mass.htm", "passage_text": "Ad. In cases of breast cancer, a spiculated mass usually exists on the periphery of the breast, not the center, and is typically discovered through ultrasonography or a mammogram, which is a screening that uses radiation to create images of breast tissue.

This scan showed something new about the nodule, it now has spiculation. My regular doctor, who is not a lung or cancer specialist, is adamant that this is malignant cancer...and the internet says spiculations are almost always a sign of malignancy but so far I've found very little information on it. The nodule is small and the report says no adneopathy, I believe that means it hasn't spread, and it's the only nodule there (other than a 30 year old TB scar). It has irregular boarders and low density."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081006234218AAftbzh", "passage_text": "Spiculated mass-it refers to a type of breast cancer.Or give link to translate from English to Greek.Altavista has not it.
