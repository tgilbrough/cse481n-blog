Coeliac disease is caused by an abnormal reaction by your immune system to the protein gluten, found in foods such as bread, pasta, cereals and biscuits. Some people with coeliac disease find eating oats can also trigger symptoms.

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. In celiac disease, the villi become shortened and eventually flatten out. Intestinal damage causes diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients, which may lead to weight loss. Abdominal pain, swelling (distention), and food intolerances are common in celiac disease."}]
