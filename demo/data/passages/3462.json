The Sun passed solar energy to the plants, and plants were eaten by animals. The use of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) is a problem because the burning of these fuels in industry, transport and the generation of electricity releases carbon dioxide (CO2). This is causing global warming and climate change."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/FAQ/4024", "passage_text": "Fossil fuels are a non-renewable source of energy.

Once burned, however, fossil fuels cannot be used again, and they release gases such as carbon dioxide into the air. Such gases are not harmful in small amounts but the demand for energy is so great that millions of tons of these gases are released each year. This causes air pollution, which has a worldwide effect."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/FAQ/4024", "passage_text": "A fossil fuel is any hydrocarbon that may be used as a source of energy.

The age of the organisms and their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years, and sometimes exceeds 650 million years. Fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include coal, petroleum and natural gas. Other more commonly used derivatives of fossil fuels include kerosene and propane."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_are_fossil_fuels", "passage_text": "A fossil fuel is any hydrocarbon that may be used as a source of energy.
