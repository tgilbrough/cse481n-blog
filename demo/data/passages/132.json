Some years back various Connecticut towns banned all fencing over 6 feet high. The local deer fence installers shook their heads but went ahead and installed a bunch of 6-foot deer fences. To their surprise, the fences worked pretty well. High enough to reliably keep out deer. That\u2019s not so high as you might think. The literature says white-tailed deer can jump as high as 12 or even 15 feet. But they generally don\u2019t, because Nature tells them not to.

You can keep deer out of the garden with a fence. That being said, most deer can jump up to 8 feet of fence and some of the larger ones can sometimes clear 10 feet.

"}, {"url": "http://pss.uvm.edu/ppp/articles/deerfences.html", "passage_text": "Just because you have a fence doesn't mean it will be effective at keeping out deer. There are several facts you need to keep in mind when installing such a fence. Height, or width, is probably the most important factor with deer fences, especially if high deer pressure. White-tailed deer can jump almost eight feet high, so effective upright fences against them should be this high. Deer may be able to jump high, but not both high and over a distance. So a fence may not be as high, perhaps six feet, but slanted outward. The deer will try walking under the fence and meet resistance. If you have a standard fence about four or five feet feet high, you can add a similar and additional one about four feet away. While not high, with this width deer usually wont like to try and clear both and perhaps get caught between or on them."}]
