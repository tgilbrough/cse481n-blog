They are 63 to 73 cm long and have an average wingspan of 170 cm. Females are larger and heavier than the males. Females weigh 1550 to 1600 grams, and males weigh 1450 to 1500 grams. Snowy owls are white with brown spots and bars. However, in years when there is very little food, snowy owls do not try to breed. Snowy owls usually lay one clutch of eggs each year. However, if their eggs or chicks die early in the breeding season, a breeding pair may lay another clutch of eggs."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Owl", "passage_text": "The snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) is a large, white owl of the typical owl family.
