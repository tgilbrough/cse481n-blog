Polypoid cnidarians have tentacles and a mouth that face up (think of an anemone or coral). These animals are attached to a substrate or colony of other animals.

They are almost exclusively marine.

All cnidarians are radially symmetrical, and there are two main radially symmetrical body types. The first of these types is known as a polyp."}, {"url": "http://www.mesa.edu.au/cnidaria/", "passage_text": "Cnidaria. Cnidaria is a phylum containing over 9,000 species found only in aquatic and mostly marine environments. All cnidarians have radial symmetrical. There are two major body forms among the Cnidaria-the polyp and the medusa. Sea anemones and corals have the polyp form, while jellyfish are typical medusae. When you look at them, you can see that these body forms are the same except that one is upside down."}]
