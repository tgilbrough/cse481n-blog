Kelvin has its origins in the Scottish language and it is used largely in English. The first name is derived from the English surname, itself of the name of the Scottish river named Kelvin, which is of the Gaelic meaning 'narrow water'. Kelvin is rather popular as a baby boy name. The name grew in popularity from the 1940s up to the 1960s; prior to that, it was of only very light use. Its usage peaked modestly in 1963 with 0.064% of baby boys being named Kelvin. It had a ranking of #210 then. The baby name has dropped in popularity since then."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071212045641AA7P0iD", "passage_text": "This is the basis for the Kelvin scale after Lord Kelvin (1824-1907).
