Each element is given its own chemical symbol, like O for oxygen and Cl for chlorine. Chemical symbols are usually one or two letters long, but sometimes three letters are used. Every chemical symbol starts with a capital letter, with the second or third letters written in lower case. For example, Mg is the correct symbol for magnesium, but mg, mG and MG are wrong"}, {"url": "http://chemistry.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_elements_by_symbol", "passage_text": "List of elements by symbol. 189 pages on this wiki. This is a list of chemical elements by symbol, including the current symbols used to identify the chemical elements as recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, as well as proposed and historical symbols.

For example, C stands for carbon, O stands for oxygen, S stands for sulphur and Na stands for sodium. For a molecule we use the chemical symbols of the atoms it contains to write down its formula. For example the formula for carbon monoxide is CO.

It is usually derived from the name of the element, often in Latin. This is an example of an atomic symbol. The text boxes explain where the numbers are derived from. For example, He is the symbol for helium (English name, not known in ancient Roman times), Pb for lead (plumbum in Latin), W for tungsten (wolfram in German, not known in Roman times).

A chemical formula identifies each constituent element by its chemical symbol and indicates the proportionate number of atoms of each element. In empirical formulas, these proportions begin with a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound, as ratios to the key element."}]
