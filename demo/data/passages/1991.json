Agnatha (Greek, no jaws) is a superclass of jawless fish in the phylum Chordata, subphylum Vertebrata, consisting of both present (cyclostomes) and extinct (conodonts and ostracoderms) species. The group excludes all vertebrates with jaws, known as gnathostomes. The Agnatha are ectothermic or cold blooded, with a cartilaginous skeleton, and the heart contains 2 chambers."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate", "passage_text": "Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which includes the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. A bony fish clade known as the lobe-finned fishes is included with tetrapods, which are further divided into amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. Hagfish do, however, possess a cranium. For this reason, the vertebrate subphylum is sometimes referred to as  Craniata  when discussing morphology. Molecular analysis since 1992 has suggested that the hagfish are most closely related to lampreys, and so also are vertebrates in a monophyletic sense."}, {"url": "http://www.sciencelearningspace.com/2011/09/jawless-fish/", "passage_text": "There are 57,739 species of vertebrates. The majority of these vertebrates can be classified as fish. This includes jawless species of fish and cartilaginous fishes. (Those are fish with skeletons made of cartilage, the same material that makes up your nose.). Fish are almost always ectothermic. There are about 100 species of jawless fish, which can be placed into one of two groups \u2013 the lampreys and the hagfish.
