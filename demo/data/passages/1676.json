Cells that do the same job combine together to form body tissue, such as muscle, skin, or bone tissue. Groups of different types of cells make up the organs in your body, such as your heart, liver, or lungs. Cells continually divide to make more cells for growth and repair in your body. The nucleus contains the information that allows cells to reproduce, or make more cells. Another important part of a cell is the mitochondrion. This is the part of the cell where food and oxygen combine to make energy."}, {"url": "http://www.cancer.org/cancer/livercancer/detailedguide/liver-cancer-what-is-liver-cancer", "passage_text": "The liver is made up mainly of cells called hepatocytes.

The liver is one of the largest, most important, and least appreciated organs in the body. The bulk of the liver consists of hepatocytes, which are epithelial cells with a unique configuration.
