The air cell in the egg enlarges to take up a third of the shell. The egg's weight and the size of its air cell are the main ways to tell if the egg is near the end of its incubation period. The incubation period varies by species and generally takes about a month. When the ducklings begin to crack through their shells at the end of the incubation period, they should all hatch within 24 to 48 hours. Some eggs may fail to hatch."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_long_is_the_incubation_period_for_a_duck", "passage_text": "What temperature for duck egg incubation period?   99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius) is optimum incubating temp. for duck eggs with the temp. being lowered by one degree to 98.5 in the last 3 days of incubat \u2026 ion (25-28th day).

Duck embryo development can be put on hold for about a week prior to incubation by keeping the eggs at 55-60 F (13-15 C).

Incubation of a duck egg is the time period between when the egg is warmed to the correct temperature after laying and when it hatches.

For instance, they eat grass, as do geese, have a similarly long egg incubation period of 35 days (compared with 28 days for ducks), and they don't quack. This is a good trait since they are quiet ducks. The male has a low breathy call, and the female a quiet trilling coo. Muscovy ducks are great mothers and do a good job raising their young. Muscovy take longer to hatch than other poultry... an egg takes 33 to 35 days to hatch. A chicken, for example, hatches in 21 days. Muscovy meat is one of the healthiest meats on the market today, being 98% or greater fat free."}, {"url": "http://www.duckhealth.com/hatcduck.html", "passage_text": "Natural Incubation. Duck eggs may be hatched naturally by placing them under a broody duck or even a broody chicken hen. Muscovy ducks are very good setters, capable of hatching 12-15 duck eggs. The nest box should be located in a clean dry shelter, bedded with suitable litter. Since duck eggs are larger than chicken eggs, setting trays must be designed to accommodate their larger size. Eggs from common ducks like Pekins require 28 days to hatch. Eggs from Muscovy ducks hatch in about 35 days after setting.
