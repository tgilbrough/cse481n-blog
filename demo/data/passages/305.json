At one time fungi were grouped with plants. Later biologists realized that the organisms in the fungi were different from plants in many ways and were placed in their own kingdom. Algae is a term used for aquatic organisms that photosynthesize like land plants yet are structurally less complex and lack vascular tissue (xylem and phloem) found in most plants. Plants that lack these specialized vessels for water transport are called bryophytes (see Plant Kingdom)"}, {"url": "http://www.vegetablegardener.com/item/4148/give-your-garden-a-seaweed-boost", "passage_text": "The sea water that provides seaweed with nutrients also carries bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

The body of algae is called thallus. It may be unicellular or multicellular. Generally the algae are classified into three groups based on the presence of photosynthetic and accessory pigments. They are brown, red and green algae. Algae possess the green colouring matter known as chlorophyll. Fungi never possess chlorophyll. Algae are autotrophs i e., they can prepare their own food from simple inorganic materials with the help of chlorophyll and photosynthesis.
