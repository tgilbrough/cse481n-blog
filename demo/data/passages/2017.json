A manufacturing execution system (MES) is a control system for managing and monitoring work-in-process on a factory floor. An MES keeps track of all manufacturing information in real time, receiving up-to-the-minute data from robots, machine monitors and employees. Although manufacturing execution systems used to operate as self-contained systems, they are increasingly being integrated with enterprise resource planning (ERP) software suites. The goal of a manufacturing execution system is to improve productivity and reduce cycle-time, the total time to produce an order. By integrating an MES with ERP software, factory managers can be proactive about ensuring the delivery of quality products in a timely, cost-effective manner"}, {"url": "http://www.ibaset.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wp-iBASEt-Paper-What-Is-MES-In-Complex-Discrete-Manufacturing.pdf", "passage_text": "What is MES in Complex Discrete Manufacturing \u00a9 Copyright 2014 Page 27 of 28 2.9.4.
