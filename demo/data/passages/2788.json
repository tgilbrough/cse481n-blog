Definition. noun. (1) The movement of action potential along a nerve fiber in response to a stimulus (such as touch, pain, heat or cold). (2) The relaying of a coded signal that travels along a nerve cell membrane to an effector, such as muscle, gland or another nerve cell. Supplement. A nerve impulse is the relaying of a coded signal from a nerve cell to an effector (a muscle cell, a gland cell or another nerve cell) in response to a stimulus. It is the means by which a nerve cell communicates with another cell."}, {"url": "http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/understanding-the-transmission-of-nerve-impulses.html", "passage_text": "Transmission of a nerve impulse: Resting potential and action potential.
