The sarcomere is responsible for the striated appearance of skeletal muscle, and forms the basic machinery necessary for muscle contraction. Skeletal muscle is a form of striated muscle tissue which is under the voluntary control of the somatic nervous system. It is one of three major muscle types, the others being cardiac muscle and smooth muscle.

A whole skeletal muscle is considered an organ of the muscular system. Each organ or muscle consists of skeletal muscle tissue, connective tissue, nerve tissue, and blood or vascular tissue. Skeletal muscles vary considerably in size, shape, and arrangement of fibers. An individual skeletal muscle may be made up of hundreds, or even thousands, of muscle fibers bundled together and wrapped in a connective tissue covering. Each muscle is surrounded by a connective tissue sheath called the epimysium. Fascia, connective tissue outside the epimysium, surrounds and separates the muscles."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle", "passage_text": "Skeletal muscle is made up of individual muscle cells or myocytes, known as muscle fibers.

The muscle fibers that make up skeletal muscle are called myofibers and consist of long, cylindrical, multinucleated cells. These cells are made of actin and myosin fibers repeated as a sacromere. Therefore skeletal muscle cells are long, cylindrical, multinucleated cells made of actin and myosin myofibers.
