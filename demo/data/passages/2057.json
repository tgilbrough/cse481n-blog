Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein secreted by the placenta during pregnancy that consists of an alpha and beta subunit. The alpha subunit is structurally similar to the alpha subunits of FSH, LH and TSH. The beta subunit is distinct for hCG. Current pregnancy tests is available that can test either serum or urine. Once a specimen is applied to the device, results are available in 3 minutes for urine and 5 minutes for serum. Sensitivity is 10 IU/mL for serum and 20 mIU/mL for urine. hCG concentrations reach 10 to 25 mIU/mL by 7 to10 days after conception."}, {"url": "http://www.pregnancylab.net/2011/01/the-many-faces-of-hcg.html", "passage_text": "1 During pregnancy, most of the hCG in the blood is intact hCG. 2  Nicked hCG (hCGn): Nicked hCG is made when a chemical bond in part of the beta subunit is broken. 1 The beta subunit is unique to just hCG (the other three hormones also have their own unique beta subunit). 2  A complete, intact hCG molecule is made when the alpha and beta subunits are attached to each other. 3 "}, {"url": "https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/hcg/tab/test", "passage_text": "Qualitative hCG testing detects the presence of hCG and is routinely used to screen for a pregnancy. This test may be performed by a laboratory, at a doctor's office, or at home using a home pregnancy test kit. The blood level of hcG in a woman with an ectopic pregnancy usually rises at a slower rate than normal. Typically, hCG levels double about every two days for the first four weeks of a normal pregnancy, then slow to every 31/2 days by six weeks."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/baby/human-chorionic-gonadotropin-hcg", "passage_text": "Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG).
