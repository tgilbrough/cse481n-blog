Please give useful advice...Thank You 5000mcg Sincerely, Brooklyn. Report Abuse. Give it about 2 weeks or so to see results. Take two a day and take the pills with a meal.

I have just jumped on the 2,500 mcg Biotin and Flaxseed oil regimen about two weeks ago. I try not to be impatient but I wonder how long it will take for me to see some real results. I can tell the flaxseed is making my hair softer b/c I can feel the texture is more slippery or well oiled."}, {"url": "http://www.curlcentric.com/biotin-for-hair-growth/", "passage_text": "Im concerned about my weight so I would rather take the supplement than eat all those unneccessary calorie from intaking the biotin through foods like breads and cereals. It takes about 3 months to notice results .and you have to take everyday.i will be taking it for 2 year until I reach my hair goal. Also a bottle cost 5 dollar at walmart for 120 capsule,so what do u have to lose. Hair grows. That\u2019s what it does. Biotin makes your hair STRONGER so it CAN grow, which is not the same. Taking biotin and not doing anything else for your hair will be just as unproductive as doing nothing to care for your hair."}]
