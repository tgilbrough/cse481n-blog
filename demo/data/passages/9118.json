There are upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons, with the cell type described above being a lower motor neuron. Upper motor neurons are cortico-spinal interneurons that arise from the motor cortex and descend to the spinal cord where they activate the lower motor neurons through synapses."}, {"url": "http://health.howstuffworks.com/human-body/systems/nervous-system/nerve1.htm", "passage_text": "1 Motor neurons (motoneurons) carry signals from the central nervous system to the outer parts (muscles, skin, glands) of your body. 2  Receptors sense the environment (chemicals, light, sound, touch) and encode this information into electrochemical messages that are transmitted by sensory neurons.

Nerve consists of myelinated and unmyelinated axons passing to the cell body (dorsal root ganglion cell), from which nerve passes into the Spinal Cord and the CNS. These may be purely motor (musculocutaneous), purely sensory (cutaneous nerve of arm) or, usually, mixed (radial, median, ulnar, femoral, and sciatic).

Sensory neurons are nerve cells that transmit sensory information (sight, sound, feeling, etc.).
