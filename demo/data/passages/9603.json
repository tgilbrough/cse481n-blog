[{"url": "http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/transistor1.htm", "passage_text": "Transistors are devices that control the movement of electrons, and consequently, electricity. They work something like a water faucet -- not only do they start and stop the flow of a current, but they also control the amount of the current. The point of contact was called a junction, thus the name junction transistor. With an electrical current applied to the center layer (called the base), electrons will move from the N-type side to the P-type side. The initial small trickle acts as a switch that allows much larger current to flow."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor", "passage_text": "Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. Today, some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits. Collector current is approximately \u03b2 (common-emitter current gain) times the base current. It is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications. Unlike the field-effect transistor (see below), the BJT is a low\u2013input-impedance device."}, {"url": "http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae430.cfm", "passage_text": "The design of a transistor allows it to function as an amplifier or a switch. This is accomplished by using a small amount of electricity to control a gate on a much larger supply of electricity, much like turning a valve to control a supply of water. The base pulls these electrons from the emitter because it has a more positive voltage than does the emitter. This movement of electrons creates a flow of electricity through the transistor. The current passes from the emitter to the collector through the base."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor", "passage_text": "A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch electronic signals and electrical power.

Best Answer: There are at least two types, FET (Field Effect) and BJT (Bi Junction). I'll kind of mash up the two in the explanation. A transistor has three connections. There is one connection that is a current source, one that acts as a gate, and another where the current leaves. As a small signal is provided at the gate, a larger current passes through the transistor. This allows it to provide amplification. "}, {"url": "http://www.explainthatstuff.com/howtransistorswork.html", "passage_text": "A transistor is a miniature electronic component that can do two different jobs. It can work either as an amplifier or a switch: 1  When it works as an amplifier, it takes in a tiny electric current at one end (an input current) and produces a much bigger electric current (an output current) at the other. 2  Transistors can also work as switches. Normally, the holes in the base act like a barrier, preventing any significant current flow from the emitter to the collector while the transistor is in its off state. A transistor works when the electrons and the holes start moving across the two junctions between the n-type and p-type silicon. Let's connect the transistor up to some power. Suppose we attach a small positive voltage to the base, make the emitter negatively charged, and make the collector positively charged"}, {"url": "http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/transistor.htm", "passage_text": "If cells are the building blocks of life, transistors are the building blocks of the digital revolution.
