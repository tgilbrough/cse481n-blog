They cause things like colds, influenza, measles, mumps, malaria, AIDS and so on. The job of your immune system is to protect your body from these infections. The immune system protects you in three different ways: 1  It creates a barrier that prevents bacteria and viruses from entering your body."}, {"url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQGOcOUBi6s", "passage_text": "Every second of your life you are under attack. Bacteria, viruses, spores and more living stuff wants to enter your body and use its resources for itself. The immune system is a powerful army of cells that fights like a T-Rex on speed and sacrifices itself for your survival. Without it you would die in no time.

Opsonised bacteria are, therefore, coated with molecules that phagocytic cells recognise and respond to. The alternative complement pathway does not require antibody to initiate the lysis of bacteria. In this pathway, complement proteins from a complex known as C3 directly bind to bacteria and activate downstream components in the complement cascade, once again ending in formation of MAC that causes lysis of the bacterium."}, {"url": "http://bitesized.immunology.org/pathogens-and-disease/immune-responses-to-bacteria/", "passage_text": "Via complement-mediated lysis. When bacteria, such as Neisseria meningitidis, invade the body, they are attacked by immune proteins called complement proteins. Complement proteins assist in bacterial killing via three pathways, the classical complement pathway, the alternative complement pathway or the lectin pathway.

The first is a rapid-onset innate response against the virus, which involves the synthesis of proteins called interferons and the stimulation of natural killer lymphocytes.

The symptoms of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue. Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis."}, {"url": "http://www.biology.arizona.edu/immunology/tutorials/AIDS/response.html", "passage_text": "The immune system protects the body from invading disease-causing organisms, or pathogens.

The innate immune system is a primary defense mechanism against invading organisms, while the adaptive immune system acts as a second line of defense.
