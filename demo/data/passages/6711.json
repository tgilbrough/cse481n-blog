Phosphorus is present in plants and animals. There is over 1 lb (454 grams) of phosphorus in the human body. It is a component of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a fundamental energy source in living things. Phosphoric acid is primarily used in the production of phosphate compounds. It is also used in pickling metals, in sugar refining, and in soft drinks. Phosphorus forms a number of compounds with the halogens, e.g., the trichloride, PCl 3, and the pentachloride, PCl. , both used as reagents."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080306002322AA4IQzh", "passage_text": "Report Abuse.
