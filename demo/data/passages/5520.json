Therefore, an indoor drop in temperature at night of less than 10\u00baF will not significantly delay seedling emergence. The effect of soil temperature on sown seeds. The chart below displays the relationship between soil temperature, days to emergence, and the percentage of sown seeds to germinate: As you might expect, the percentage of any seeds to germinate is maximum at the optimal temperature for that species."}, {"url": "http://homeguides.sfgate.com/dill-germination-problems-75459.html", "passage_text": "If you're planting dill in rows, keep the rows 2 feet apart.

If temperatures are too warm (over 75), the seedlings will grow too fast and get weak and leggy. Most seedlings grow fine in air temperatures as low as 50 degrees, as long as soil temperature is maintained at about 65 to 70. After your seedlings are six to eight weeks old, you can transplant them into larger pots with a coarser growing medium, such as our Transplant Mix.

Broccoli: is best germinated indoors at temps of about 85\u00b0F, 6 weeks before you plan to transplant. Celery: is best germinated indoors at 75-85\u00b0F.
