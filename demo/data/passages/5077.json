The console has an RTD port used normally for Venus scoreboards. It is a simple 19200 baud 8N1 serial signal, and carries the running time, splits, and swimmer names. Decoded data is fed into Autobahn with python and then to the browser for graphic rendering. The decoder can be put into test mode by resetting with the split button set to the OFF position.
