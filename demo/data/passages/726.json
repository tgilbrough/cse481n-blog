These measurements are extremely important when buying or selling a piece of property. You also may have to measure acres or feet if you are planning a landscaping or building project. An acre is equal to 43,560 square feet. There are multiple combinations of measurements in feet that will equal the product of 43,560. Each side of the square should equal 208.71 feet, which is equal to 1 acre. Create different shapes that equal an acre by dividing the product 43,560 by various values. For instance, you could have a lot that was 150 feet on two of the sides and 290.4 feet on the other two sides."}, {"url": "http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/science/acre-measure-land-area.html", "passage_text": "acre. acre, measure of land area used in the English units of measurement.
