The average cost to run a dryer for an hour depends on the power consumed by the dryer in an hour. Some dryers are electric and others run on gas, but electric dryers notoriously consume more energy than gas dryers do. The label on the back of the dryer should indicate the watts it uses. Electric companies charge by the kilowatt hour, so calculating how much it costs to run an electric dryer starts with finding out the kilowatts it takes to run the dryer for an hour."}, {"url": "http://www.chegg.com/homework-help/questions-and-answers/much-cost-run-1500-w-hair-dryer-21-minutes-day-one-month-30-days-cost-9-per-kwh-q1346979", "passage_text": "Question.

Best Answer: you are running it for 0.5 hours so 1500 * 0.5 = 750 Wh Since the cost is in kWh i will divide this result by 1000 to get it in K 750/1000 kWh = 0.75 kWh 1kWh costs 0.12$, so 0.75 kWh will cost, (0.75 * 0.12) $ = 0.09 $.

For an exact calculation of how much it costs to run your dryer, use this formula: (dryer's wattage x length of load in hours)/1000 = kilowatt hours (kwh) used. kilowatt hours x cost per kwh = cost per load. cost per load x # of loads per month = cost per month. cost per month x 12 = cost per year. Here are the calculations that I ran for my dryer: (5600 watts x .667 hours)/1000 = 3.73 kwh. 3.73 kwh x .09 = $.34 per load. $.34 per load x 24 loads a month = $8.16 per month. $8.16 x 12 = $97.92 per year. *based on a 5600 watt dryer, 40 minute run-time and a $.12 per kwh rate."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_much_does_a_hair_dryer_cost", "passage_text": "To run a (our) gas dryer...
