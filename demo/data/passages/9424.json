When Venus is in the middle of the Sun and Earth, it is at its closest point to Earth. During this period, Venus would be the closest planet to Earth. However, there are times when Mars is actually the closest planet. For example, during August 2003, Earth and Mars were at such a point in their orbits that Mars was at one of its closest distances to Earth.

When Venus and Earth are at their closest approach to each other, it is called opposition. Incredibly, the distance between the planets can vary at different oppositions. 38 million km is the closest opposition possible for the two planets. The distance between the planets can vary by as much as 223 million km during their orbits. Even though Venus is the closest planet to Earth, it is a very inhospitable world. The hottest temperature here on Earth was recorded in the Lut desert in 2005. That temperature was 70.7\u00b0C."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_closest_planet_to_the_earth", "passage_text": "The planet that is closest to Earth depends on where the other planets are in relation to Earth.

So the distance between Earth and any other planet changes over a wide range, depending on whether we're both on the same side of the sun or on opposite sides.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth and second closest to the sun. It was named after the Roman goddess of love and is often referred to as Earth's sister planet because of their similar size and composition. The atmosphere of Venus is filled with clouds of carbon dioxide and the surface is a dry desert.

The minimum distance between us and Venus is about 25.5 million miles, or about 28% of the distance from earth to the sun. ======================================. While we're on the subject, this is also a good time to mention Mars. After Venus, Mars is the next nearest planet to Earth.
