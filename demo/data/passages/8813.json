Reticulated foams are extremely open foams i.e. there are few, if any, intact bubbles or cell windows. In contrast, the foam formed by soap bubbles is composed solely of intact (fully enclosed) bubbles. In a reticulated foam only the lineal boundaries where the bubbles meet (Plateau borders) remain. A description of the structure of reticulated foams is still being developed. While Plateau's laws, the rules governing the shape of soap films in foams were developed in the 19th century, a mathematical description of the structure is still debated. The computer-generated Weaire\u2013Phelan structure is the most recent."}, {"url": "http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/units/pdf/18458.pdf", "passage_text": "Performance criteria 1.1 Reticulated services are described in terms of their general characteristics, ownership, access and occurrence.
