For the Fahrenheit scale, there is an equivalent absolute scale called the Rankin (R) scale. 0\u00b0 Rankin = -459.69\u00b0F The absolute scales, Kelvin and Rankin, are only equal at 0\u00b0. For every degree increase in K, you increase R by 1.8\u00b0, so they will never be equal again until you reach infinity. So, the only possible point at which all four of the temperature scales can possibly be equal is at infinity. You simply add 273.15 to a Kelvin reading to get the Celsius value. You have to use a conversion factor between Celsius and Fahrenheit and between Kelvin and Fahrenheit, you have to first convert Kelvins to degrees Celsius to then convert to degrees Fahrenheit."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_is_fahrenheit_celsius_and_kelvin_the_same", "passage_text": "Absolute zero is -273.15 degrees Celsius and is the lowest possible temperature.
