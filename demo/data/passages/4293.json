High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) (also called glucose-fructose, isoglucose and glucose-fructose syrup) is a sweetener made from corn starch that has been processed by glucose isomerase to convert some of its glucose into fructose. Corn syrups, including HFCS, are made from corn starch. Commercial production of corn syrup began in 1864. In the late 1950s scientists at Clinton Corn Processing Company in Iowa tried to turn glucose from corn starch into fructose, but the process was not scalable."}, {"url": "http://www.eatingwell.com/nutrition_health/nutrition_news_information/is_high_fructose_corn_syrup_bad_for_you", "passage_text": "A.

Its main function in recipes is to provide sweetness and moisture, and to prevent the crystallization of sugar. It provides a smooth texture to cooked sweets, such as candies, as well as no-bake recipes, such as ice cream. Karo light and dark corn syrups perform similarly in recipes and can usually be used interchangeably. Recipes usually specify which type to use but the choice may be guided by personal preference. Typically, light corn syrup is used when a delicately sweet flavor is desired, such as in fruit sauces and jams."}, {"url": "http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/high-fructose-corn-syrup-vs-corn-syrup-the-facts.html", "passage_text": "Both high fructose corn syrup and corn syrup are frequently used in processed foods in place of sugar.
