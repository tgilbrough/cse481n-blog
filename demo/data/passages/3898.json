In North America, there are about 25 species of snakes able to secrete toxin. Consequently, almost any type of venomous snake bite can be encountered in the US. About 7,000 snake bites are reported in the US per year, but because snake bites are not required to be reported, it is estimated that up to 45,000 bites per year may occur with about 8,000 by poisonous snakes."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071019194531AAqqugH", "passage_text": "A pin prick or a cat scratch at worst.

Snakes will rub against rough surfaces to shed their skin. A shed skin is much longer than the snake that shed it, as the skin covers the top and bottom of each scale. If the skin is shed intact, each scale is unwrapped on the top and bottom side of the scale which almost doubles the length of the shed skin.

I have had some pretty serious exercise of this skill this week. In the past three days, I have found three fairly fresh snake sheds on islands in the Matanzas River. Most often, though, a shed is either torn apart by the snake as it sheds, or tears itself apart as a result of drying out (it is wet when the snake sheds it off, as a result of lymphatic fluid excreted by the snake\u2019s integument to aid in the shedding process)."}, {"url": "http://www.snake-removal.com/shedskin.html", "passage_text": "How can you tell what type of snake left behind a shed snake skin? This is very difficult for non-experts. I have found that most non-herpetologists have difficulty identifying a complete snake upon seeing it. But just the skin, it's even harder to identify what kind of snake shed a particular skin. All non-venomous North American snake results will be mailed out to you.

Whatever you do, avoid the knee-jerk reaction to pull your finger or whatever out of the snake's mouth. If a snake bites you and lets go quickly, it is no problem.
