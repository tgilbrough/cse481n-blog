The cost could range anywhere from $10,000 to $250,000 and beyond. Think about your first encounter with a video game and how it looked. These figures concerning app development in the US seem to be in line with those published elsewhere; an article on PadGadget.com explores the cost of building an iPad app and suggested the development costs alone range from about $12,000 to $150,000."}, {"url": "http://codewithchris.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app/", "passage_text": "Finally, let\u2019s put some concrete numbers on these two options so you can really get an idea of how much an app costs. Getting an app development company to build your app can cost from $10,000 to $60,000 for a small to medium sized app. The range is so big because it will really depend on the complexity of the app and number of screens. The prices for these services and software vary but can range from $10 a month to a one time cost of $5000. It\u2019s difficult to nail down where on the scale this option fits because of these big price ranges. There are even free app makers out there but as you can expect, they\u2019re not very full featured."}, {"url": "http://www.mobiblossom.com/pricing.html", "passage_text": "For Android the average cost for an app is on par with Apple at $6,500.

The $750,000 includes $120,000 of operational dollars for legal, accounting, and comparable fees. So, with this last category completed, we have yet another answer: 1  Apps built by the largest app companies, the big boys, likely cost anywhere between $500,000 to $1,000,000. 2  Apps built by agencies like savvy apps cost anywhere between $150,000 to $450,000."}, {"url": "http://www.thinslices.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app/", "passage_text": "Costs vary according to the type of app you want to create.
