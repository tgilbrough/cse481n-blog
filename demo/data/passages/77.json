The cost of a chicken per pound also varies on the basis of male and female chicken; for example if you buy male chicken its cost will come to around $.67 and $2.3 per pound, and for a female chicken its cost comes around for $2 to $4.5 per pound. Overall the average cost of a chicken per pound is $2.25."}, {"url": "http://www.mymoneyblog.com/costco-rotisserie-chicken-vs-homemade.html", "passage_text": "According to the BLS, the national average price of a whole chicken is around $1.50 a pound. At Costco, the price for a Foster\u2019s Farm whole chicken was $1.29 a pound. That\u2019s 23% less than the $1.67/lb. for the rotisserie chicken. Supermarket chickens cost more, but their rotisserie chickens also run closer to $8 a bird. If you go organic, in my experience the price is double non-organic."}, {"url": "http://athriftymom.com/foster-farms-chicken-low-as-99-lb/", "passage_text": "They have Foster Farms fresh Boneless/Skinless chicken breast on Price Cut through 6/5 for $1.99 per pound \u2013 normally $4.99 per pound!
