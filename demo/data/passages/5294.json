Said dreams usually revolve around owning a gorilladillo (a cross between a gorilla and an armadillo). Apparently, I might be closer to achieving that goal than I thought. You wouldn't think that the animals below are real, but there are many living examples of such creatures. Unfortunately, most (not all) hybrids end up being sterile so they cannot be bred even further.

Hybrid animals are the offspring produced when two animals of closely related \u2013 but different \u2013 species breed.

The liger is a hybrid cross between a male lion (Panthera leo) and a female tiger (Panthera tigris). Thus, the liger has parents of the same genus but of different species. The liger is distinct from the similar hybrid tigon. While the Siberian tiger is the largest pure sub-species, ligers are believed to be the largest of all known extant felines. Ligers exist only in captivity or zoos because the habitats of the parental species do not overlap in the wild. Other big cat hybrids can reach similar sizes; the litigon, a rare hybrid of a male lion and a female tigon, is roughly the same size as the liger, with a male named Cubanacan (at the Alipore Zoo in India) reaching 363 kg (800 lb)."}]
