The process of loosening the chaff from the grain so as to remove it is called threshing \u2013 traditionally done by milling or pounding. Separating remaining loose chaff from the grain is called winnowing \u2013 traditionally done by repeatedly tossing the grain up into a light wind which gradually blows the lighter chaff away."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_husk_of_a_grain_called", "passage_text": "The beard portion of the seed head of a cereal grain plant is  called, collectively, awns.

Cereal grains which have such beards or awns are wheat,  barley, rye and triticale.

To get rid of the useless chaff the material is tossed into the air, preferably on a windy day in a process called winnowing. The wind blows the feather light chaff away and the heavier grain falls to the canvas. The term means to separate the seeds of grain from the husks and straw. Some types of grains are wheat, oats, barley and rice. Early threshing was done by laying out a canvas tarp, breaking open a sheave of wheat and spreading it in an even, shallow way."}, {"url": "http://www.agintheclassroom.org/TeacherResources/TerraNova/clr_wheatnews.pdf", "passage_text": "Thresh: to beat the stems and husks of grain or cereal plants with a machine to separate the grains and seeds.
