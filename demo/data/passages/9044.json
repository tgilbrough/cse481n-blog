Terrazzo artisans create walls, floors, patios, and panels by exposing marble chips and other fine aggregates on the surface of finished concrete or epoxy-resin. Much of the preliminary work of terrazzo workers is similar to that of cement masons. Marble-chip, cementitious terrazzo requires three layers of materials. First, cement masons or terrazzo workers build a solid, level concrete foundation that is three to four inches deep. After the forms are removed from the foundation, workers add a one-inch layer of sandy concrete. Consisting originally of marble chips, clay, and goat milk (as the sealer), production of terrazzo became much easier after the 1920s and the introduction of electric industrial grinders and other power equipment."}, {"url": "http://www.nationalterrazzo.com/com_floor.htm", "passage_text": "In general, terrazzo is a mixture of marble chips and colored cement or epoxy that is poured into an area and given time to cure.

Terrazzo is a composite material poured in place or precast, which is used for floor and all treatments. It consists of marble, quartz, granite, glass or other suitable chips, sprinkled or unsprinkled, and poured with a binder that is cementitious, chemical (such as epoxy or acrylic) or a combination of both. Divider strips are used to create panels for terrazzo floor when using different colors of cement and stones. These divider strips can be made of zinc, brass, alloy or even wood. After the terrazzo floor is poured into the divider strips, it is then grinded using stone or diamond abrasives."}, {"url": "http://nurazzo.com/", "passage_text": "Terrazzo floors have always been known for their classic look, durability, longevity, and low cost of maintenance.

Poured in place terrazzo is cured and then ground and polished to the desired surface finish.

Traditionally, terrazzo is comprised of marble chips embedded into a cement base, then ground flat and coated with a topical sealer. Although marble is still the aggregate of choice for most applications, terrazzo can also be made from recycled glass and metallics, as well as natural aggregates such as mother of pearl. Terrazzo can also be set into precision cut forms to create logos, medallions, text, or any abstract pattern imaginable."}]
