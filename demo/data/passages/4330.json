Cantaloupe is a hot-weather plant, and the quickest-growing varieties require at least 70 days of frost-free temperatures to reach maturity. Cantaloupes grow best when directly seeded into the garden. The roots tolerate very little disturbance; only an experienced gardener should attempt to transplant seedlings."}, {"url": "http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/newsletters/hortupdate/hortupdate_archives/2001/apr01/h2apr01.html", "passage_text": "For instance, the optimum soil temperature for seed germination of vegetable crops such as cucumber, cantaloupe, okra, pumpkin, squash and watermelon is 95 degrees F, but the heat of summer will decrease yields and plant vigor. Soil temperatures at which vegetable seed will grow are classified into four categories-the minimum temperature required for seed growth, an optimum temperature, a realistic soil temperature and, maximized temperature above which little germination will occur."}, {"url": "http://www.almanac.com/plant/cantaloupe", "passage_text": "You want the fruit to get the air. Cantaloupes like temps at 70\u00b0 to 80\u00b0F, well-draining compost/soil with a phH of 6 to 6.5, and 1 to 2 inches of water per week, ideally in the morning; about three weeks before harvesting, cut back on watering by half to a third. Fertilize every 2 to 3 weeks with a 5-5-5. Cantaloupe requires 35 to 45 days to mature from flowering, depending on the temperature. Female blossoms have a small swelling or bulb at the base of the flower. Keep in mind that cantaloupe blossoms have a pollination window of one day."}, {"url": "http://tomclothier.hort.net/page11.html", "passage_text": "That is the fundamental relationship between germination and temperature. For every species of seed, there is an optimal soil temperature for germination, and at that temperature, the maximum number of seeds will germinate and in less time than at any other temperature."}, {"url": "http://reimerseeds.com/Seed-Planting/Cantaloupe-Melon-Seeds/Cantaloupes-Melons-Germination.aspx", "passage_text": "Plant the seeds 1 when soil has warmed up. The seeds may rot and not sprout if the soil is too cool. Germination is improved when soil temperature is above 60 F. Plant the seeds in hills. Plants grow 1 ft tall and vines spread up to 10 ft. Soil Requirements: Requires fertile slightly acid soil in a well drained location in the garden.

Germination time for watermelons is between three and 12 days; the seeds require warm temperatures -- 70 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit -- to develop a healthy seedling. Watermelon seeds also need plenty of room to grow; seeds should be at least five feet away from each other. When temperatures are in the high 70s Fahrenheit, the seeds take about five days for germination. Seeds planted in slightly warmer conditions, such as the middle to upper 80s Fahrenheit, will sprout a seedling in four days."}, {"url": "http://parkseed.com/ambrosia-hybrid-cantaloupe-seeds/p/05178-PK-P1/", "passage_text": "The ideal temperature to germinate most seeds is approximately 70 degrees F; give or take 1-2 degrees either way. This would be a good germination temperature for most flower and vegetable seeds and would be the most practical and feasible temperatures achieved for gardeners starting seeds in the home.

Cantaloupes typically need 1 to 2 inches of water per week. Water less when fruits start to ripen for better flavor. 3. Plan to transplant cantaloupe seedlings when they reach about 2 inches in height and have two or more true leaves. Transplant when all danger of frost has passed and daytime temperatures range between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit."}, {"url": "http://www.gardenguides.com/110105-cantaloupe-seeds-germinate.html", "passage_text": "Overview. Cantaloupe is a summer treat that is suitable for many home gardens. When ripe, these melons have sweet, orange flesh that is used in fruit salads or served on its own. A warm-season plant, cantaloupe doesn't tolerate frost and cool soil temperatures inhibit germination. Planting cantaloupe indoors allows you to control the climate properly to ensure germination, while also protecting the young plants from disease and insects until they become established. Cover the pots with a plastic bag, which helps preserve moisture in the soil during germination. Set the pots in a warm, 75 to 90 degree Fahrenheit, room to germinate. Best germination occurs at 90 F."}]
