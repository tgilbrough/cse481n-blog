"}, {"url": "http://www.carcalluk.com/What-is-a-pinched-nerve/", "passage_text": "A pinched nerve is a nerve with pressure applied to it, in terms of a whiplash injury this is usually caused by a herniated disc pressing against it. Pinched nerves in the spine tend to happen in the neck and lower back as these are the areas that do the most moving. The symptoms of a pinched nerve include weakness, tenderness, prickly sensation, tingling sensation or stabbing sensations in the limbs or areas of the body where the nerves are linked to. In this case the \u2018disease\u2019 in question is the pressure applied to the nerve from a herniated disc as a result of the extreme forces applied to the neck from a whiplash type injury. Treatment for this is the same as that for a herniated disc or possibly a fractured vertebrae, as they are the root cause of this condition."}, {"url": "http://www.painneck.com/pinched-nerve-causes", "passage_text": "Pinched Nerve in Neck Causes. To better understand causes of a pinched nerve in the neck, conditions of the cervical spine should be examined. As it leaves the spine, a nerve can be affected by an unwanted condition such as a neck bone spur (osteophytes) or a bulging, or herniated neck disc compressing the nerve. As previously mentioned, pinched nerve in neck causes are typically brought on by spinal conditions although in some cases they can be mistaken for pinched nerve in the shoulder so it's best to make an appointment with a licensed medical practioner to receive a proper examination."}, {"url": "http://injuryinformation.com/injuries/pinched-nerve.php", "passage_text": "This pressure causes inflammation of the nerve and disrupts the nerve's function. If a nerve is pinched for only a short time, there's typically no permanent damage. Once the pressure is relieved, nerve function returns to normal. However, if the pressure continues, chronic pain and permanent nerve damage can occur. Causes. A pinched nerve occurs when too much pressure (compression) is applied to a nerve by surrounding tissues. In some cases, this tissue might be bone or cartilage \u2014 such as in the case of a herniated spinal disk that compresses a nerve root. In other cases, muscle or tendons may be the culprits."}, {"url": "http://drscottcady.com/CTPinchednervesCS.htm", "passage_text": "TMJ and jaw pain. Degeneration of the cervical spine can result in several different conditions that cause problems. These are usually divided between problems that come from mechanical problems in the neck and problems which come from nerves being irritated or pinched.

This pressure disrupts the nerve's function, causing pain, tingling, numbness or weakness. A pinched nerve can occur anywhere in your body. A herniated disk in your lower spine, for example, may put pressure on a nerve root, causing pain that radiates down the back of your leg (sciatica). Likewise, a pinched nerve in your wrist can lead to pain and numbness in your hand and fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome). Causes.

When the cervical spine (neck) is subject to whiplash, there is usually a combination of factors that contribute to whiplash pain in the neck and back, and ultimately need to be addressed individually by a chiropractor. The force of whiplash can cause injury to the discs between the vertebrae, and small tears can develop. If the gelatinous middle of the disc seeps out, it can irritate the nerve endings in this area. This is known as disc derangement."}, {"url": "http://www.spine-health.com/treatment/chiropractic/sources-whiplash-pain", "passage_text": "Whiplash Pain from a Herniated Disc.
