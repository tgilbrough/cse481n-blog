Faults or cracks occur because of this formation, this causes the land to either lift up into a mountain or drop down to form lowlands. The Kanto Plain is the largest stretch of lowlands in Japan. The tallest mountain in Japan is Mount Fuji which is an also an active volcano. Japan is located in the Ring of Fire, one of the world's most active volcanic area.
