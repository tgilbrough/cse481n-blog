So far I've found that cupro is the European cousin of Tencel\u00ae, which in turn is the registered trade name for Lyocell, a biodegradable fabric made from wood pulp cellulose. I'm interested if anyone has heard of cupro or can confirm whether the above information is correct. Here's the jacket and it's definitely European made. I've attached a close-up shot of the fabric around the button but it's black so it's difficult to see."}]
