The kinetic energy of an electron accelerated through a potential difference of V volts is given by the equation: mv 2 = eV where e is the electron charge (1.6x10 -19 C) [You must be given the electron charge and Planck's constant in order to answer this question]."}, {"url": "http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bart/book/ex009.htm", "passage_text": "Wavelength of a photon and an electron-Example. The wavelength of a 2 eV photon is given by: l = h c / Eph = 6.625 x 10 -34 x 3 x 10 8 /(1.6 x 10 -19 x 2) = 621 nm. where the photon energy was multiplied with the electronic charge to convert the energy in Joule rather than electron Volt. The kinetic energy of an electron is related to its momentum by: T = p2/2m. from which we find the momentum, p : p = (2mT) 1/2 = (2 x 9.1 x 10 -31 x 1.6 x 10 -19 x 2) 1/2 = 7.63 x 10 -25 kg m/s.
