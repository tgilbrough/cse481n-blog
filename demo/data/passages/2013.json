Until the temperature rises to 60 degrees or above. All the plant will need is enough water to prevent wilting of the fronds. Too much water during a full rest period will most likely rot the root of your fern. Virtually all ferns can tolerate temperatures down to about 50 degrees. As the temperature falls, growth will slow down, and it will cease alltogether at 50 degrees, but without impairing the health of the plant.

However, hardy ferns in USDA zones 2 through 6, tend to be semi-evergreen. In most cases, it is safe to leave many hardy ferns outdoors all winter long. A few, however, are only cold-hardy to USDA zones 6 or 7. In that case, they are only safe outdoors in temperatures as low as 5 degrees below zero Fahrenheit for USDA zone 6, and zero degrees Fahrenheit for USDA zone 7.
