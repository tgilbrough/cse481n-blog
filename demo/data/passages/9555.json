(In some locations, you might not have the option of self-installation; Foxtel should advise you of this when you order.) Your existing plan pricing will remain. As ever, what you\u2019ll pay depends on what channels you\u2019ve signed up for, and whether you\u2019ve included additional options such as home broadband, phone calls, or non-cable services like Foxtel Play or Presto.
