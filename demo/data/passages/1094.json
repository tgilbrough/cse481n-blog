Oculomotor nerve palsy or third nerve palsy is an eye condition resulting from damage to the third cranial nerve or a branch thereof.

Cranial nerve palsy is a form of palsy involving one or more of the cranial nerves. Palsy occurs when a muscle becomes paralyzed or someone loses control of it, experiencing erratic muscle movements, spastic jerks, and other problems. In people with cranial palsy, control over a muscle or group of muscles is lost, leading to drooping, paralysis, or erratic involuntary movements. There are a number of reasons why someone might develop cranial nerve palsy. Facial or head trauma can be a cause, as this may directly damage a nerve. People can also experience this condition after a surgery in which a surgeon inadvertently damages one of the cranial nerve"}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/sixth-nerve-palsy", "passage_text": "Sixth nerve palsy is a disorder affecting the sixth nerve, which supplies the lateral rectus muscle.

The facial nerve-also called the 7th cranial nerve-travels through a narrow, bony canal (called the Fallopian canal) in the skull, beneath the ear, to the muscles on each side of the face. Bell's palsy occurs when the nerve that controls the facial muscles is swollen, inflamed, or compressed, resulting in facial weakness or paralysis.
