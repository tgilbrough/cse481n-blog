It is a departure from the forensic DNA of the CSI franchise and is darker as it focuses on cyber crime. Another CSI veteran, former CSI: NY showrunner Pam Veasey, is expected to run the new series."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI_(franchise)", "passage_text": "It was inspired by the work of cyber-psychologist Mary Aiken who is attached to the series as a producer. It features FBI agents assigned to the Cyber Crime Division at Quantico and is headlined by Patricia Arquette as Avery Ryan and, beginning in season two, CSI alum Ted Danson as D.B. Russell.

'CSI: Cyber': An Oscar Winner in the Worst 'CSI' Yet. You could feel sorry for Patricia Arquette, imagining that she signed on to CSI: Cyber before she won an Oscar for Boyhood \u2014 that now she\u2019s stuck on a risible CSI spinoff instead of scooping up fresh feature-film offers."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_theme_songs_for_all_CSI_shows", "passage_text": "The original CSI: Crime Scene Investigation series theme song is Who Are You performed by The Who.

Despite having two solid leads in Arquette and Van Der Beek, CSI: Cyber is only for the most hardcore of crime procedural fans -- or people who enjoy comically unrealistic UIs.
