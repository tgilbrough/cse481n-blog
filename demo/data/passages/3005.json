Protocols for computer networking all generally use packet switching techniques to send and receive messages in the form of packets. How Network Protocols Are Implemented. A group of network protocols that work together at higher and lower levels are often called a protocol family. Students of networking traditionally learn about the OSI model that conceptually organizes network protocol families into specific layers for teaching purposes."}, {"url": "https://www.edrawsoft.com/Network-Protocol.php", "passage_text": "Gigabit Ethernet. The most latest development in the Ethernet standard is a protocol that has a transmission speed of 1 Gbps. Gigabit Ethernet is primarily used for backbones on a network at this time. In the future, it will probably also be used for workstation and server connections. Ethernet. The Ethernet protocol is by far the most widely used one. Ethernet uses an access method called CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection). This is a system where each computer listens to the cable before sending anything through the network.

The OSI model, and any other network communication model, provides only a conceptual framework for communication between computers, but the model itself does not provide specific methods of communication. Actual communication is defined by various communication protocols. Ethernet. The Ethernet protocol is by far the most widely used one.

But some important and the commonly used network protocols are as follows. Ethernet: It is the first type of the networking protocol that is able to occupy the network widely. Local Talk: Another network protocol developed by the Apple for the sake of the development of the Macintosh computers. The main work of the local talk protocol is to establish the connection between the different computers and the serial port of the network.
