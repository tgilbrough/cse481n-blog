Molasses, from the Latin word melaceres, meaning honey-like, is a thick dark syrup that is a byproduct of sugar refining. It results when sugar is crystallized out of sugar cane or sugar beet juice. Molasses is sold both for human consumption, to be used in baking, and in the brewing of ale and distillation of rum, and as an ingredient in animal feed. In addition to molasses, which is itself a byproduct of the processing of sugar cane, there are several others materials that are used for other purposes.

The most common forms of molasses are made from either sugar cane or sugar beet juice which is boiled down to a syrup.

Blackstrap Molasses. 1  How it's made: Blackstrap is made from the third and final boiling of the molasses. 2  How it tastes: It is the thickest and darkest in color, and also the least sweet with a pronounced bitter flavor. 3  How to use it: Since it is bitter, only use blackstrap molasses if a recipe specifically calls for it."}, {"url": "http://www.thekitchn.com/a-guide-to-molasses-ingredient-intelligence-210864", "passage_text": "1 How it's made: Dark molasses comes from the second boiling of the cane or beet juice. 2  How it tastes: Thicker, less sweet, darker, and stronger in flavor than light molasses. 3  How to use it: It can generally be used in place of light molasses and is what gives gingerbread cookies their distinct color and flavor.
