There are about 20,000 species in this group. They are found many places and can be free living or parasitic. A parasite lives off of another living thing called a host and can be harmful. One of the best known flatworms is the tapeworm. The tapeworm can get into a person's digestive tract and grow to enormous lengths."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatworm", "passage_text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The flatworms, or Platyhelminthes, Plathelminthes, or platyhelminths (from the Greek \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd, platy, meaning flat and \u1f15\u03bb\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03c2 (root: \u1f11\u03bb\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8-), helminth- , meaning worm) are a phylum of relatively simple bilaterian, unsegmented, soft-bodied invertebrates. Hence, the traditional platyhelminth subgroup Turbellaria is now regarded as paraphyletic, since it excludes the wholly parasitic groups, although these are descended from one group of turbellarians. Over half of all known flatworm species are parasitic, and some do enormous harm to humans and their livestock. Schistosomiasis, caused by one genus of trematodes, is the second-most devastating of all human diseases caused by parasites, surpassed only by malaria"}, {"url": "http://dvbiology.org/biologyweb/bworm.htm", "passage_text": "Type of digestive system: Some worms are parasitic, meaning that they live on or in another organism.

Flatworms are acoelomate, which means they do not have a body cavity. Roundworms are psuedocoelomate, which means they have a body cavity between their mesoderm and endoderm layers. The flatworm Planaria and the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans are both lab organisms that are called worms. However, they are not closely related. Flatworms (phylum Platyhelminthes) and roundworms (phylum Nematoda) are both called worms, but there are many differences between these two types of organisms."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/gastrovascular-cavity-definition-lesson-quiz.html", "passage_text": "The gastrovascular cavity is a structure found in primitive animal phyla.
