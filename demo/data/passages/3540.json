At 20,000 miles per year with a vehicle that gets twenty miles to the gallon you would need 1,000 gallons of gas per year. With gas prices at $2.00 that would cost $2,000 per year. At $4.00 it would cost $4,000 per year. So over the last five years your gasoline bill has increased by $2,000 or $38.46 dollars per week."}]
