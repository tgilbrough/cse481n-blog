[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate", "passage_text": "Almost all inorganic nitrate salts are soluble in water at standard temperature and pressure. A common example of an inorganic nitrate salt is potassium nitrate (saltpeter). A rich source of inorganic nitrate in the human body comes from diets rich in leafy green foods, such as spinach and arugula. It is now believed that dietary nitrate in the form of plant-based foods is converted in the body to nitrite. While nitrate is much less toxic than ammonia, levels over 30 ppm of nitrate can inhibit growth, impair the immune system and cause stress in some aquatic species."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate", "passage_text": "Nitrites are produced by a number of species of nitrifying bacteria, and the nitrate compounds for gunpowder (see this topic for more) were historically produced, in the absence of mineral nitrate sources, by means of various fermentation processes using urine and dung.

It is made up of one nitrogen and three oxygen atoms. It is part of many important molecules. Potassium nitrate is a common nitrate, used in fertilizers because plants need nitrates to live and grow. Some nitrates are explosive. People make large amounts of nitrates from ammonia. Nitrates are similar to nitrites. Nitric acid has the formula HNO 3 and has no overall charge, because the hydrogen ion is positive"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate", "passage_text": "Nitrate is a polyatomic ion with the molecular formula NO 3 \u2212 and a molecular mass of 62.0049 g/mol.
