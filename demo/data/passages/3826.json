[{"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_dextrinization_and_its_examples", "passage_text": "Making the world better, one answer at a time. Dextrinization is the browning of starch goods when subjected to dry heat. On dry heating, the starch in the food goes through a chemical reaction. During this reaction, the starch molecules break down into dextrin (hence the name). Examples of dextrinization are toasting bread, and baking biscuits and cakes."}, {"url": "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dextrin", "passage_text": "Medical Definition of DEXTRIN. : any of various soluble gummy polysaccharides (C6H10O5)n obtained from starch by the action of heat, acids, or enzymes and used as adhesives, as sizes for paper and textiles, as thickening agents (as in syrups), and in beer. dex\u00b7trin also dex\u00b7trine \\-\u02ccstr\u0113n, -str\u0259n\\. dextrin. noun dex\u00b7trin \\\u02c8dek-str\u0259n\\"}, {"url": "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dextrinization", "passage_text": "Definition of DEXTRINIZATION. : an act or process of dextrinizing.

Dependent on the intended use of the starch, e.g. paper processing, binder for pigments, glue production, it has to be dextrinated in such a way that the structure fits the production process. After tests are completed succesfully, the dextrinization (step 3) can be implemented based on the following flow sheet. The native starch is mixed with the necessary additives and processed for a certain time and under defined conditions for maturing, so that an intensive mixing of starch and additives is guaranteed."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextrinisation", "passage_text": "It consists of two types of molecules: the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin. Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to 80% amylopectin by weight. Glycogen, the glucose store of animals, is a more branched version of amylopectin. The products of starch degradation are to the major part maltose and to a less extensive part glucose. These molecules are now exported from the plastid to the cytosol. Maltose is exported via the maltose transporter. If this transporter is mutated (MEX1-mutant), maltose accumulates in the plastid."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextrinisation", "passage_text": "Starch or amylum is a carbohydrate consisting of a large number of glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds.
