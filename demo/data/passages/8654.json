For most, a normal resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). For athletic individuals, a normal resting heart rate may be as low as 40 to 60 bpm. Abnormal heart rhythms can be described as a heart beating too fast (above 100 bpm) or slow (below 60 bpm), a fluttering sensation in the chest area or the skipping of a heart beat."}, {"url": "http://www.livescience.com/42081-normal-heart-rate.html", "passage_text": "Heart rate, also known as pulse, is the number of times a person's heart beats per minute.

Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. For example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats a minute. To measure your heart rate, simply check your pulse. Place your index and third fingers on your neck to the side of your windpipe. Consult your doctor if your resting heart rate is consistently above 100 beats a minute (tachycardia) or if you're not a trained athlete and your resting heart rate is below 60 beats a minute (bradycardia) \u2014 especially if you have other signs or symptoms, such as fainting, dizziness or shortness of breath.
