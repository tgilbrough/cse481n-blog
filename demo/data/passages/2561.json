This process is called translation. Certain cells of the pancreas and digestive tract produce a high volume of protein as enzymes.

Rough endoplasmic reticulum is a form of endoplasmic reticulum that is studded with ribosomes. Since it has ribosomes stuck all over it, it has a bumpy appearance and is therefore called rough endoplasmic reticulum. The membranes that make up the rough endoplasmic reticulum are composed of lipids just like the membrane that surrounds the entire cell itself. The surface of rough endoplasmic reticulum is dotted with other organelles known as ribosomes. Ribosomes are cellular organelles composed of two subunits that produce proteins."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_Rough_Endoplasmic_Reticulum", "passage_text": "Rough endoplasmic reticulum is a cell organelle that helps in protein synthesis as well as packaging of materials into lysosomes and secretory activities of cell.

There are two regions of the ER that differ in both structure and function. One region is called rough ER because it has ribosomes attached to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The other region is called smooth ER because it lacks attached ribosomes. Typically, the smooth ER is a tubule network and the rough ER is a series of flattened sacs. The space inside of the ER is called the lumen."}, {"url": "http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/endoplasmicreticulum/endoplasmicreticulum.html", "passage_text": "The surface of rough endoplasmic reticulum is covered with ribosomes, giving it a bumpy appearance when viewed through the microscope.
