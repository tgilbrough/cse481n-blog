Answer by Paul Jones. Confidence votes 68.5K. Rockhound. A drop in the elevation of the surface of the land is called land subsidence, and can be caused by a collapse of underground mining shafts or naturally occurring underground cave system collapses, commonly called sinkholes. "}, {"url": "http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/geol204/subsidence.htm", "passage_text": "Surface Subsidence and Collapse. Subsidence hazards involve either the sudden collapse of the ground to form a depression or the slow subsidence or compaction of the sediments near the Earth's surface. The exact place and time of a disaster related to subsidence cannot usually be predicted with any degree of certainty. This is true of both slow subsidence related to fluid withdrawal and sudden subsidence related to sinkhole formation or mine collapse."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_does_subsidence_occur", "passage_text": "Making the world better, one answer at a time. Subsidence occurs when one plate is denser than the plate it is moving into. It then slips under the less dense plate and melts into the mantle.

This requires uplift of the island of over 100 m (328 feet) within that short period of time. In addition, a shoreline landed upon by Captain Cook's surveying crew in 1779 is now 40 m (131 feet) above sea level. Normal activity for Yellowstone includes extensive seismicity, periods of uplift and subsidence of the caldera, and intermittent changes to hydrothermal features at the surface. There are usually over a thousand earthquakes per year at Yellowstone."}, {"url": "http://geoscience.wisc.edu/~chuck/Classes/Mtn_and_Plates/rock_deformation.html", "passage_text": "For low angle faults (10 degrees), uplift will occur at rates of about 1 mm/yr (1 kilometer per million years). Over 5 million years, this amounts to uplift of 5 kilometers or 3 miles (15,900 feet).
