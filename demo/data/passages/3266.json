To the best of my knowledge there\u2019s no way to find out who\u2019s been looking at your Facebook profile, Timeline and photos. There are tons of apps out there that claim to give you that information if you install them, but as far as I can tell they are all scams. I recommend that you steer clear of them. Q&A: How can I see who has been looking at my Facebook page? Question from Kelsey J.: I\u2019ve been looking around my Facebook trying to find a way to see who all has been scoping out my profile."}, {"url": "http://techforluddites.com/beware-of-who-viewed-my-profile-apps-on-facebook/", "passage_text": "However\u2026.

Of course, this isn't the same as seeing everyone that viewed your profile, but you can at least see everyone that viewed your message or group post. Since I hate this feature, I'm glad this hasn't leaked out to any other Facebook applications."}, {"url": "https://www.grahamcluley.com/2013/05/who-view-my-facebook-profile/", "passage_text": "And, of course, you might be keen to find out if that creepy guy in the lunch queue at work is cyber-stalking you. Bad news, I'm afraid. There is *no* way that you can find out who has been looking at your Facebook profile. The only people who might have the data is Facebook itself, and it doesn't seem interested in providing the functionality. So anything which claims to offer you a way to find out who has been peeking at your profile, is almost certainly a scam. Proceed with caution and be careful not to be duped into clicking on any links, or completing any surveys to get some magic Facebook power."}, {"url": "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/who%E2%80%99s-been-looking-at-your-facebook-page--can-you-find-out-.html", "passage_text": "Facebook. First the warning: there are s cams aplenty promising to show you who is stalking your Facebook page. I put in a call to Facebook and spoke with their technical folks-the truth is no-one can see who's been on your Facebook page. There are no features buried in the Facebook settings with that data. Facebook says it is one of the most common scam come-ons on the site. Don't fall for it; you cannot see who's looking at your profile (and no one can see if you've been looking at theirs)."}]
