It is crucial to get a detailed, written estimate of the timeline of your case, the number of hours of work involved, and the final cost you will be incurring. Before filing for divorce, couples who cannot agree on the terms of their separation may wish to seek the services of an attorney who can mediate and help craft an agreement."}, {"url": "http://info.legalzoom.com/average-cost-uncontested-divorce-20665.html", "passage_text": "Whether you handle your divorce yourself or hire an attorney, there will be extra costs. State courts charge a filing fee for a divorce petition, usually in the neighborhood of $200. If you use a sheriff or private process server to deliver your petition to your spouse, this will cost an additional $35 to $100. In most states, you can bypass this expense if you\u2019re on amicable terms with your spouse. The average cost is about $300. You can also hire an attorney by the hour to review your paperwork for you. This will cost less than a flat uncontested divorce rate, but would not require putting down a retainer fee. You\u2019re not retaining the attorney; you\u2019re purchasing his time by the hour, just for specific services."}, {"url": "http://www.3stepdivorce.com/states/florida.shtml", "passage_text": "Our 3StepDivorce Online Divorce for Florida is offered with a peace-of-mind 100% guarantee.
