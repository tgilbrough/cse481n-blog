It is part of the refractory metals group, which are widely used as minor components in alloys. The chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum. Tantalum is also used for medical implants and bone repair. Its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers. Tantalum, always together with the chemically similar niobium, occurs in the minerals tantalite, columbite and coltan (a mix of columbite and tantalite). Tantalum is a rare metal, comprising just 6991800000000000000\u26608\u00d710\u22129 % of the universe, making it fifteen times less abundant in the universe than gold (which makes up 6992600000000000000\u26606\u00d710\u22128 %)."}, {"url": "https://www.sparkfun.com/news/1271", "passage_text": "The tantalum capacitors is a special type of electrolytic capacitor. To make a tantalum capacitor, powdered tantalum is formed into a pellet through the sintering process. The pellet is submerged in an acidic solution and a DC voltage is applied, which creates an oxide layer over all the tantalum particles. The worst part is that they often fail short. If you are using tantalum capacitors for power supply decoupling and a voltage spike causes a tantalum \u201cevent,\u201d the power and ground lines are then shorted together, which could ruin even more circuitry."}, {"url": "http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/data/capacitor/tantalum-capacitor.php", "passage_text": "Tantalum SMD capacitors.
