The stapes /\u02c8ste\u026api\u02d0z/ is a bone in the middle ear of humans and other mammals which is involved in the conduction of sound vibrations to the inner ear. The stirrup-shaped small bone is on and transmits these to the oval window, medially. Situated between the incus and the inner ear, the stapes transmits sound vibrations from the incus to the oval window, a membrane-covered opening to the inner ear. The stapes is also stabilized by the stapedius muscle, which is innervated by the facial nerve"}, {"url": "http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Middle%20Ear", "passage_text": "Middle Ear refers to the space between the eardrum and the inner ear, where three tiny bones (also known as ossicles) are located and named based on their shapes: the malleus, meaning hammer, the incus or anvil and the stapes or stirrup.
