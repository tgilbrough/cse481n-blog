Instead of flapping the wings, they use specialised gliding techniques to minimise the use of muscles and energy."}, {"url": "http://www.ourendangeredworld.com/species/birds-bats/amsterdam-albatross/", "passage_text": "Once thought to be a subspecies of the wandering albatross, DNA testing has proven that the Amsterdam albatross is, indeed, a separate species.

The great albatrosses have wingspans which can reach 3.7 m (12 feet). Albatrosses mostly nest on remote ocean islands and it is not uncommon for a number of species to nest together. Of the 21 species of albatrosses, 19 are listed as threatened with extinction."}, {"url": "http://www.bagheera.com/inthewild/van_albatros.htm", "passage_text": "Historically, the short-tailed albatross bred on a number of Japanese islands, and its range extended to most of the north Pacific Ocean. In the 19th century, the short-tailed albatross was common in the north Pacific.

Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. Albatrosses are endangered due to the high rate of by-catch (accidental catch by commercial fishermen) particularly with longline fishing gear in which by-catch rates can be as high as 1 bird per 10 hooks."}, {"url": "http://www.brighthub.com/environment/science-environmental/articles/24849.aspx", "passage_text": "As of 2009, 19 of the 22 species are officially recognized as either vulnerable, nearly threatened or critically endangered.
