Although a Breathalyzer test can estimate a person's BAC, to determine actual blood alcohol content, a blood sample must be used. A blood sample for alcohol content is taken in the same way as any other blood sample, using a needle. The needle is placed into a vein and a collection tube is inserted into the back of the needle. The needle is withdrawn, and the collection tube is sent to a lab for testing."}, {"url": "http://www.lawqa.com/qa/how-long-will-it-take-to-get-my-blood-alcohol-results-back", "passage_text": "If they are just testing the blood for alcohol, it could be back in a couple of weeks.
