The synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, in contrast to the degradation (oxidation), which occurs in the mitochondria. Lipogenesis is the process by which acetyl-CoA is converted to fatty acids. The former is an intermediate stage in metabolism of simple sugars, such as glucose, a source of energy of living organisms. Through lipogenesis and subsequent triglyceride synthesis, the energy can be efficiently stored in the form of fats. Lipogenesis encompasses both the process of fatty acid synthesis and triglyceride synthesis (where fatty acids are esterified with glycerol to form fats)"}, {"url": "http://www.med.unc.edu/neurology/files/documents/child-teaching-pdf/OVERVIEW%20OF%20LIPID%20METABOLISM.pdf", "passage_text": "Fatty acids are released from adipose tissue \u2022 Mass action drives \u03b2 -oxidation in the liver.

"}, {"url": "http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/lipid-synthesis.php", "passage_text": "The synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA is carried out by fatty acid synthase, FAS. Fatty acid synthase is encoded by the FASN gene which is located on chromosome 17q25 and is composed of 43 exons that encode a protein of 2511 amino acids. The intracellular levels of malonyl-CoA represent a balance between its synthesis from acetyl-CoA by ACC and its utilization in fatty acid synthesis by FAS as well as by its degradation to acetyl-CoA via the action of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_metabolism", "passage_text": "One role of fatty acids within animal metabolism is energy production in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. When compared to other macronutrient classes (carbohydrates and protein), fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis by a pathway called \u03b2-oxidation. In addition, fatty acids are important for energy storage, phospholipid membrane formation, and signaling pathways. Since the hydrocarbon portion of fatty acids is hydrophobic, these molecules can be stored in a relatively anhydrous (water-free) environment. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are more highly hydrated. For example, 1 g of glycogen can bind approximately 2 g of water, which translates to 1.33 kcal/g (4 kcal/3 g)."}, {"url": "http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/lipid-synthesis.php", "passage_text": "The pathway for fatty acid synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm, whereas, oxidation occurs in the mitochondria. The other major difference is the use of nucleotide co-factors. Oxidation of fats involves the reduction of FADH + and NAD + . Synthesis of fats involves the oxidation of NADPH.
