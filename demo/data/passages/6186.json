Hydrogen peroxide is a mild antiseptic used on the skin to prevent infection of minor cuts, scrapes, and burns. It may also be used as a mouth rinse to help remove mucus or to relieve minor mouth irritation (e.g., due to canker/ cold sores, gingivitis)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide", "passage_text": "Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest peroxide (a compound with an oxygen-oxygen single bond) and finds use as a strong oxidizer, bleaching agent and disinfectant. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide, or ' high-test peroxide ,' is a reactive oxygen species and has been used as a propellant in rocketry."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-76035/hydrogen-peroxide/details", "passage_text": "Hydrogen peroxide is a mild antiseptic used on the skin to prevent infection of minor cuts, scrapes, and burns.
