On the bottom of the chip are hundreds of connector pins that plug into each of the corresponding holes in the socket. Tip: The CPU is often referred to as the brain of the computer. However, it is more appropriate to refer to software as the brain and the CPU as a very efficient calculator. Note: Many new computer users may improperly call their computer and sometimes their monitor the CPU."}, {"url": "http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CPU.html", "passage_text": "CPU (pronounced as separate letters) is the abbreviation for central processing unit. Sometimes referred to simply as the central processor, but more commonly called processor, the CPU is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place. In terms of computing power, the CPU is the most important element of a computer system. On personal computers and small workstations, the CPU is housed in a single chip called a microprocessor. Since the 1970's the microprocessor class of CPUs has almost completely overtaken all other CPU implementations. The CPU itself is an internal component of the computer."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/central-processing-unit-cpu-parts-definition-function.html", "passage_text": "The central processing unit (CPU) is the brain of your computer. It handles all the instructions you give your computer, and the faster it does this, the better. Learn about how a CPU processes instructions and how computer engineers are continuously coming up with ways to make it go faster. In summary, a CPU is the brain of a computer, processing all the instructions you give it. A CPU has various components to receive the instructions, process them, and then transform them into signals to activate other parts of the computer."}, {"url": "http://www.newegg.com/CPUs-Processors/Category/ID-34", "passage_text": "CPUs/Processors.
