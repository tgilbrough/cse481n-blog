A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an organism whose genetic [material] has been altered using techniques in genetics generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA technology is the ability to combine DNA molecules from different sources into the one molecule in a test tube. Thus, the abilities or the phenotype of the organism, or the proteins it produces, can be modified through the modification of its genes.

Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences.

Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3' . This requires first making a duplicate copy of every gene in the genome in a process called DNA replication. The copies are made by specialized enzymes known as DNA polymerases, which read one strand of the double-helical DNA, known as the template strand, and synthesize a new complementary strand."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "passage_text": "The total complement of genes in an organism or cell is known as its genome, which may be stored on one or more chromosomes. A chromosome consists of a single, very long DNA helix on which thousands of genes are encoded. The region of the chromosome at which a particular gene is located is called its locus.

Many traits are determined by the function of more than one gene. For example, a person's height is likely to be determined by genes affecting growth, appetite, muscle mass, and activity level. Every human cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. A trait is any gene-determined characteristic and is often determined by more than one gene. Some traits are caused by abnormal genes that are inherited or that are the result of a new mutation.

Every gene in the DNA codes for one protein. The unique order of the base pairs in each gene specifies the sequence of amino acids in the long string of amino acids from which the corresponding protein is made. The DNA, however, does not code for the protein directly. It uses an intermediate called RNA. Genes contain the blueprints for life. All living organisms contain genes. The traits of a human being, for example, are based on the expression of approximately 80,000 different genes.

DNA (or deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that carries the genetic information in all cellular forms of life and some viruses. It belongs to a class of molecules called the nucleic acids, which are polynucleotides-that is, long chains of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of three components: The nucleus of each cell in our bodies contains approximately 1.8 metres of DNA in total, although each strand is less than one millionth of a centimetre thick.
