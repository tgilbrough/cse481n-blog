Traditionally, most audits take place within two years of filing. For example, if you get an audit notice in 2014, it will most likely be for a tax return submitted in 2012 or 2013. The IRS reserves the right to go back as far as six years and audit a return, particularly if the agency has reason to believe a significant error has taken place. If you receive a notice of an audit, comply with the request as soon as possible by providing necessary materials to answer the audit\u2019s inquiry.
