A meat or instant-read thermometer is your best bet for determining the temperature of your chicken, and if you're cooking a whole bird, it should be inserted into the thickest part of the thigh but not touching bone."}, {"url": "http://ochef.com/1053.htm", "passage_text": "If you handle chicken properly, but cook it to a lower temperature, you may be exposing yourself to a very slight risk of food poisoning, but eating consistently tasty chicken. We try never to roast a chicken beyond 160\u00b0F in the breast, but that s our choice."}, {"url": "http://ochef.com/1053.htm", "passage_text": "This goes to the very heart of the liberal/conservative debate  and, as you can imagine, it s not pretty. Our government says that you should cook a whole chicken until the temperature measured in the thigh is 180\u00b0F (82\u00b0C). If you cook chicken pieces, the government says, the thigh, wings, and drumsticks should be 180\u00b0F, while the breast should reach 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C)."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_should_the_temperature_of_cooked_chicken_be", "passage_text": "Very generally, you would let them cook for 45 minutes to an hour at 350 degrees F.

The time your chicken will bake in the oven does depend on the internal temperature and the size of your chicken or chicken pieces. Generally I bake chicken at 350 degrees F. for 30 to 40 minutes."}, {"url": "http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/ChickenCook.htm", "passage_text": "A cooking or meat thermometer should not be a sometime thing.. Use it every time you prepare foods like poultry, roasts, hams, casseroles, meat loaves and egg dishes.
