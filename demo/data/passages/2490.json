All life forms engage in semiosis, all use signs, only humans know they exist. Only humans engage in inquiry into semiosis, or sign activity. In fact, most semiosis is chemical (Sebeok, 1991). This makes Saussure's semiology a subdivision of semiotics, the study of that type of semiosis that is species-specifically human. A sign is not that which it represents; it only resembles, refers to, or is somehow associated with that which it represents."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-semiotics-definition-examples.html", "passage_text": "This question of meaning is at the heart of semiotics. Semiotics is the study of sign systems. It explores how words and other signs make meaning. In semiotics, a sign is anything that stands in for something other than itself. Lesson Summary. Semiotics is the study of signs. In language, signs are part of the existing structure that we use to communicate. That structure is called la langue. Each sign is made up of the signifier (the word) and the signified (the concept)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics", "passage_text": "Semiotics (also called semiotic studies; not to be confused with the Saussurean tradition called semiology which is a part of semiotics) is the study of meaning-making, the study of sign processes and meaningful communication.

It includes the study of how meaning is constructed and understood. Semioticians also sometimes examine how organisms make predictions about and adapt to their semiotic niche in the world (see semiosis). Semiotics is a method to study the use of symbols in language. Every symbol (words, pictures, etc) contains several meanings.
