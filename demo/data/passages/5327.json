There is no cure for coeliac disease, but switching to a gluten-free diet should help control symptoms and prevent the long-term consequences of the disease.

Gluten is part of certain foods-mainly foods made from wheat, barley and rye. Various symptoms can develop including tummy (abdominal) pains, tiredness and weight loss. The cause is a sensitivity to gluten. Gluten occurs in common foods including wheat, barley and rye, and any foods made from these such as bread, pasta and biscuits.

A first degree relative (parent, sibling, child) of someone with coeliac disease has about a 10% chance of also having the disease.

Celiac disease is a digestive disease that damages the small intestine and interferes with absorption of nutrients from food. People who have celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, and barley. Gluten is found mainly in foods but may also be found in everyday products such as medicines, vitamins, and lip balms. When people with celiac disease eat foods or use products containing gluten, their immune system responds by damaging or destroying villi\u2014the tiny, fingerlike protrusions lining the small intestine. Villi normally allow nutrients from food to be absorbed through the walls of the small intestine into the bloodstream."}, {"url": "http://www.celiac.com/", "passage_text": "Celiac disease, also known as gluten intolerance, is a genetic disorder that affects at least 1 in 133 Americans.
