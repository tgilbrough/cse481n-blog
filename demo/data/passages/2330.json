Articular cartilage resists wear quite well, but time and wear can eventually take their toll. When the joint surface extensively breaks down, the condition is known as degenerative arthritis or osteoarthrosis (OA). 1 An MRI with injected joint contrast is the best study to visualize these defects. 2  Chondromalacia (localized wear and tear) Softening or fissuring of the articular cartilage usually a consequence of cumulative injury or degenerative joint disease."}, {"url": "http://www.porcpotlas.hu/en/porchiany.html", "passage_text": "Focal defect of the cartilage. Defect of the articular cartilage due to any inflammation, injury or trauma causing partial or full thickness cartilage defect in a well defined focal area.

The successful treatment of focal full-thickness articular defects of the knee has continued to present a formidable challenge, and no traditional treatment method has provided consistent acceptable, long-term clinical results. Although the etiology of full-thickness chondral defects in the knee is not well-defined and the clinical course is unpredictable, it appears that articular cartilage lesions (ACL) are often associated with pain and limited mobility followed by degenerative changes typical of osteoarthritis."}, {"url": "http://www.howardluksmd.com/education/common-injuries/cartilage-defects/", "passage_text": "Types of Cartilage: In the human knee there are two forms of cartilage.
