Some adaptations are structural. Structural adaptations are physical features of an organism like the bill on a bird or the fur on a bear. Other adaptations are behavioral. Behavioral adaptations are the things organisms do to survive. For example, bird calls and migration are behavioral adaptations. Adaptations are the result of evolution. Evolution is a change in a species over long periods of time. "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_adaptation", "passage_text": "Neural adaptation or sensory adaptation is a change over time in the responsiveness of the sensory system to a constant stimulus. It is usually experienced as a change in the stimulus. For example, if one rests one's hand on a table, one immediately feels the table's surface on one's skin. Adaptation is considered to be the cause of perceptual phenomena like afterimages and the motion aftereffect. In the absence of fixational eye movements, visual perception may fade out or disappear due to neural adaptation. (See Adaptation (eye))."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Why_does_adaptation_occur", "passage_text": "Making the world better, one answer at a time.
