Pure silicon is a dark gray solid with the same crystalline structure as diamond. Its chemical and physical properties are similar to this material. Silicon has a melting point of 2570\u00b0 F (1410\u00b0 C), a boiling point of 4271\u00b0 F (2355\u00b0 C), and a density of 2.33 g/cm3. Source(s): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon.

Thank you. :}. 1 person found this useful. Melting temperature is the point where a substance is reduced to a liquid (this is the state it changes to). the usual melting point of substances is 100 degrees or higher."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon", "passage_text": "Silicon is a solid at room temperature, with relatively high melting and boiling points of 1414 and 3265 \u00b0C, respectively. Like water, it has a greater density in a liquid state than in a solid state, and so, like water but unlike most substances, it does not contract when it freezes, but expands. Measured by mass, silicon makes up 27.7% of the Earth's crust and is the second most abundant element in the crust, with only oxygen having a greater abundance. Silicon is usually found in the form of complex silicate minerals, and less often as silicon dioxide (silica, a major component of common sand)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone_rubber", "passage_text": "Silicone rubber is an elastomer (rubber-like material) composed of silicone \u2014itself a polymer \u2014containing silicon together with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Silicone rubbers are widely used in industry, and there are multiple formulations. Silicone rubbers are often one-or two-part polymers, and may contain fillers to improve properties or reduce cost. Silicone rubber is generally non-reactive, stable, and resistant to extreme environments and temperatures from -55 \u00b0C to +300 \u00b0C while still maintaining its useful properties."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon", "passage_text": "Silicon is a chemical element with symbol Si and atomic number 14. It is a tetravalent metalloid, more reactive than germanium, the metalloid directly below it in the table. Controversy about silicon's character dates to its discovery; it was first prepared and characterized in pure form in 1823.
