Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter conditions across eastern North America and drier conditions in the tropics. When air turbulence occurs, water droplets collide, producing larger droplets. As these larger water droplets descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain."}, {"url": "http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/rain/why-does-it-rain", "passage_text": "There are three different ways of turning moist air into cloud, so that it rains or snows. Rain-and other forms of precipitation-occur when warm moist air cools and condensation occurs. Since warm air can hold more water than cool air, when the warmer air is cooled the moisture condenses to liquid-and it rains. The video and text below explain how rain forms and the different types of rain that we get in the UK. Frontal rain occurs when two air masses meet. When a warm air mass meets a cold air mass, they don't mix as they have different densities (a bit like oil and water)."}, {"url": "http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/cld/prcp/home.rxml", "passage_text": "SectionsLatest Update: 07/21/97 Rain and Hail Atmospheric conditions that lead to the development of rain and hail.

The most common causes of hypothermia are exposure to cold-weather conditions or cold water. But prolonged exposure to any environment colder than your body can lead to hypothermia if you aren't dressed appropriately or can't control the conditions. Specific conditions leading to hypothermia include: 1  Wearing clothes that aren't warm enough for weather conditions. 2  Staying out in the cold too long."}, {"url": "http://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercycleprecipitation.html", "passage_text": "Water cycle for kids poster.

Low pressure leads to unstable air conditions. When the ground is heated, the air will rise and keep rising. Eventually, the rising air will cool enough to produce condensation (cloud and rain). When the atmosphere is at high pressure, the rising air bubble is always cooler than the surrounding air. When the ground is heated, the air will not rise. If air does not rise, rain cannot condense. Convection rain requires a warm ground and low pressure. It causes short showers interspaced with sunny periods."}, {"url": "http://www.krysstal.com/rain.html", "passage_text": "High pressure leads to stable air conditions.
