At 90 days, 95% will be positive. At 6 months, 99% will be positive. Initial testing for HIV is designed to detect antibodies to the virus. More than 98% of people who have HIV will produce enough antibodies to HIV to be detected on tests within 3 months of the time they got infected. In very rare cases, it could take up to 6 months for someone to test"}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/hiv-aids-screening", "passage_text": "These blood tests check for HIV antibodies. Your body makes antibodies in response to the HIV infection. These tests can't detect HIV in the blood soon after infection because it takes time for your body to make these antibodies. It generally takes two to 8 weeks for your body to produce antibodies, but in some cases it can take up to six months. Newer tests can detect the presence of HIV antigen, a protein, up to 20 days earlier than standard tests. This helps prevent spread of the virus to others and means an earlier start for treatment. It is done with a pinprick to the finger."}, {"url": "http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/testing.html", "passage_text": "These antigen/antibody combination tests can find HIV as soon as 3 weeks after exposure to the virus, but they are only available for testing blood, not oral fluid.

There are different types of HIV Tests, and each type has a different window period. We have a more in depth article about HIV test window periods. A test taken at least 12 weeks (3 months) after exposure to the virus provides highly accurate results. In rare cases, a person could take up to six months to test positive using standard tests, and that is almost always a person with a severely compromised immune system due to another disease, such as leukemia.

The body responds to HIV infection by producing antibodies, which are detectable within a few weeks after the initial infection in most people. After 90 days, about 90% of those with HIV infection will develop a positive HIV test.

In more than 97% of people, this period lasts between 2 and 12 weeks. In a very small number of people, the process takes up to 6 months. A good strategy would be to go back for a test 3 months after your possible exposure; the result you get after 3 months will be 99% certain. However, if you think you may have been exposed to HIV and are having symptoms of HIV infection, see a provider right away."}]
