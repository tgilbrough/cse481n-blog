It lays out the many problem areas for moisture in your mobile home and some solutions to these issues. As I was saying, moisture can be a big issue for mobile homes. We tend to suffer with pretty poor insulation. Many states and the federal government developed new building standards for manufactured housing in the late 90\u2019s.

Look under the mobile home to see if the home is set-up on a concrete slab or on solid ground. If the home is not on a concrete slab, apply a thick plastic sheet to the ground under the mobile home. Using either blocks or rocks, weight the plastic down to prevent transfer of moisture from the earth into the mobile home.
