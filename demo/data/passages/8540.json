The surface can hold up a weight, and the surface of a water droplet holds the droplet together, in a ball shape. Some small things can float on a surface because of surface tension, even though they normally couldn't float. Surface tension has the dimension of force per unit length, or of energy per unit area. The two are equivalent\u2014but when referring to energy per unit of area, people use the term surface energy \u2014which is a more general term in the sense that it applies also to solids and not just liquids."}, {"url": "http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/Lesson-2/Types-of-Forces", "passage_text": "Tension Force Ftens. Return to Top. The tension force is the force that is transmitted through a string, rope, cable or wire when it is pulled tight by forces acting from opposite ends. The tension force is directed along the length of the wire and pulls equally on the objects on the opposite ends of the wire.

The cohesive forces between liquid molecules are responsible for the phenomenon known as surface tension. Surface Tension and Droplets: Surface tension is responsible for the shape of liquid droplets. Although easily deformed, droplets of water tend to be pulled into a spherical shape by the cohesive forces of the surface layer."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_tension", "passage_text": "in physics tension is a force.the pull at both ends of a stretched spring,string or rope is called tension.

Tension is the opposite of compression. In physics, although tension is not a force, it does have the units of force and can be measured in newtons (or sometimes pounds-force). The system has a constant velocity and is therefore in equilibrium because the tension in the string (which is pulling up on the object) is equal to the force of gravity, mg, which is pulling down on the object."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)", "passage_text": "In physics, tension describes the pulling force exerted by each end of a string, cable, chain, or similar one-dimensional continuous object, or by each end of a rod, truss member, or similar three dimensional object.
