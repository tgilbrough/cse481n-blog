Orthodox Jews often use the Yiddish word shul (pronounced shool) to refer to their synagogue. In the USA, synagogues are often called temples. Traditional Jewish worship requires a minyan (a quorum of ten adult males) to take place. In an Orthodox synagogue the service will be conducted in ancient Hebrew, and the singing will be unaccompanied.
