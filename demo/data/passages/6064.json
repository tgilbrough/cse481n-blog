Scleral contact lenses are a specialized type of contact lens used for managing a variety of eye conditions. They are large, and typically their diameter is 18-20mm. This is twice the size of a standard gas permeable contact lens and larger than a typical soft contact lens. Scleral contact lenses are custom made for each eye. They are designed so the lens rests on the less sensitive white sclera, and vaults over the cornea."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleral_lens", "passage_text": "A scleral lens, also known as a scleral contact lens, is a large contact lens that rests on the sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea. Scleral lenses are designed to treat a variety of eye conditions, many of which do not respond to other forms of treatment. A scleral lens is a prototypical lens dating back to the early 1880s. Originally these lenses were designed by using a substance to take a mold of the eye. Lenses would then be shaped to conform to the mold, initially using blown glass and then ground glass in the 1920s and polymethyl methacrylate in the 1940s."}, {"url": "http://www.allaboutvision.com/contacts/scleral-lenses.htm", "passage_text": "For these and other reasons, scleral contact lenses can cost significantly more than standard contacts; in fact, it is not uncommon for scleral contacts to cost three or four times more. While not typical, in cases when a complex, highly customized scleral lens is required, cost can be as high as $4,000 per eye or more. Most insurance programs do not automatically cover the full cost of scleral contact lenses. In some cases, vision insurance may reduce the cost of your lenses and/or fitting fee. In comparison, most conventional GP contact lenses are 9.0 to 9.5 mm in diameter and cover only 75 to 80 percent of the cornea.

Once they have had the opportunity to try on a lens, feel the comfort, and see the vision, the price of the lens becomes secondary. Right now, scleral lenses are a niche lens for a small population of patients, but that is up to us as practitioners to make them more of a mainstream option.
