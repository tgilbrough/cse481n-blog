For example, the reported normal flexion of the lumbar spine may vary between 80\u00b0 and 100\u00b0. The value cited below is 90\u00b0, but 80\u00b0 flexion should not interpreted as abnormal. The range of \u201cnormal\u201d motion also decreases with age, particularly in the spine.

OBJECTIVE: To generate normal values for active range of motion (ACROM) of the cervical spine in asymptomatic persons. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is a lack of normal values for ACROM based on large groups and stratified for different age categories. METHODS: Four hundred asymptomatic persons were included, 100 for each decade of age from 20 years to 60 years and in each subgroup 50 males and 50 females. ACROM was measured with the cervical range of motion (CROM) device. Analysis of variance and the Scheffe scheff\u00e9 post hoc test was used to investigate the differences OF acrom between the decades of.
