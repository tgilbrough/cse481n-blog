The direction of the electric current in the diode may be reversed. However, even if it is, the flow will still be one directional. A diode contains two electrodes that act in much the same manner as semiconductors. The positive or p-type is usually the anode and the negative or n-type is the cathode. In other words, the cathode is negatively charged as compared to the anode."}, {"url": "http://www.engineersgarage.com/tutorials/diodes", "passage_text": "A Diode is the simplest two-terminal unilateral semiconductor device. It allows current to flow only in one direction and blocks the current that flows in the opposite direction. The two terminals of the diode are called as anode and cathode.
