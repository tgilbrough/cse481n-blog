The first actual trilobites fossils found are from the Cambrian. Based on the variety of Early Cambrian fossils and the wide distribution, trilobites probably evolved sometime in the Pre-Cambrian. Once Trilobites made their appearance, they dominated the Paleozoic seas, many new orders and families quickly appeared.

Their fossil record extends back 530 million years to the early part of the Cambrian Period and indicates that trilobites evolved rapidly in the shallow seas of this time. In fact, trilobite fossils are so common in Cambrian rocks that the Cambrian Period is sometimes called the age of trilobites. Elrathia kingi is a common trilobite that lived during the Middle Cambrian Period. Human fascination with trilobites apparently has a long history.

Because they appeared quickly in geological time, and moulted like other arthropods, trilobites serve as excellent index fossils, enabling geologists to date the age of the rocks in which they are found. Trilobites finally disappeared in the mass extinction at the end of the Permian about 250 million years ago. The trilobites were among the most successful of all early animals, roaming the oceans for over 270 million years."}, {"url": "http://www.uky.edu/KGS/fossils/trilobites.htm", "passage_text": "Trilobite fossils have been found in Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Mississippian, and Pennsylvanian rocks in Kentucky, but are perhaps most commonly found in the Ordovician and Silurian rocks.
