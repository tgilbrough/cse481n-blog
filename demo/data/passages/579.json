The majority of the Northwestern Coniferous Forest is found in the temperate climate zone. Because of this biome's climate zone, abundant amounts of rainfall, and lush vegetation, this biome is also known as a temperate rainforest. Temperatures can get very cold in the winter, and fairly warm in the summer. Average yearly temperatures range from 14\u00b0 F, to 60\u00b0F. Moist oxygen coming from the Pacific ocean provides large amounts of rainfall to the Northwestern Coniferous Forest. The majority of this biome's precipitation comes in the spring, fall, and winter.

Precipitation in coniferous forests varies from 300 to 900 mm annually, with some temperate coniferous forests receiving up to 2,000 mm. The amount of precipitation depends on the forest location. In the northern boreal forests, the winters are long, cold and dry, while the short summers are moderately warm and moist. In the lower latitudes, precipitation is more evenly distributed throughout the year.

This biome can also be as low as -76\u00b0F. In the summer, the temperature can reach as high as 104\u00b0F. Fall is the shortest season and spring brings flowers and animals that wake up from hibernation. But when summertime finally comes around, the forest can get up to 20 hours of sunlight. Summer rain gives the forest an average of 10-20 inches of rain per year, and in winter snow is always on the ground."}, {"url": "http://cforest.weebly.com/climateannual-graphs.html", "passage_text": "During wintertime, the forest may only get a few key hours of sunlight.
