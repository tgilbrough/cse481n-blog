The symbol for square meter is m 2. Less formally, square meter is sometimes abbreviated sq m. When calculating area, it is important to realize that area is proportional to the square of the linear dimension."}, {"url": "http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/ampere-per-meter-squared-A-m-2", "passage_text": "The ampere per meter squared is a small unit of current density. Suppose a wire has a cross-sectional area of one millimeter squared (1 mm 2). This is 0.000001 meter squared (10 -6 m 2). If the current density in this wire is 1 A/m 2, then the wire carries 10 -6 A, or one microampere (1 \u00b5A), a tiny current."}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_metre", "passage_text": "The square metre (also spelled square meter, see spelling differences) is the SI derived unit of area, with symbol m\u00b2(33A1 in Unicode). It is defined as the area of a square whose sides measure exactly one metre."}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_metre", "passage_text": "For example, a kilometre is one thousand times the length of a metre, but a square kilometre is one million times the area of a square metre. A square metre is not the same as a metre square, an area 2 metres wide by 5 metres long would be 10 square metres. In contrast, a 10-metre square (10 metres by 10 metres) is actually 10"}, {"url": "http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/square-meter-meter-squared", "passage_text": "When converting between square meters and non-SI units of area such as square inches (sq in) or square miles (sq mi), the linear-unit conversion factor must be squared. For example, one meter is approximately 39.37 inches (39.37 in); therefore 1 m 2 = 39.37 2 = 1550 sq in (approximately)."}]
