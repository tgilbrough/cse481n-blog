Assertions are non-linguistic abstractions from sentences and can be evaluated as either true or false. The nature of propositions is highly controversial amongst philosophers, many of whom are skeptical about the existence of propositions.

In this sense, propositions are statements that are either true or false. This conception of a proposition was supported by the philosophical school of logical positivism.
