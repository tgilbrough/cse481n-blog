The best way to find a hummer nest is to wait for the female to lead you to it. This may not work, however, since the nest can be up to 1.5km or more from a good feeding area. Among Ruby-throated Hummingbirds, nests may be in hardwoods or evergreens from about one to 20 meters (three to 60 feet) from the ground."}, {"url": "http://hummingbirdmarket.com/hummingbird_articles/raising_baby_hummingbirds.html", "passage_text": "Incubation begins as soon as the eggs are laid.

Incubation lasts about 14-16 days--perhaps as long as 21 days in cool weather--during which time the female Ruby-throated Hummingbird is on the nest for about 50-55 minutes out of each hour. When the chicks hatch, they are about 2cm long, altricial (naked), and with very short bills. After spending the winter months in Mexico or Central America, male Ruby-throated Hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) typically arrive in the United States and Canada beginning in late March--earlier along the Gulf Coast, later in New England and Canada."}, {"url": "http://www.wildbirdsonline.com/a_raisingbabyhbirds2.htm", "passage_text": "Part 2.

The incubation period for hummingbird last usually between 16-18 days, but it can last as long as three weeks if the weather at the time is cooler then usual. The female hummingbird tries to maintain the temperature of the nest at about 96 degrees. So in general, the gestation period of hummingbird eggs is between two and three weeks, depending on the circumstances which are happening at the time.

In general, the minimal incubation period is from 14 to 17 days, but may be prolonged by inclement weather or harsh nesting conditions. The Andean Hillstar takes 20 to 23 days to incubate its eggs. Incubation of eggs In many cases, the female begins to incubate her eggs as soon as the first one is laid. Usually the eggs are laid in the morning, about 48 hours apart. However, this can vary from 24 to 72 hours.
