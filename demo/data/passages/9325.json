A compound forms whenever two or more atoms form chemical bonds with each other. The chemical formula for water is H 2 O, which means each molecule of water consists of one oxygen atom chemically bonded to two hydrogen atoms. Thus, water is a compound. It's also a molecule, which is any chemical species formed by two or more atoms chemically bonded to each other. The terms molecule and compound mean the same thing and can be used interchangeably"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound", "passage_text": "A chemical element bonded to an identical chemical element is not a chemical compound since only one element, not two different elements, is involved. Examples are the diatomic molecule hydrogen (H 2) and the polyatomic molecule sulfur (S 8). For example, the molecule of the compound water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen in a ratio of 2:1.water. In addition, compounds have a definite set of properties, and the elements that comprise a compound do not retain their original properties."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Is_water_a_compound", "passage_text": "Water is H2O so it is made of 2 different elements-Hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is made out of two atoms hence the subscript number 2. Yes, it has molecules consisting of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.

A compound is what you get when atoms of two or more different elements join together. All compounds are molecules, but not all molecules are compounds. Water is a molecule because it is made from atoms that have been chemically combined. It is also a compound because the atoms that make water are not all the same-some are oxygen and some are hydrogen. Oxygen in the atmosphere is a molecule because it is made from two atoms of oxygen. It is not a compound because it is made from atoms of only one element-oxygen.

If you apply this defintion, water is a pure compound, not a mixture. Report Abuse. Water is a mixture because it is made up of molecules that are composed of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. An atom is the smallest particle of a pure substance (element) that has all the properties of that substance. A molecule is made up of a number of atoms bonded together"}]
