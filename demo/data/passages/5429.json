This type of isomerism is most identifiable in secondary and tertiary alcohol isomers. Tautomers are structural isomers of the same chemical substance that spontaneously interconvert with each other, even when pure. They have different chemical properties and, as a consequence, distinct reactions characteristic to each form are observed. The different types of isomers, including position isomers 2-fluoropropane and 1-fluoropropane on the left. In structural isomers, sometimes referred to as constitutional isomers, the atoms and functional groups are joined together in different ways.
