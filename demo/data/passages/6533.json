The cost of a PV system depends on the system size, equipment options (panels and inverters), permitting costs, and labor costs. Prices vary depending on other factors as well, such as whether your home is new, where the system is installed on your premise, the PV manufacturer, and other factors. For example, using the Clean Power Estimator, a south-facing three-kilowatt system installed at a 30-degree angle on a single-family home with a utility bill of $180 per month in San Francisco would cost a customer an estimated $19,282 with a payback period of 12 years."}, {"url": "http://www.gosolarcalifornia.ca.gov/solar_basics/pricing_financing.php", "passage_text": "That translates to about $34,800 for a four-kilowatt system, the average size of a residential installation.
