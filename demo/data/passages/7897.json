In this food chain the carnivore (Secondary consumer; Cheetah) is chasing the herbivores (Primary consumer; Zebra) and will probably kill one of the herbivores.

A cheetah chases down and devours a zebra. The scene is not uncommon in Etosha, where the cycle of life, death, and birth has played out longer than any human can remember. In this situation, the cheetah is the predator, the animal that is eating, while the zebra is the prey, the animal being eaten. Predators and prey comprise only a portion of what is commonly known as a food chain. A food chain explains how food energy is transferred between living things in an environment."}, {"url": "http://www.gotpetsonline.com/cheetah/cheetah-information/cheetah-food-chain.html", "passage_text": "This mane disappears as they get older The cheetah food chain needs to be explained by someone educated in that field; conservation efforts are strong because they're endangered; find photos on pet websites. These wild cats hunt during the day and sleep most of the night. They are predators and eat living prey."}]
