[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footspeed", "passage_text": "Footspeed, or sprint speed, is the maximum speed at which a human can run. It is affected by many factors, varies greatly throughout the population, and is important in athletics and many sports, such as association football, rugby, American football, track and field, and basketball. The average human has an almost-equal ratio of fast-twitch to slow-twitch fibers, but top sprinters may have as much as 80% fast-twitch fibers, while top long-distance runners may have only 20%. This ratio is believed to have genetic origins, though some assert that it can be adjusted by muscle training."}, {"url": "https://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080110181036AA3lzXA", "passage_text": "The highest human footspeed ever recorded is 48 km/h (29.8 mph), seen during a 100 meter sprint by Asafa Powell. (His average speed over that distance was 36.96 km/h (22.95 mph) owing to the need for acceleration.) 4 to 6 seconds is average for a 40 yd dash and 12-13 seconds is average for a 100 yard. Speed depends on the following Distance of race Age Gender For example if you run the 100m in 10.00 seconds (=10 meters per second) there is no way you can acieve the same speed for anything shorter beacuse genitically human beings are build with slightly higher levels of speed endurance than acseleration speed."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_fast_can_the_average_man_sprint", "passage_text": "Making the world better, one answer at a time.
