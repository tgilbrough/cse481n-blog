The number and length of timeouts varies widely among various basketball leagues. For example, high school rules allow for five timeouts for each team during the course of the game. Three of those timeouts are 60 seconds in length, while two are 30 seconds. In college basketball, televised games feature four timeouts per half, to allow for commercial breaks.

In high school and college basketball, players on the court or the coach may call timeouts. In the NBA, only players in the court are permitted to call timeouts.

But there is no such thing as a full time out, as officials don\u2019t call a half a full timre out on a 30 second timeout. Any additional time outs will result in a technical foul."}]
