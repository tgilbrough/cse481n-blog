[{"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_temperature_on_Venus", "passage_text": "The surface temperature on the planet Venus is almost uniform planet-wide, even at the poles and even at night. This is about 464\u00b0C (867\u00b0F). The heat is carried by convectio \u2026 n through its thick atmosphere, which blocks 60% of the sunlight but also prevents the surface from cooling by infrared radiation. It is this hot because it is the second planet from the sun, and has what scientists call a 'runaway greenhouse' effect. A thick layer of clouds (carbon dioxide and some sulphuric acid) covers the surface and traps infrared radiation, raising the surface temperature of the planet."}, {"url": "http://www.space.com/18526-venus-temperature.html", "passage_text": "The average temperature on Venus is 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius). Temperature changes slightly traveling through the atmosphere, growing cooler farther away from the surface. Lead would melt on the surface of the planet, where the temperature is around 872 F (467 C). Temperatures are cooler in the upper atmosphere, ranging from (minus 43 C) to (minus 173 C)."}, {"url": "http://zebu.uoregon.edu/disted/ph121/l13.html", "passage_text": "Atmosphere: The surface temperature of Venus is around 890 degrees F, the hottest average temperature in the Solar System. This is due to a runaway greenhouse effect. The atmosphere of Venus is composed of 97% CO2, 2% N2 and less than 1% of O2, H2O and CH4 (methane). Since CO2 is a major greenhouse gas, the radiation from the Sun is trapped in the atmosphere of Venus producing an extremely high surface temperature."}, {"url": "http://www.universetoday.com/14306/temperature-of-venus/", "passage_text": "But on Venus, the surface temperature is 460 degrees Celsius, day or night, at the poles or at the equator. Beyond its thick atmosphere, Venus\u2019 axial tilt (aka. obliquity) plays a role in this temperature consistency. However, for all the characteristics these two planets have in common, average temperature is not one of them. Whereas the Earth has an average surface temperature of 14 degrees Celsius, the average temperature of Venus is 460 degrees Celsius. That is roughly 410 degrees hotter than the hottest deserts on our planet"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus", "passage_text": "Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's sister planet because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It has no natural satellite. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. After the Moon, it is the brightest natural object in the night sky, reaching an apparent magnitude of \u22124.6, bright enough to cast shadows."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus", "passage_text": "This makes the Venusian surface hotter than Mercury 's, which has a minimum surface temperature of 55 K (\u2212220 \u00b0C) and maximum surface temperature of 695 K (420 \u00b0C), even though Venus is nearly twice Mercury's distance from the Sun and thus receives only 25% of Mercury's solar irradiance.
