The encoded protein is a calcium-binding, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein that interacts transiently with newly synthesized N-linked glycoproteins, facilitating protein folding and assembly. 1 human delta opioid receptor (hdeltaOR) exists in a ternary complex with SERCA2b and the ER molecular chaperone calnexin. 2  Env interacts with intracellular CNX and extracellular PDI via discrete, largely nonoverlapping, regions."}, {"url": "http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/calreticulin-a-multifaceted-protein-14237270", "passage_text": "This domain contains a binding site with a high affinity for calcium and a lectin-like chaperone site \u2014 lectin is a protein that interacts with sugar residues. This suggests that CRT, like many proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, participates in calcium metabolism and interactions with glycoproteins. CRT contains a cleavable signal sequence in this domain, which is found in proteins that are marked for targeting to the ER, and the presence of this signal indicates that CRT is transported into the ER following synthesis.

The zinc binding sites are localized to the N-domain. Associates with PDIA3 through the tip of the extended arm formed by the P-domain. Belongs to the calreticulin family. This lectin interacts transiently with almost all of the monoglucosylated glycoproteins that are synthesized in the ER. Interacts with the DNA-binding domain of NR3C1 and mediates its nuclear export.

In this patient, the CALR mutation was a deletion (p.L367fs*46), which was detected in two samples obtained before interferon alfa therapy and was reduced in two subsequent samples (Figure 1).
