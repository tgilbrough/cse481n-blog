In short they are landforms formed by volcanic activities outside the earth's crust. Eg: Lava Planes and Basalt Plateaux such as snake basin,USA and the Deccan Plateau in India.

Landforms and Features of volcanic activity There are many features of volcanic activity. EXTRUSIVE features are those that extrude onto the surface and are hence surface landforms. The major types are all volcanoes of various shapes and forms, but there are much smaller types too. INTRUSIVE volcanic features are intruded into the lithosphere or rock, there they cool and solidify into rocks and are later exposed at the land surface as erosion and weathering DENUDE the land downwards.

Extrusive landforms are created by igneous activity at the surface of the earth. There is wide range of volcanic landforms that includes large depressions (calderas and Maars), conical mountains (volcanoes), and broad lava plains and plateaus. The size and shape of these landforms is controlled by a number of factors most of which are listed below."}, {"url": "http://www.acegeography.com/intrusive-volcanic-landforms.html", "passage_text": "Most of the magma is intruded into the crust where it solidifies into a range of features. These are often exposed at the surface by later erosion. Batholiths are formed deep below the surface when large masses of magma cool and solidify. As the magma cools slowly, large crystals are formed in the rock (e.g. granite). Batholiths are often dome-shaped and exposed by later erosion. This is the case on Dartmoor (left) and on the Isle of Arran. Batholiths can be several hundreds of kilometres in diameter"}, {"url": "https://prezi.com/sjxx9edtf2fz/volcanic-features-intrusive-extrusive/", "passage_text": "Intrusive Volcanic Activity Intrusive or Extrusive... - This takes place place beneath the Earth's surface. - It includes the formation of large magma chambers and magma being forced into the crust through cracks in the rock. - Magma in intrusive volcanic features cools, crystallizes and solidifies into igneous rocks below the surface. Slow cooling results in large crystals forming-typical of rocks such as granite and dolerite.
