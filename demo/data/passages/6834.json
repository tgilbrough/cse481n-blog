A neutralization reaction occurs when an acid and a base (usually both are in aqueous solutions) react to form water and a salt, which do not exhibit any of the acid or base properties. An acid is identified by being paired with a hydrogen ion and a base is identified by being paired with a hydroxide group."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_a_neutralization_reaction", "passage_text": "A neutralization reaction is a chemical reaction in which an acid and a base combine. Generally, this involves the combination of a hydronium ion (H3O+) with a hydroxide ion (\u2026 OH-) to form water (2H2O)."}, {"url": "http://ch302.cm.utexas.edu/chemEQ/neutralizations/selector.php?name=neutralization-rxns", "passage_text": "A neutralization reaction is the reaction of an acid and base.

The word neutralization is used because the acid and base properties of H + and OH-are destroyed or neutralized. In the reaction, H + and OH-combine to form HOH or H 2 O or water molecules. A neutralization is a type of double replacement reaction. A salt is the product of an acid-base reaction and is a much broader term then common table salt as shown in the firs"}, {"url": "http://www.sparknotes.com/testprep/books/sat2/chemistry/chapter6section6.rhtml", "passage_text": "Acid\u2013Base Reactions: Neutralization Reactions. When a strong acid and a strong base solution are mixed, a neutralization reaction occurs, and the products do not have characteristics of either acids or bases. Instead, a neutral salt and water are formed."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/neutralization-reaction-definition-equation-examples.html", "passage_text": "Neutralization is a type of chemical reaction in which a strong acid and strong base react with each other to form water and salt.
