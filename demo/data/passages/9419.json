A heel spur is an extra growth on the bone of the heel that can build up over a long period. Heel spurs are more common among people who experience heel pain, though the spur doesn\u2019t actually cause any pain. A heel spur, also known as a calcaneal spur, may stick out by as much as 1.25cm (half an inch).

Heel spurs are most commonly caused by strain injury of the tendons and tissues that attach to the heel bone (calcaneus). This can occur after repetitive athletic stress or strain injury. A heel spur is a bony outgrowth of the calcaneus bone in the heel. Heel spurs are attributed to chronic local inflammation at the insertion of soft-tissue ligaments or fascia in the area. Heel spurs can be located at the back of the heel or under the heel, beneath the sole of the foot."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/heel-spurs-pain-causes-symptoms-treatments", "passage_text": "Symptoms of Heel Spurs. Heel spurs often cause no symptoms. But heel spurs can be associated with intermittent or chronic pain -- especially while walking, jogging, or running -- if inflammation develops at the point of the spur formation.

The heel pain associated with heel spurs and plantar fasciitis may not respond well to rest.

Plantar fascia \u2014the band of connective tissue on the bottom of your foot that stretches from the heel to the ball of your foot\u2014supports your foot\u2019s arch. If this tissue becomes inflamed, you\u2019ll generally feel the pain in your heel. Eventually, hook-shaped calcium deposits, also known as bone or heel spurs, may form on your heel bone and cause further pain. Structural issues with the arch of your foot can lead to this cycle of inflammation, spur growth, and pain."}]
