[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycle", "passage_text": "In Earth science, a biogeochemical cycle or substance turnover or cycling of substances is a pathway by which a chemical substance moves through both biotic (biosphere) and abiotic (lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere) compartments of Earth. The most well-known and important biogeochemical cycles, for example, include. 1  the carbon cycle, 2  the nitrogen cycle, 3  the oxygen cycle, 4  the phosphorus cycle, 5  the sulphur cycle, 6  the water cycle, 7  and the rock cycle."}, {"url": "http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/the-nitrogen-cycle-processes-players-and-human-15644632", "passage_text": "In fact, some predict that by 2030, the amount of nitrogen fixed by human activities will exceed that fixed by microbial processes (Vitousek 1997). Increases in available nitrogen can alter ecosystems by increasing primary productivity and impacting carbon storage (Galloway et al. 1994). In terrestrial ecosystems, the addition of nitrogen can lead to nutrient imbalance in trees, changes in forest health, and declines in biodiversity. With increased nitrogen availability there is often a change in carbon storage, thus impacting more processes than just the nitrogen cycle."}, {"url": "http://water.usgs.gov/edu/nitrogen.html", "passage_text": "Nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are essential for plant and animal growth and nourishment, but the overabundance of certain nutrients in water can cause a number of adverse health and ecological effects. Nitrogen, in the forms of nitrate, nitrite, or ammonium, is a nutrient needed for plant growth. Excess nitrogen in water can harm people. Too much nitrogen, as nitrate, in drinking water can be harmful to young infants or young livestock. Excessive nitrate can result in restriction of oxygen transport in the bloodstream."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycle", "passage_text": "The term biogeochemical tells us that biological, geological and chemical factors are all involved. The circulation of chemical nutrients like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, and water etc. through the biological and physical world are known as biogeochemical cycles. In effect, the element is recycled, although in some cycles there may be places (called reservoirs) where the element is accumulated or held for a long period of time (such as an ocean or lake for water). The most well-known and important biogeochemical cycles, for example, include. 1  the carbon cycle, 2  the nitrogen cycle, 3  the oxygen cycle, 4  the phosphorus cycle, 5  the sulphur cycle, 6  the water cycle, 7  and the rock cycle."}, {"url": "http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/sg118", "passage_text": "As they rise through the water column, these algae take up nitrogen and can attain bloom levels by the time they reach the surface. Just controlling external inputs of phosphorus may have a limited impact on Microcystis and its negative effects, depending on the ecosystem\u2019s internal reserves of phosphorus. Figure 2.

Nitrogen and phosphorus are two nutrients that are essential for the growth and survival of plants and animals, but often are present in short supply. Both nitrogen and phosphorus are applied regularly through fertilizer to increase the yield of crops needed to feed human populations.
