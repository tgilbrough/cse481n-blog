The interquartile range uses 50% of the data. It is a measure of the central tendency just like the standard deviation. A small interquartile range means that most of the values lie close to each other. The Inter-quartile range is the range of the middle half of the data. It is the difference between the upper and lower quartile. Example: 35,80,100 110,120,120,170,180. Th \u2026 e Inter-quartile range would be 145-90 or 55 To find the interquartile range, you: 1) Arrange the data in numerical order."}, {"url": "http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/a3121120.nsf/home/statistical+language+-+measures+of+spread", "passage_text": "10. 11. The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the upper (Q3) and lower (Q1) quartiles, and describes the middle 50% of values when ordered from lowest to highest. The IQR is often seen as a better measure of spread than the range as it is not affected by outliers.

It is computed as one half the difference between the 75th percentile [often called (Q3)] and the 25th percentile (Q1). The formula for semi-interquartile range is therefore: (Q3-Q1)/2.

Coach Taylor can use the interquartile range to summarize the overall accuracy of his players. To find the quartiles of this data set use the following steps: 1  Order the data from least to greatest. To find the interquartile range, simply take the upper quartile and subtract the lower quartile: 7.5 - 2.5 = 5. The interquartile range for this data set is 5.
