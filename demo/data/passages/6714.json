RNA is transcribed in the nucleus; processed, it is transported to the cytoplasm and translated by the ribosome. At the end of its life, the mRNA is degraded. In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by RNA polymerase.In simple word or formation of RNA from DNA is known as transcription. This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to transfer RNA, which carries amino acids. Only after certain transcription factors are attached to the promoter does the RNA polymerase bind to it. The completed assembly of transcription factors and RNA polymerase bind to the promoter, forming a transcription initiation complex. Transcription in the archaea domain is similar to transcription in eukaryotes."}, {"url": "http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/RNA-Transcription-by-RNA-Polymerase-Prokaryotes-vs-961", "passage_text": "Eukaryotic cells are more complex than bacteria in many ways, including in terms of transcription. Specifically, in eukaryotes, transcription is achieved by three different types of RNA polymerase (RNA pol I-III). These elements differ among bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, all transcription is performed by a single type of RNA polymerase. This polymerase contains four catalytic subunits and a single regulatory subunit known as sigma (s)."}, {"url": "http://oregonstate.edu/dept/biochem/hhmi/hhmiclasses/bb451/lectnotesgdp/EukaryoticmRNA.html", "passage_text": "Eukaryotic mRNA Processing. Unlike prokaryotes which have one RNA polymerase that makes all classes of RNA molecules, eukaryotic cells have three types of RNA polymerase (called RNA pol I, RNA pol II, and RNA pol III), and each type of RNA is made by its own polymerase: The process by which introns are removed is referred to as splicing. The sequences remaining after the splicing are called exons. All of the different major types of RNA in a eukaryotic cell can have introns. Although most higher eukaryotic genes have introns, some do not."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA", "passage_text": "Transcription is when RNA is made from DNA. During transcription, RNA polymerase makes a copy of a gene from the DNA to mRNA as needed. This process is similar in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Finally, the mRNA is degraded.
