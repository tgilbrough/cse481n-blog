In 2002, the cost of installing blocks per square foot was roughly $3, including labor and materials. During the same year, the cost of installing poured concrete was around $6 per square foot, including material and labor. As of 2010, even though the labor cost has remained the same, the material costs have risen by $1. However, these costs change when you remove the labor cost from the two and decide to do it yourself. The concrete block price drops by $1 per square foot, and the poured concrete price drops by $3."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/info_7931795_cost-foundation-cinder-block-foundation.html", "passage_text": "Considerations. Extras can drive up the cost of both a concrete foundation and concrete block. For instance, an exposed poured concrete foundation may be colored or faux-finished to look like stone. This can increase the cost of your foundation to as much as $4.50 per square foot. The price of concrete varies by region, but as of 2008, it averaged around $75 per cubic yard, or just under $3 per cubic foot. Concrete also requires forms and finishing work at between $1 and $1.50 per square foot and reinforcement with rebar or mesh at a cost of about $.1"}, {"url": "http://www.askthebuilder.com/poured-concrete-vs-block-walls/", "passage_text": "Vertical reinforcing steel is also very important. This steel can be put in both a poured concrete foundation and a concrete block wall that will have the hollow voids filled with cement grout or pea gravel concrete. After the concrete blocks are laid, the voids can be filled with a cement-based mortar or poured concrete that contains small pea gravel.

Poured retaining walls with elaborate curves require complex formwork and will drive up cost for a wall.

The complete process of installing concrete forms, pouring the concrete, and breaking the forms down can take as little as 2 or 3 partial days of work. Poured concrete foundations are usually 6-10 inches thick and joint-free, unlike concrete block walls. Consequently they are considered to produce stronger and drier foundation walls, critical for basement walls. Standard concrete blocks contain hollow cells designed to support rebar / steel reinforcing rods, as well as poured concrete/mortar, to maximize wall strength. Besides the standard size concrete block there are a number of alternative sizes, shapes, textures and color tones to choose from."}, {"url": "http://home.costhelper.com/house-foundation.html", "passage_text": "1 A slab foundation for an average 1,600- to 1,800-square-foot family home might cost about $7,000-$16,000 or more, while a slab foundation for a 3,000- to 4,500-square-foot home might cost $13,000-$40,000 or more. 1 And an Illinois log cabin owner-builder estimates about $17,000 in costs for a 24'x36' basement foundation with 8' walls with the concrete poured professionally but the rest done as a serious DIY project.."}]
