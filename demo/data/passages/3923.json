The multitronic entertains no compromises-whether in terms of dynamism, convenience or economy-in translating the driver's preferences into road performance. As matters stand, it can justifiably claim to be the concept that translates the driver's intentions with the greatest degree of accuracy."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitronic", "passage_text": "Multitronic offers performance and economy similar to, and in some cases better than, the equivalent five-speed manual gearboxes, and superior to the traditional automatic transmission. Particular performance advantages are noticed with 'in-gear' seamless acceleration times over equivalent manual transmission cars. The transmission is monitored and regulated by Audi 's Dynamic Regulating Programme (DRP), which tracks the driver's inputs (from how the driver applies the throttle pedal), driving conditions, and engine load-to compute the optimal gear ratio for fuel efficiency or maximum performance, as mandated by the user."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitronic", "passage_text": "The Multitronic system uses a link-plate chain drive, an oil-cooled multi-plate clutch (initially of six parts, later of seven to enable it to cope better with the high torque outputs of larger turbodiesel engines), and complex electronics, to overcome the traditional shortcomings of CVTs. The transmission is monitored and regulated by Audi 's Dynamic Regulating Programme (DRP), which tracks the driver's inputs (from how the driver applies the throttle pedal), driving conditions, and engine load-to compute the optimal gear ratio for fuel efficiency or maximum performance, as mandated by the user."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitronic", "passage_text": "Multitronic is a stepless transmission launched by AUDI AG in late 1999, jointly developed and manufactured by LuK, a division of the Schaeffler Group The capitalization used is multitronic (spelled by Audi with a lower-case leading 'm') and is a registered trademark of AUDI AG.

Tiptronic/multitronic is essentially a automatic transmission with the ability to be turned into a manual without a clutch.
