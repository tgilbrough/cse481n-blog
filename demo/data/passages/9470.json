We have reviewed the studies that provide the current standards of reference for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in normal children from 14 days to 12 years of postnatal age. These standards currently are presented as ml/min per 1.73 m 2, i.e., adjusted to average adult body surface area"}, {"url": "http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/7/2664.full", "passage_text": "However, we know that GFR physiologically decreases with age, and in adults older than 70 years, values below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 could be considered normal. Following the \u2018prognostic way\u2019, the fixed cut-off of 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 has been retained in the K-DIGO guidelines. Conclusions. The K-DIGO recommendations define GFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as a disease, regardless of age. This recommendation is based on eGFR and on the higher risk of mortality associated with eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [ 5 ]."}, {"url": "http://www.renal.org/information-resources/the-uk-eckd-guide/normal-gfr", "passage_text": "When GFR is over 60.
