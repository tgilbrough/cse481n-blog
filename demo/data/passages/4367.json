Peacock eggs will hatch within 28 to 30 days of beginning the incubation process. On day 26, move the eggs into the hatching space and do not touch or turn at all.

As the chicks hatch, move them into a safe space for rearing."}, {"url": "http://www.fertilehatchingeggs.net/peacock/", "passage_text": "The natural method is not commercially viable as the peahen will be able to hatch only a limited number of eggs.

The temperature should be measured in many locations to insure that the proper temperature is kept throughout the incubator. The thermostat should be set so that a temperature of 99 -100 degrees F is consistent throughout."}]
