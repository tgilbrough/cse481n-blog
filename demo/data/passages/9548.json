A high recurrence rate of mitral regurgitation has led physicians to use smaller annuloplasty ring sizes [3] . It appears therefore that the small annuloplasty ring is, at the very least, not harmful. It seems that exercise performance by our patients might be limited by an array of other factors, including preexisting heart disease, which, in cases of functional mitral regurgitation, is primary to a valvular problem."}, {"url": "http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/annuloplasty", "passage_text": "Supply of surgical heart valves, annuloplasty rings, cardiovascular ... by Mena Report.

The surgeon can estimate the dimensions of the patient\u2019s mitral valve and decide on an appropriate ring size. Depending on the disease etiology, different approaches are taken. Surgeons can decide to undersize the device, truesize the device, or oversize it. The goal of mitral valve annuloplasty is to regain mitral valve competence by restoring the physiological form and function of the normal mitral valve apparatus.

The disease is categorized as moderate-to-severe. Well\u2026 It makes sense that if the diameter of the valve opening is larger than the extent to which the valve leaflets close, this can be a serious risk to the patient due to heart valve leakage.
