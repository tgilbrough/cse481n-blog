Edit at Wikipedia... Sodium chloride, also known as salt, common salt, table salt or halite, is an ionic compound with the chemical formula NaCl, representing a 1:1 ratio of sodium and chloride ions. Sodium chloride is the salt most responsible for the salinity of seawater and of the extracellular fluid of many multicellular organism s. In the form of edible or table salt it is commonly used as a condiment and food preservative. Large quantities of sodium chloride are used in many industrial processes, and it is a major source of sodium and chlorine compounds used as feedstocks for further chemical syntheses."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride", "passage_text": "When dissolved in water, the sodium chloride framework disintegrates as the Na + and Cl \u2212 ions become surrounded by the polar water molecules.
