Galactosidase and pectinesterase enzymes are abundantly found in tomatoes and are responsible for it ripening and eventually becoming soft and mushy. These enzymes have been isolated and extracted and are available in the form of tablets and capsules for convenience of use. They help to supplement the enzymes already present in our body and improve health. A ripe tomato is a rich source and should be preferably eaten daily to attain maximum benefits. The usefulness of tomato enzymes for the human body has been better understood in the past couple of years and some of the important functions are listed in the blog below. Uses And Functions of Tomato Enzyme. As Antioxidant-A recent study concluded that the enzyme in tomato is a powerful antioxidant and along with lycopene, another important constituent, it can combat the harmful effects of free radicals that are produced by our body with every breath of oxygen that we breathe in"}, {"url": "http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/153/1/80.full", "passage_text": "Enzymes interact to generate metabolic networks. The activities of more than 22 enzymes from central metabolism were profiled during the development of fruit of the modern tomato cultivar Solanum lycopersicum \u2018M82\u2019 and its wild relative Solanum pennellii (LA0716). More recently, these studies of enzyme activities have been complemented by proteomic analyses during fruit ripening (Rose et al., 2004; Faurobert et al., 2007). We have now investigated the activities of 28 enzymes during tomato fruit development, located in most of the major pathways in central metabolism."}, {"url": "http://iosrjournals.org/iosr-jpbs/papers/Vol5-issue5/F0552935.pdf", "passage_text": "4.2 Protease The activity of protease was taken after every 2 minutes at 540 nm. The change in absorbance value was noted after incubating the sample for 30 minutes to enhance the activity of Protease enzyme (Fig.4). Protease activity of tomato at 0 minute was found to be 1.55.

A central composite design was used to optimize the enzyme-assisted extraction of lycopene from the peel fraction of tomato processing waste.
