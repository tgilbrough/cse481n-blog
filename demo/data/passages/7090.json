Most places won't let you use a gift card to buy a gift card. You would have to ask Gamestop about their policy on that. I can at mine, you just give them the card and maybe some cash depending on how much was on the card, and then you buy it. Considering the Gamestop giftcard is to be used in Gamestop, though, I highly doubt they'll want you using it directly on Steam. After all, I'd imagine Valve give a percentage cut to Gamestop for every Steam Wallet code they sell."}, {"url": "http://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/10/864956555002735630/", "passage_text": "Using Gamestop giftcards on Steam...

Gamestop has no affiliation with Steam. It's like going to Best Buy and trying to use your Wal-Mart gift card. You'll get some funny looks. Though, Gamestop will sell many games offered on Steam and these games will use the Steam platform for distribution, updates, protection, ect.
