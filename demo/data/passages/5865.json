The monomers may be the same or slightly different. Macromolecules are formed by dehydration reactions in which water molecules are removed from the formation of bonds. Four main types of macromolecules control all activities. They are proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids and lipids. Their monomers are amino acids, sugars, nucleosides and glycerol and fatty acids."}, {"url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/An_Introduction_to_Molecular_Biology/Macromolecules_and_Cells", "passage_text": "Proteins are polymer of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. Amino acids can be divided into two group essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids.

Fats are large molecules made of two types of molecules, glycerol and some type of fatty acid.
