The total carbon footprint cannot be calculated because of the large amount of data required and the fact that carbon dioxide can be produced by natural occurrences. Once the size of a carbon footprint is known, a strategy can be devised to reduce it, e.g. by technological developments, better process and product management, changed Green Public or Private Procurement (GPP), carbon capture, consumption strategies, carbon offsetting and others."}, {"url": "https://carbonfund.org/reduce/", "passage_text": "how to reduce your carbon footprint. Reduce What You Can, Offset What You Can\u2019t.\u2122. That\u2019s our motto, and we\u2019re proud of it. Everyone has a responsibility to reduce their individual carbon footprint, and there are lots of ways to do so. We encourage everyone to think about their lifestyle decisions and find opportunities to reduce their climate impact.

There are many actions you can take to reduce your carbon footprint. The way we travel, for example, has a major impact on our environment. Use your bike or walk for short distances. Public transport is a way of getting to places without putting a burden on the environment. It measures the amount of fossil fuels and electricity someone uses up as well as the carbon footprint of the products they buy. When we use our cars or heat our homes with oil or natural gas, carbon dioxide and various other gases are set free. These emissions lead to a denser atmosphere and global warming. You can measure your carbon footprint by using a calculator that you can find on various websites"}, {"url": "http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/carbon-footprint.htm", "passage_text": "Carbon offsets let you pay to reduce the global greenhouse gas total instead of making radical reductions of your own.
