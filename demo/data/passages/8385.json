At one time or another, we all prevent ourselves from learning. These barriers often come in two forms: learning defences general ways we actively prevent ourselves from learning. The more difficult a learning goal is to reach, the more likely that you will create excuses and/or reasons for not reaching the goal. Stress in reaching a learning goal. You will be less motivated to reach a learning goal that you perceive to involve a lot of stress than one you believe to be stress-free."}, {"url": "http://www.accessiblecampus.ca/educators/intro-to-accessible-education/understanding-barriers/", "passage_text": "As an educator, you can help to remove organizational or systemic barriers in a number of ways: 1  Identify and clearly express essential course content and provide flexibility so that students can express their understanding of essential course content in multiple ways.

Beagley L(1). Author information: (1)Swedish Covenant Hospital, 5140 N. California Ave, Chicago, IL 60625, USA. lbeagley@schosp.org. Health care delivery and education has become a challenge for providers. Patients and their families are given a multitude of information about their health and commonly must make important decisions from these facts. Obstacles that prevent easy delivery of health care information include literacy, culture, language, and physiological barriers. It is up to the nurse to assess and evaluate the patient's learning needs and readiness to learn because everyone learns differently. This article will examine how each of these barriers impact care delivery along with teaching and learning strategies will be examined"}, {"url": "http://www.skills-universe.com/xn/detail/2671568:Topic:70285", "passage_text": "UNDERSTANDING BARRIERS TO LEARNING.
