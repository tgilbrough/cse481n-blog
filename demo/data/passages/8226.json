The gastric glands open to the surface of the mucosa through tiny holes called gastric pits. Four different types of cells make up the gastric glands: 1  Mucous cells. Stomach. The stomach, which receives food from the esophagus, is located in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. The stomach is divided into the fundic, cardiac, body, and pyloric regions.

These cells produce a thick coating of mucus, that protects the gastric mucosa from acid and enzymes in the lumen. Even so, these cells have to be replaced after 4-6 days. When the stomach is empty, and not distended, the lining is thrown up into folds called rugae. After eating, these folds flatten, and the stomach is able to distend greatly. The stomach has three anatomical regions: 1  cardiac, which contains mucous secreting glands (called cardiac glands) and is closest to the oesophagus. 2  fundus, the body or largest part of the stomach which contain the gastric (fundic) glands. 3  pyloric, which secretes two types of mucus, and the hormone gastrin"}, {"url": "http://www.siumed.edu/~dking2/erg/stomach.htm", "passage_text": "Beneath the gastric pits, the mucosa of the stomach is filled with closely packed tubular glands, which differ by region (i.e., cardiac, fundic, pyloric). Histologically, most of the stomach wall contains gastric glands (or fundic glands). These consist primarily of parietal cells and chief cells. Images.
