The normal platelet count ranges between 150,000 and 450,000 per microliter (one-millionth of a liter). Although the number of platelets is decreased, their function may remain intact in most cases of thrombocytopenia. All blood cells (white cells, red cells, and platelets) are made in the bone marrow. Thrombocytopenia means a lower platelet count in the blood compared to the normal range. Thrombocytosis refers to a greater number of platelets"}, {"url": "http://answers.webmd.com/answers/1198204/what-is-a-normal-platelet-count", "passage_text": "78 Followers. A. Platelets are the tiny blood cells that help stop bleeding by binding together to form a clump or plug at sites of injury inside blood vessels. A normal platelet count is between 150,000 and 450,000 platelets per microliter (one-millionth of a liter, abbreviated mcL). The average platelet count is 237,000 per mcL in men and 266,000 per mcL in women. A platelet count below 150,000 per mcL is called thrombocytopenia, while a platelet count over 450,000 is called thrombocytosis. Platelets seem to have a large backup capacity: blood typically still clots normally as long as the platelet count is above 50,000 per mcL (assuming no other problems are present)."}, {"url": "http://www.lifescript.com/health/centers/rheumatoid_arthritis/s.aspx?query=what+is+normal+platelet+count", "passage_text": "Low Platelet Counts.
