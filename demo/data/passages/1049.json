Most of the cell's life processes occur in the cytoplasm.   3. Cytoskeleton, framework of cytoplasm, \u2026 helps the cell maintain or  change its shape and enables some cells to move.   4. Cytoplasm constantly flows inside the cell membrane. A cytoplasm is the water-based gel in which the organelles of all  living things are suspended in a cell   a cytoplasm is the inside of a cell."}, {"url": "http://www.innovateus.net/innopedia/what-are-functions-cytoplasm", "passage_text": "Based on their function, cells are categorized into different types of cells, the somatic cells and the reproductive cells. Each cell has a nucleus and a jellylike watery substance that is 80% water that occupies the remaining part of the cell. This is called Cytoplasm. Cytoplasm can be divided into: Cytosol, organelles and cytoplasmic inclusions. Cytosol is a gelatinous material and most of the space in cytoplasm when an organelle is not present. Cytosol comprises of salt, water, cytoskeleton filaments and organic molecules."}, {"url": "http://www.knowswhy.com/why-do-cells-need-water/", "passage_text": "A\u201a\u00e3\u00b7 A \u00e2 the cytoplasm in the cell consists mainly of water and, dissolved, nutrients, wastes ions proteins and.

It is a general term for the cytoplasm. Protoplasm is composed of a mixture of small molecules such as ions, amino acids, monosaccharides and water, and macromolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and polysaccharides. In eukaryotes the protoplasm surrounding the cell nucleus is known as the cytoplasm and that inside the nucleus as the nucleoplasm"}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Why_is_the_cytoplasm_important", "passage_text": "The cytoplasm is important, because without it, the organelles inside the cell won't be able to function.
