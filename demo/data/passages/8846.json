Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by some Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and are responsible for resistance to a broad class of-beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin. There are several groups and classes of beta-lactamases that result in antibiotic resistance. For example, several class C beta-lactamases result in cephalosporin resistance and some class A beta-lactamases confer resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins, cephamycins and carbapenems.
