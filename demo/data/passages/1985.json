This tests for the presence of virus. A positive or reactive HBsAg test result means that the person is infected with the hepatitis B virus, which can be an acute or a chronic infection. Infected people can pass the virus on to others through their blood and infected bodily fluids. as far as for hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb or anti-HBs)."}, {"url": "https://www.healthtap.com/topics/hbsag-reactive-means", "passage_text": "Some tests detect part of the virus, such as surface antigen (hbsag), the core antigen, or hbv dna. The presence of hbsag indicates that the person is potentially infectious. Hbsab replaces hbsag as the hbv infection evolves to immunity. ...Read more.

However, those with \u2026 a negative result but a recent exposure to HIV should get another test at least 3 months after the possible exposure. This stands for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen.

Some of the tests detect antibodies produced in response to HBV infection; some detect antigens produced by the virus, and others detect viral DNA. The main uses for HBV tests include: 1 To determine whether acute signs and symptoms are due to HBV infection; two tests, hepatitis B surface Ag and hepatitis B core antibody IgM, may be performed as part of an acute viral hepatitis panel along with tests for hepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis C (HCV) to determine which virus may be causing the infection."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070702082827AASnGSM", "passage_text": "Answers. Best Answer: HBsAG means you have the antigen, or Hep B virus. The HBsAB means you have the antibodies as your body tries to fight off the virus. This test will always show reactive from now on.

Best Answer: A non reactive HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antiGEN) tells you nothing about your immunity to hepatitis B, only that you don't currently have the infection. If you are trying to work out if you need hep B vaccination you should check the levels of anti-HBs (hepatitis B surface antiBODY). Check out this website http://www.immunize.org/askexperts/exper... there's a table telling you what the results of the Hep B mean, but generally non-reactive means your body (blood in this case) doesn't react to the presence of HBsAg, which means you are negative for Hep B.
