[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan", "passage_text": "Tryptophan is a routine constituent of most protein-based foods or dietary proteins. It is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, spirulina, bananas, and peanuts. Since tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is subsequently converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin, it has been proposed that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may therefore improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain."}, {"url": "http://www.csun.edu/~hcbio027/biotechnology/lec4a/trp.html", "passage_text": "The trp operon (see diagram below) encodes the genes for the synthesis of tryptophan. This cluster of genes, like the lac operon, is regulated by a repressor that binds to the operator sequences. The activity of the trp repressor for binding the operator region is enhanced when it binds tryptophan; in this capacity, tryptophan is known as a corepressor. Since the activity of the trp repressor is enhanced in the presence of tryptophan, the rate of expression of the trp operon is graded in response to the level of tryptophan in the cell. Expression of the trp operon is also regulated by attenuation"}, {"url": "https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc431/prokaryo/prokaryo3.htm", "passage_text": "trp Operon Transcription Under High Levels of Tryptophan. When the cellular levels of tryptophan are high, the levels of the tryptophan tRNA are also high. Immediately after transcription, the mRNA moves quickly through the ribosome complex and the small peptide is translated. Translation is quick because of the high levels of tryptophan tRNA"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan", "passage_text": "In bacteria that synthesize tryptophan, high cellular levels of this amino acid activate a repressor protein, which binds to the trp operon. Binding of this repressor to the tryptophan operon prevents transcription of downstream DNA that codes for the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan.

That said, there are foods and some nutrients that can increase levels of tryptophan, the amino acid from which serotonin is made. Protein-rich foods, such as meat or chicken, contain high levels of tryptophans. Tryptophan appears in dairy foods, nuts, and fowl. "}, {"url": "https://www.integrativepsychiatry.net/serotonin.html", "passage_text": "Serotonin is synthesized in the brain and body from tryptophan an amino acid. Tryptophan converts into 5- hydroxytryptophan then into serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), if all of the co-factors are present. A shortage of tryptophan is believed to be a major culprit leading to depression. Natural Serotonin is involved in the regulation of several processes within the brain, including, depression, mood, emotions, aggression, sleep, appetite, anxiety, memory and perceptions. Serotonin regulates these processes through pathways that innervate (connect to) different brain regions."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trp_operon", "passage_text": "Structure of the trp operon. The trp operon is an operon \u2014 a group of genes that are used, or transcribed, together \u2014 that codes for the components for production of tryptophan. The trp operon is present in many bacteria, but was first characterized in Escherichia coli. The operon is regulated so that when tryptophan is present in the environment, the genes for tryptophan synthesis are not expressed. It was an important experimental system for learning about gene regulation, and is commonly used to teach gene regulatio"}, {"url": "http://www.progressivehealth.com/low-serotonin-symptoms.htm", "passage_text": "Supplements can also be taken to help improve serotonin levels. The most important of these is tryptophan supplements. A tryptophan supplement can help increase serotonin levels by increase plasma concentration of tryptophan which then increases the amount of the amino acid that crosses over to the brain. Therefore, the concentration of tryptophan in the blood is high enough for a significant amount to cross over into the brain. Non-essential amino acids such as theanine found mostly in the leaves of green tea may also directly reduce serotonin levels in the brain."}]
