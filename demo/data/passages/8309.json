The heads, which face the outside and inside of the cell, are polar. Thus they form hydrogen bonds with the water outside of the cell and the cytoplasm inside the cell.

In a biological membrane, the phospholipids are organized into a bilayer, which serves as the framework in which the other components of the membrane are embedded.

The fatty acid tails are hydrophobic. This region is not polar. The phosphol \u2026 ipids form a lipid bilayer (two layers of phospholipids) forming the cell wall. The heads face the cytoplasm, and the water outside."}]
