Last week, the taxi cab startup, which is currently valued at $18.2 billion, offered one answer to that question, claiming an Uber driver could earn $90,000 a year working in New York City, and $70,000 in San Francisco. Not a bad take\u2014but also not $90,000. It\u2019s also not a hugely different hourly rate compared to the smart driver, who mostly just works more hours. In short, it seems like very few full-time Uber drivers are earning above $30 per hour."}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-drivers-salary-90000-2014-5", "passage_text": "According to Uber, the median wage for an UberX driver working at least 40 hours a week in New York City is $90,766 a year and $74,191 a year in San Francisco, The Washington Post reports.
