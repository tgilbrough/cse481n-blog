While it's true that birds can and do live for quite a long time, some live longer than others. Birds like Budgies and Cockatiels, for example, can live for up to 20 years in captivity provided that their needs are met and they are well cared for."}, {"url": "http://web.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/How_Long.html", "passage_text": "Common Terns reach old age after about 19 years, and their annual risk of dying then goes up. Life expectancy in birds is closely correlated with size -- the larger the species, the longer it is likely to live.

Usually the smaller the bird, the shorter the lifespan. Larger birds, such as cockatoos and macaws have been known to live up to 100 years or more and often people say that birds like amazons and african greys can live to be 80 years old. These things are indeed true, but it's very rare for a bird in the wild or companion animals do live to their fullest extent."}, {"url": "http://exoticpets.about.com/od/birds/f/birdlifespan.htm", "passage_text": "Answer: Pet birds can be quite long lived -- potential owners need to be aware of the age their bird might reach and be prepared to provide proper care for the bird over its entire life span.

For robins, it's around 50% each year once young birds have fledged. If a robin survives to midwinter, it lives an average of 1.7 years after that. The oldest robins in your yard might be about six years old, although one banded bird lived almost 14 years. [sounds of winter wind ]."}]
