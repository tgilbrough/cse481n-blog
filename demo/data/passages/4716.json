These small, tubular glands are situated within the skin, as well as in the subcutaneous tissue under it. They discharge their fluid through tiny openings in the surface of the skin. Perspiration serves at least two purposes: the removal of waste products such as urea and ammonia, and cooling of the body temperature as sweat evaporates. 2) The transparent, colorless, acidic fluid secreted by the sweat glands. It contains some fatty acids and mineral matter"}, {"url": "http://health.howstuffworks.com/skin-care/information/anatomy/skin-eliminate-waste.htm", "passage_text": "Only tiny amounts of toxins and waste products, like the ammonia and urea mentioned above, are found in sweat. Sweat itself has no odor. The smelly effect is the fault of apocrine glands located in the groin, armpits and other hairy body parts. Sweat glands in the skin also play active roles in the excretory system, or the organs and glands that flush out toxins and excess minerals from the body.

The primary cause of strong-smelling perspiration is bacterial flora. Sweat is naturally odorless, but when it reaches the skin's surface, bacteria that normally live on the skin digest sweat and excrete the strong-smelling waste associated with smelly sweat. Bacteria break down the sweat produced by the apocrine sweat glands.

Therefore, it makes sense that the main component of perspiration is water. However, perspiration also plays a role in excretion of toxins and waste products. Sweat is chemically similar to the plasma, but certain components are selectively retained or excreted. Perspiration consists of water, minerals, lactate and urea.
