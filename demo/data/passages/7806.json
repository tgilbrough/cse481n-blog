Sir Isaac Newton's theory of gravity was written in 1687, however he did not come up with a theory of relativity. The first person to come up with a theory of relativity was Galileo Galilei, but this theory turned out to be incorrect. In a paper in 1905 Albert Einstein built upon Galileo's ideas and produced the special theory of relativity.

There is also a related view (held by behaviourists, for instance) that language and thought are identical. According to this stance thinking is entirely linguistic: there is no 'non-verbal thought', no 'translation' at all from thought to language. In this sense, thought is seen as completely determined by language. The Sapir-Whorf theory, named after the American linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, is a mould theory of language"}]
