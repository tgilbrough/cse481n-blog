Alberta's residential and commercial sectors account for 17 per cent of the province's marketable natural gas consumed in Alberta for home and business heating. The remaining 83 per cent of natural gas consumed in Alberta is used by the industrial, electricity generation, transportation, and other sectors.

Natural gas is one of the cleanest burning fossil fuels. Natural gas can form over time from almost any organic material. It is generally located deep underground in porous rock or trapped between more solid rock formations. The first natural gas well was drilled in 1883 in a field near Medicine Hat, Alberta. A gigajoule (GJ), a unit for measuring natural gas, is the energy equivalent of about 30 litres of gasoline. The average Albertan household uses about 120 GJs of natural gas a year. About 67 per cent of Canada s natural gas production is from Alberta.
