The BMR is the number of calories a specific human needs per day to stay alive. Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body burns daily without your having to do anything. Your body uses around 75 percent of the calories you eat each day just to maintain life and perform basic functions."}, {"url": "http://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html", "passage_text": "Reference.

The more muscle fiber, the higher your BMI as muscle, even at rest, burns significantly more calories than fat and other tissues. This is the reason that strength training is so important to a weight loss program"}, {"url": "http://www.shapefit.com/health/basal-metabolic-rate.html", "passage_text": "Your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is defined as the minimum number of calories your body burns whether at rest, working out or lying down. This means that everyone has a set number of calories that they need in order to stay alive and it\u2019s as different for you as it is for your children, friends, parents or even siblings.

Some of those processes are breathing, blood circulation, controlling body temperature, cell growth, brain and nerve function, and contraction of muscles. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimal rate of energy expenditure per unit time by endothermic animals at rest. (McNab, B. K. 1997).
