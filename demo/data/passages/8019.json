The denser plate, made of oceanic crust, is subducted underneath the less dense plate, which can be either continental or oceanic crust. As a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries. When two plates move towards one another, they form either a subduction zone or a continental collision.

The pressure and friction is great enough at these boundaries that the material in the Earth's mantle can melt, and both earthquakes and volcanoes happen nearby.

The west coast of South America is a convergent boundary between the Nazca plate and the South American plate.

In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary (because of subduction), is an actively deforming region where two (or more) tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere move toward one another and collide. As a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries. When two plates move towards one another, they form either a subduction zone or a continental collision.

Two plates sliding past each other forms a transform plate boundary. Natural or human-made structures that cross a transform boundary are offset\u2014split into pieces and carried in opposite directions. A divergent boundary occurs when two tectonic plates move away from each other. Along these boundaries, lava spews from long fissures and geysers spurt superheated water. Frequent earthquakes strike along the rift.

In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary, is an actively deforming region where two tectonic plates or fragments of lithosphere move toward one another and collide.

A tectonic boundary where two plates are moving toward each other. If the two plates are of equal density, they usually push up against each other to form a mountain chain. If they are of unequal density, one plate usually sinks (subducts) beneath the other. Also called collision zone. "}]
