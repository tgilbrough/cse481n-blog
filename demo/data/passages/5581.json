Although it is small, at approximately 2.5 centimeters long, it serves several important functions."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/midbrain-definition-function-structures.html", "passage_text": "Instructor: Sarah Phenix. In this lesson, we'll explore the midbrain, including where it's located, what structures compose it, and what its role is in the functions of your brain."}, {"url": "http://biology.about.com/od/anatomy/p/Brainstem.htm", "passage_text": "Brainstem: The brainstem is the region of the brain that connects the cerebrum with the spinal cord. It consists of the midbrain, medulla oblongata, and the pons. Motor and sensory neurons travel through the brainstem allowing for the relay of signals between the brain and the spinal cord. The brainstem coordinates motor control signals sent from the brain to the body."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-the-functions-of-the-midbrain.htm", "passage_text": "The midbrain region is part of the central nervous system. It is located near the center of the brain, under the cerebral cortex and on top of the hindbrain region. This region joins the spinal cord and the brain together and is commonly referred to as part of the brainstem primarily due to its location."}, {"url": "http://www.csuchico.edu/~pmccaffrey/syllabi/CMSD%20320/362unit6.html", "passage_text": "The pons, which is also part of the brain stem, is inferior to the midbrain and superior to the medulla. Its posterior border is separated from the cerebellum by the aqueduct of Sylvius, and more inferiorly, by the fourth ventricle. Motor and sensory tracts traverse the anterior surface of the pons."}]
