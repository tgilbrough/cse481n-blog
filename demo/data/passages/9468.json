In some cases, ablation prevents abnormal electrical signals from traveling through your heart and, thus, stops the arrhythmia. Cardiac ablation is sometimes done through open-heart surgery, but it's often done using catheters, making the procedure less invasive and shortening recovery times. 1  Why it's done."}, {"url": "http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/gynecology/endometrial_ablation_92,P07774/", "passage_text": "Endometrial ablation is a procedure to permanently remove a thin tissue layer of the lining of the uterus to stop or reduce excessive or abnormal bleeding in women for whom childbearing is complete.
