PETG offers the capability to produce complex shapes, precise details, deep draws and compound curves without worrying about durability. It's easily formed, die-cut and punched. PETG sheet has high stiffness, hardness, and toughness as well as good impact strength. Unstressed PETG exhibits good resistance to dilute aqueous solutions of mineral acids, bases, salts, and soaps. PETG also has good resistance to aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, and a variety of oils."}, {"url": "http://petg-rods-tubes.com/", "passage_text": "PETG Tubes and Rods have excellent bondability and machines easier than acrylics.

Polycarbonate is branded under the familiar name of Lexan and is often extruded into tubes, rods and other profiles. While polycarbonate tubes are used in a wide variety of applications, there is another option that is often overlooked: PETG Tubes. PETG, like polycarbonate, is a thermoplastic or polymer that turns to liquid when heated and hardens to a very glassy state when cooled. PETG (polyethylene terephthalate glycol) shares many characteristics with polycarbonate. Both are highly impact resistant, possess excellent clarity"}, {"url": "http://www.polymerplastics.com/transparents_petg.shtml", "passage_text": "PETG, glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate, is a copolyester that is a clear amorphous thermoplastic.

PET, PETE, PETG) is a plastic resin of the polyester family that is used to make beverage, food and other liquid containers, as well as for some other thermoforming applications. PETG is a clear amorphous thermoplastic that can be injection molded or sheet extruded. It can be colored during processing. PETG can be semi-rigid to rigid, depending on its thickness, and it is very lightweight. The main virtue of PETG is that it is fully recyclable. Unlike other plastics, its polymer chains can be recovered for additional useIt makes a good gas and fair moisture barrier, as well as a good barrier to alcohol and solvents."}]
