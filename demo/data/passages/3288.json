Clams, mussels, oysters and scallops are all bivalves. There are about 15,000 known species of bivalve, with about 80% of them being marine (the rest are found in fresh water). In general, mollusks have 3 body regions: a head, a visceral mass, and a foot.. The head contains the sense organs and brain, while the visceral mass contains the internal organs. The foot is the muscular lower part of the body which is in contact with the substrate."}, {"url": "http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/geography-environment/freshwater-mollusks", "passage_text": "The freshwater molluscan fauna of Georgia is one of the most diverse and abundant found anywhere in the world.

Although one might not see an obvious physical relationship between a snail and a squid, they are remarkably similar in construction.
