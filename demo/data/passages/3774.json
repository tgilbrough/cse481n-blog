From what we can tell, EVA foam \u2013 not standard EVA sheet material \u2013 is the source of concern because formamide is sometimes used to make the foam more pliable. Please note that I said sometimes. It\u2019s possible to locate formamide-free EVA foam, although many manufacturers don\u2019t routinely check (or test) for it yet. We recently investigated a new product to stock in our store and the manufacturer was able to confirm with their factory that a small amount of formamide was present in their products. It was noted though, that new mats have the highest risk and formamide residue decreases over time, so older products may contain little or no formamide.
