The thin structure that surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell is called as cell membrane. This is present in most plant, animal and fungi cells. It is a selectively permeable stru \u2026 cture and allows the flow of ions and particles from the inside of the cell to the outside and vice-versa."}, {"url": "http://preuniversity.grkraj.org/html/1_CELL_STRUCTURE.htm", "passage_text": "The following structures are found in the cell, 1) Cell wall, 2) Plasma membrane, 3) Nucleus, 4) Plastids, 5) Mitochondria, 6) Golgi complex, 7) Ribosomes, 8) Cytoskeleton, 9) Micro bodies, 10) Centrosomes,11) endoplasmic reticulum, 12) central vacuole and 13) Non living cell inclusions. This is the outer most membrane of the cell, within which all protoplasmic structures are included. In plants, cell wall acts as an additional protective layer, but in animal cell, plasma membrane itself is the bounding membrane."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)", "passage_text": "1 Some eukaryotic cells (plant cells and fungal cells) also have a cell wall. 2  Inside the cell is the cytoplasmic region that contains the genome (DNA), ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions. 3  The genetic material is freely found in the cytoplasm. Cells are the smallest unit of life that can replicate independently, and are often called the building blocks of life. The study of cells is called cell biology. Cells consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_structures_are_found_in_every_living_Cell", "passage_text": "The thin structure that surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell is called as cell membrane.

The cell membrane is sometimes also referred to as the plasma membrane. If the DNA within a cell is not separated from the cytoplasm, then that cell is a prokaryote. All known prokaryotes, such as bacteria and archaea, are single cells. In contrast, if the DNA is partitioned off in its own membrane-bound room called the nucleus, then that cell is a eukaryote."}, {"url": "http://www.cod.edu/people/faculty/fancher/cellstructure.htm", "passage_text": "1 , which serves as a diffusion barrier between the cell and its environment. 2  All living cells have plasma membranes. 3  A diffusion barrier prevents the loss of cellular materials by interfering with the physical tendency of molecules to spread out. Eukaryotic cells, while very similar in function to prokaryotic cells, are much larger and more complex. They are typically characterized by the presense of a prominent, more or less central nucleus. Viewed through a light microscope, this nucleus is by far the most striking visible feature of the cell."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_structures_are_found_in_every_living_Cell", "passage_text": "All cells have a cell membrane and the cytoplasm (liquid medium).
