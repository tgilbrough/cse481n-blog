The concept of the use of push-buttons in telephony originated around 1887 with a device called the micro-telephone push-button, but it was not an automatic dialing system as understood later. This use even predated the invention of the rotary dial by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891."}, {"url": "http://www.ithappenedinthe60s.com/posts/november-18-1963-introduction-of-the-push-button-telephone/", "passage_text": "By Carl Stieren.

Touch-tone technology primarily used a keypad in form of a rectangular array of push-buttons for dialing. Older Australian rotary dial telephones also had letters, but the combinations were often printed in the center plate adjacent to the number. The Australian letter to number mapping was: A=1, B=2, F=3, J=4, L=5, M=6, U=7, W=8, X=9, Y=0, so the phone number BX 3701 was in fact 29 3701."}, {"url": "http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2009-04-28/cheng-payphones.html", "passage_text": "There were no drugs; as it turned out; the kid had never seen a rotary dial before. The first public coin telephone was installed in 1889 at a bank in Hartford, Conn. By 1902, there were 81,000 pay phones in the U.S. and by 1960, Bell System had installed its millionth pay phone.

In my freshman dorm, I had a party line\u2014one number shared by students in four rooms. Incoming calls could be for any of the students; whoever answered the phone would have to track down the person it was for and announce he had a call. The strongest memories I have about rotary phones are more about the way we used and thought of phones in the fifties, sixties, and seventies. We had a phone-culture that truly bears little relation to what a smart phone and modern phone technology offers."}]
