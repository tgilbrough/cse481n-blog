It is one of the most common gases in the universe, as well as on Earth. While it is valued for its energy-production capabilities, methane also has the ability to potentially wreak havoc on the Earth's fragile ecosystems. In addition to natural gas-fired electrical generation stations, there are other uses for methane as an energy source as well. It is currently being used to power some automobiles and NASA is considering its use as a fuel for space vehicles."}]
