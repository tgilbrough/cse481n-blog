In active transport particles move against a concentration gradient and therefore require energy which must be supplied by the cell. Carrier proteins that are found in the cell membrane of cells use energy to transport molecules or ions across the membrane, against the concentration gradient."}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_ocr_gateway/green_world/plantmineralsrev3.shtml", "passage_text": "Instead, active transport is used.
