To investigate the influence of furosemide plasma protein binding on its kinetics and dynamics, the kinetics of furosemide was studied in the presence of a protein binding displacer, warfarin, and in hypoalbuminemic rabbits.

The duration of diuretic action is 2 and 6 hr after IV and PO administration, respectively. Furosemide is highly protein bound (91%\u201397%), almost totally to albumin. It is cleared through the kidneys by renal tubular secretion. Bioavailability of oral furosemide is low (only 50% is absorbed). Furosemide is usually dosed to effect.
