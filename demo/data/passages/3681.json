The double helix is antiparallel, meaning each strand runs in a different direction. The first step to DNA replication is the unwinding of the double helix with the help of an enyme called helicase. Once unwound, the DNA unzips and the bonded nucleotides are separated. In the next stage, an enzyme called DNA polymerase is important.

Cellular proofreading and error-checking mechanisms ensure near perfect fidelity for DNA replication. DNA usually exists as a double-stranded structure, with both strands coiled together to form the characteristic double-helix. Each single strand of DNA is a chain of four types of nucleotides.

Best Answer: The most widespread example of DNA replication in the real world is your zipper. It divides into two strands on unwinding and forms replication fork just like DNA does. And the same unwinded strands can be incorporated into the daughter DNA molecules and thus becomes semiconservative in nature. Source(s): .

Explain your answer. Lagging strand synthesis is more complex because of the requirement for DNA replication to take place in the 5' to 3' direction. Since parent strands are oriented in an anti-parallel fashion, one strand is oriented in the 5' to 3' direction, while the other strand is oriented in the 3' to 5' direction. While DNA replication does occur in the 5' to 3' direction, the reason is not because 3' to 5' replication is chemically impossible. 3' to 5' replication can in principle occur. The 3' OH of the incoming nucleotide instead of the nucleotide attached to the end of the growing chain would be the attacking group."}]
