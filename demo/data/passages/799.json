[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_projection", "passage_text": "Axonometric projection is a type of parallel projection used to create a pictorial drawing of an object, where the object is rotated along one or more of its axes relative to the plane of projection. There are three main types of axonometric projection: isometric, dimetric, and trimetric projection. Graphical projection is a protocol, used in technical drawing, by which an image of a three-dimensional object is projected onto a planar surface without the aid of numerical calculation. 1  1 Overview."}, {"url": "http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Pictorial+drawing", "passage_text": "Pictorial drawing. A view of an object (actual or imagined) as it would be seen by an observer who looks at the object either in a chosen direction or from a selected point of view. Pictorial sketches often are more readily made and more clearly understood than are front, top, and side views of an object. 1). Oblique pictorial drawings, while not true orthographic views, offer a convenient method for drawing circles and other curves in their true shape (Fig. 2). In order to reduce the distortion in an oblique drawing, measurements along the receding axis may be foreshortened."}, {"url": "http://www.tasstudent.com/pictorial-drawing/", "passage_text": "Tasstudent.com. A Pictorial drawing provides a 3D image to help understand the shape of an object or to assist in interpreting a drawing. There are 3 main ways to draw a pictorial drawing, 1. Isometric, 2. Oblique, 3. Perspective. An Isometric drawing is a way of presenting designs in three dimensions (3D). They can be completed using the 30/60 set square or freehand. An Isometric drawing is one of a family of three-dimensional views called pictorial drawings."}, {"url": "http://www.tasstudent.com/pictorial-drawing/", "passage_text": "Perspective drawings. A Perspective drawing. is one of the best types of drawings to use to provide a pictorial representation of an object. They produce an image of an object in three dimensions that is very similar to what the human eye sees. An Isometric drawing is a way of presenting designs in three dimensions (3D). They can be completed using the 30/60 set square or freehand. An Isometric drawing is one of a family of three-dimensional views called pictorial drawings."}, {"url": "http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Pictorial+drawing", "passage_text": "See Engineering drawing. In making a pictorial drawing, the viewing direction that shows the object and its details to the best advantage is chosen. The resultant drawing is orthographic if the viewing rays are considered as parallel, or perspective if the rays are considered as meeting at the eye of the observer. 1). Oblique pictorial drawings, while not true orthographic views, offer a convenient method for drawing circles and other curves in their true shape (Fig. 2). In order to reduce the distortion in an oblique drawing, measurements along the receding axis may be foreshortened."}, {"url": "http://www.tasstudent.com/pictorial-drawing/", "passage_text": "Isometric drawing is the most commonly used method of pictorial drawing. Isometric drawings are built on three lines, called isometric axes. One is drawn vertically and the other two with the 30\u00b0 set square either side of it.
