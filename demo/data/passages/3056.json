At the speed of 100,000 km/hour, you would reach Neptune in 5.12 years. so it ''could'' take about 2 years if you travel at a greater speed. It could also take 12 years if you travel at a slower speed. 12 years to travel to Neptune not 5.12 or 130 days. it took voyager 2 twelve years to travel to Neptune. But, he did stop at other planets along the way. By travelling at 40,000km/ph you would get there in 12 years."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_long_would_it_take_to_get_to_Neptune_by_rocket_from_Earth", "passage_text": "It would depend on the path chosen and on where Neptune and Earth were in their orbits.

However nuclear fusion, such as the Orion project, it can theoretically reach speeds of 8-10% the speed of light."}, {"url": "https://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090313160151AAfZLHv", "passage_text": "Best Answer: The minimum distance from Earth to Neptune is 4.3 billion km or 2.68 billion miles. I think the first answerer made a calculation error. With the speed of sound being 1230 kilometers per hour (343 m/s), I get 33.88 years to Neptune at the speed of sound."}]
