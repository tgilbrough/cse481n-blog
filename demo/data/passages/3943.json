Fruits and vegetables are not good sources, because the zinc in plant proteins is not as available for use by the body as the zinc from animal proteins. Therefore, low-protein diets and vegetarian diets tend to be low in zinc. Zinc is in most multivitamin and mineral supplements."}, {"url": "http://www.badgerbalm.com/s-33-zinc-oxide-sunscreen-nanoparticles.aspx", "passage_text": "Zinc oxide is the metal zinc that has been oxidized. The chemical formula is ZnO, 1 zinc atom and 1 oxygen atom held together by an ionic bond.
