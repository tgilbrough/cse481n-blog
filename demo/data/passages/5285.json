Anyone who is not achieving the critical blood oxygen saturation level of 90% (SpO 2) or of 55-60mmHg (SaO 2), may require additional oxygen. "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation_in_medicine", "passage_text": "Oxygen saturation is a term referring to the fraction of oxygen-saturated hemoglobin relative to total hemoglobin (unsaturated + saturated) in the blood. The human body requires and regulates a very precise and specific balance of oxygen in the blood. Normal blood oxygen levels in humans are considered 95-100 percent. An SaO 2 (arterial oxygen saturation) value below 90% causes hypoxemia (which can also be caused by anemia). Hypoxemia due to low SaO is indicated by cyanosis. Oxygen saturation can be measured in different tissues: 1  Venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2) is measured to see how much oxygen the body consumes."}, {"url": "http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/hypoxemia/basics/definition/SYM-20050930", "passage_text": "Though the pulse oximeter actually measures the saturation of oxygen in your blood, the results are often used as an estimate of blood oxygen levels. Normal pulse oximeter readings range from 95 to 100 percent, under most circumstances. Values under 90 percent are considered low. 1  Causes. Hypoxemia, or low blood oxygen, describes a lower than normal level of oxygen in your blood. In order to function properly, your body needs a certain level of oxygen circulating in the blood to cells and tissues."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation_in_medicine", "passage_text": "1 Venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2) is measured to see how much oxygen the body consumes. 2  Under clinical treatment, a SvO 2 below 60% indicates that the body is in lack of oxygen, and ischemic diseases occur. An SaO 2 (arterial oxygen saturation) value below 90% causes hypoxemia (which can also be caused by anemia). Hypoxemia due to low SaO is indicated by cyanosis.

A pulse oximeter uses light to measure the oxygen saturation level, the percentage of hemoglobin in your red blood cells carrying oxygen. Normal oxygen saturation levels fall between 95 and 99 percent. If you're in good health, normal blood oxygen levels almost always fall within a very predictable range. Medical professionals use two primary measurements for determining your blood oxygen level: oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen."}, {"url": "http://www.3fatchicks.com/what-is-a-normal-resting-blood-oxygen-level/", "passage_text": "Normal Blood Oxygen Levels. Healthy people have a normal range of oxygen saturation from 95% \u2013 100%, although levels down to 90% are common and not usually cause for alarm. During exercise, the increased oxygen consumption may reduce blood saturation, but the increased breathing rate and blood flow compensate for this. Because hemoglobin saturated with CO (carbon monoxide) can not be differentiated from that with oxygen, a pulse oximetry test may indicate the blood level is normal, when in fact the oxygen levels are low."}, {"url": "http://www.favoriteplus.com/oxygen-saturation.php", "passage_text": "Basically, a saturation of 97% of the total amount of hemoglobin in the body is filled with oxygen molecules. A range of 96% to 100% is generally considered normal. Anything below 90% could quickly lead to life-threatening complications. The margin between healthy saturation levels (95-98%) and respiratory failure (usually 85-90%) is narrow."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_normal_oxygen_saturation", "passage_text": "The Harvard link I've provided explains that blood oxygen saturation levels are normal at 95%-100%.

Oxygen saturation level in healthy patients is considered normal between 97 percent and 99 percent. Patients who have normal hemoglobin levels can have a saturation level of 95. When the amount of oxygen in the blood is reduced, a condition known as hypoxemia results, and treatment is then required. Oxygen saturation refers to the level of oxygen carried by red blood cells through the arteries and delivered to internal organs. As red blood cells travel through the lungs, they are saturated with oxygen. A low saturation level could indicate a respiratory illness or other medical condition."}]
