Nucleolus is also referred to as nucleole, which means, a cellular structure found in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. What is the Nucleolus of a Cell. Both animal and plant cells contains a nucleolus. As aforementioned, the nucleolus is a cellular structure present in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. In cell biology, the nucleolus is defined as a sub-organelle of the nucleus of a cell (which itself is an organelle). It is a round and typically, a small granular structured body which is composed of RNA and protein substances in the cell's nucleus.

The nucleolus makes ribosomal subunits from proteins and ribosomal RNA, also known as rRNA. It then sends the subunits out to the rest of the cell where they combine into complete ribosomes. Ribosomes make proteins; therefore, the nucleolus plays a vital role in making proteins in the cell."}, {"url": "http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/nucleus/nucleolus.html", "passage_text": "The Nucleolus. The nucleolus is a prominent sub-nuclear structure that is not bound by a membrane and resides within the nuclear matrix. Though known to exist since the eighteenth century, the primary function of the nucleolus was not discovered until the 1960s.
