It also makes them useful for enzymes, because without enzymes you wouldn't be reading this text, and I would never have written it, they make chemical reactions possible at temperatures that in the lab simply are not possible.

In animals, the structurally similar glucose polymer is the more densely branched glycogen, sometimes called 'animal starch'. Examples include storage polysaccharides such as starch and glycogen, and structural polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitin.
