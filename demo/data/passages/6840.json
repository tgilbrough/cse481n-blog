Longshore drift is the name given to the process by which beach material is transported along the coast by the action of waves. Waves rarely hit the beach at exactly right angles to the coast, and are far more likely to hit the beach at an angle."}, {"url": "http://www.onegeology.org/eXtra/kids/earthProcesses/longshoreDrift.html", "passage_text": "Longshore drift. Waves that hit the beach at an angle carry sand and gravel up the beach face at an angle. When the water washes back the sediment is carried straight back down the beach face. Individual particles are moved along the beach in a zig zag pattern. This is called longshore drift.

This process occurs in the littoral zone, and in or close to the surf zone."}]
