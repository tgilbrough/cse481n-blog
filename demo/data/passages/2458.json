The core accretion model describes how the rocky inner planets formed from Sol's protoplanetary disk. The larger terrestrial planets, Earth and Venus, probably needed tens of millions of years to grow to their current size through collisions with large planetary embryos of 1,000 to 5,000 kilometers (620 to 3,100 miles)."}, {"url": "http://kids.nineplanets.org/general.htm", "passage_text": "ROCKY PLANETS (Mercury-Venus-Earth-Mars-Pluto).
