There is concern amongst critics that it will not always be possible to examine the hardware components on which Trusted Computing relies, the Trusted Platform Module, which is the ultimate hardware system where the core 'root' of trust in the platform has to reside."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_a_TPM_chip", "passage_text": "Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip designed by the TCG (Trusted Computing Group), it stores passwords, encryption keys and digital certificates. Pros: -Provides added security in case your laptop got lost or stolen, the above average joe won't be able to get into it.

Each TPM chip contains an RSA key pair called the Endorsement Key (EK). The pair is maintained inside the chip and cannot be accessed by software.
