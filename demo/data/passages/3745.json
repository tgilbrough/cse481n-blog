[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet", "passage_text": "An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. Electromagnets usually consist of a large number of closely spaced turns of wire that create the magnetic field. The magnetic field created by an electromagnet is proportional to both the number of turns in the winding, N, and the current in the wire, I, hence this product, NI, in ampere-turns, is given the name magnetomotive force."}, {"url": "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/electromagnetism", "passage_text": "Medical Definition of ELECTROMAGNETISM. 1. : magnetism developed by a current of electricity.
