Anemia occurs when the body has a below normal amount of red blood cells. This causes a hematocrit levels fall below normal. Malnutrition or nutritional deficiencies of certain vitamins or minerals can lead to anemia and produce low HCT blood test results. The value measures what percentage of red blood cells a blood sample contains. For example, a hematocrit 47% means that for every 100 mL of blood, 47 mL are red blood cells. The normal range for a male is between 40.7% and 50.3%.
