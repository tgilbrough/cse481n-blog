Hekla is the most active volcano in Iceland, and one of the world's best known volcanoes. Hekla volcano, Iceland-John Seach. The structure of Hekla is considered intermediate between crater row of Laki-type, and stratovolcano of the Vesuvius-type. It is built on a 5 km long fissure. Repose periods at the volcano have lasted from 10 to 102 years. A 6.6-km-long fissure opened along the length of Hekla volcano from the SW to the NE, south of the summit area. A Subplinian eruption plume reached a height of 12 km in 32 minutes. This was accompanied by several small pyroclastic flows."}]
