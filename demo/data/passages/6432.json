But when really pressed for a dollar figure, she said between $100 and $150 per person is appropriate. Wedding planner Lynzie Kent says a general rule is to give a gift that at least covers the cost of your reception dinner. It used to be $100 a head is kind of the going rate, but these days I think it's anywhere between $150 and $250 per person, Kent told CTVNews.ca."}, {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/wedding-gift-giving-tips/", "passage_text": "Gifts-The Wedding Channel suggests that the average amount for an engagement gift is $35, while the average amount for a shower gift is $25.
