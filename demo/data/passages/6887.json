A fetus (baby) is fed, or nourished, by the mother through the placenta, which is attached to the umbilical cord. In the placenta, the mother's blood and the fetal blood both flow through vessels that are very close together. But the mother's blood does not mix with the fetal blood. When the mother's blood is close to the fetal blood, oxygen and nutrients move from the mother's blood into the fetal blood. As the blood flows through the fetus, it picks up waste products and returns to the mother through the umbilical cord.

It allows blood to flow from mother to baby, and back again. The mother\u2019s blood and the baby\u2019s blood are filtered through the placenta, but they never actually mix. The placenta\u2019s primary jobs are to: 1  move oxygen into the baby\u2019s bloodstream.

Through the blood vessels in the umbilical cord, the fetus receives all the necessary nutrition, oxygen, and life support from the mother through the placenta. Waste products and carbon dioxide from the fetus are sent back through the umbilical cord and placenta to the mother's circulation to be eliminated. It moves blood from the right atrium of the heart to the left atrium. The ductus arteriosus moves blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. Oxygen and nutrients from the mother's blood are transferred across the placenta to the fetus. The enriched blood flows through the umbilical cord to the liver and splits into three branches.

The baby growing inside of the mother's uterus (the womb) is called a fetus. The growing fetus is fully dependent on a special organ called the placenta for nourishment.
