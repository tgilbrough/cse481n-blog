Old World monkeys are native to Africa and Asia, and include familiar species such as the langur, the macaque, and the baboon. New World Monkeys, which are native to Central and South America, include marmosets, capuchins, and wooly monkeys. New World monkeys are thought to have evolved from Old World monkeys after migrating from Africa to South America on a raft of vegetation during the Oligocene period, some 23 million to 34 million years ago.

As one of our closest relatives, these mammals are very intelligent and have opposable thumbs, allowing them to use tools and play games. There are more than 260 different types of monkeys. Monkeys are as varied in shape and size as humans. The world's smallest monkey is the pygmy marmoset, according to the University of Wisconsin.
