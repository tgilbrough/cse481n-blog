Acetate ismanufactured by treating purified cellulose refined from cotton linters and/or wood pulp with acetic anhydride in the presence of a catalyst. The cellulose acetate fibers are intermingled and wound onto a bobbin or shippable metier cheese package, ready for use without further chemical processing. In the manufacture of staple fiber, the filaments from numerous spinnerets are combined into tow form, crimped, cut to the required length, and packaged in bales."}, {"url": "http://www.apparelsearch.com/definitions/fiber/acetate_definition.htm", "passage_text": "Cellulose acetate or acetate rayon fiber (1924) is one of the earliest synthetic fibers and is based on cotton or tree pulp cellulose (biopolymers).

Traces of natural fibres have been located to ancient civilizations all over the gobe. For many thousand years, the usage of fiber was limited by natural fibres such as flax, cotton, silk, wool and plant fibres for different applications. Fibers can be divided into natural fibres and man-made or chemical fibres."}, {"url": "http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Acetate+Fibers", "passage_text": "Acetate fibers are molded from solutions of cellulose acetate in organic solvents (triacetate cellulose in a mixture of methylene chloride and alcohol, secondary cellulose acetate in acetone), usually by the so-called dry method. By this method filaments, the so-called acetate silk, are obtained. Later acetate fiber production decreased after the appearance of new types of valuable synthetic fibers. In 1967 the world output of acetate fibers was 397,000 tons, 6.4 percent of the total production of chemical fibers. Rogovin, Z. A.
