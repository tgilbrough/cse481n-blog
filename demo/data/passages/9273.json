DNA is the molecule that is the hereditary material in all living cells. Genes are made of DNA, and so is the genome itself. A gene consists of enough DNA to code for one protein, and a genome is simply the sum total of an organism's DNA. DNA is long and skinny, capable of contorting like a circus performer when it winds into chromosomes. DNA is a very large molecule, made up of smaller units called nucleotides that are strung together in a row, making a DNA molecule thousands of times longer than it is wide. Each nucleotide has three parts: a sugar molecule, a phosphate molecule, and a structure called a nitrogenous base"}, {"url": "http://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html", "passage_text": "DNA structure. DNA is made up of molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a phosphate group, a sugar group and a nitrogen base. The four types of nitrogen bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C).
