A plant leaf is lined with two layers of epidermis (i.e. upper and lower): one on top of and another one below the mesophyll layer. The epidermis is a protective outer covering of many plants and animals. It may be comprised of a single layer, as in plants, or of several layers of cells on top of the dermis, as in those of vertebrate animals. The primary role of the epidermis is to protect the more susceptible layers of the skin."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/upper-epidermis-of-a-leaf-function-definition-quiz.html", "passage_text": "Lesson Summary.
