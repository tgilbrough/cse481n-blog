In some areas, such as portions of what-is-now the eastern United States, coal was formed from swamps covered by sea water. In fact, most of the fossil fuels we find today were formed millions of years before the first dinosaurs. Formation of Coal.

It is formed from the remains of decayed plant material compacted into a solid through millions of years of chemical changes under pressure and heat. As the organic maturity process continues, the buried plant material is transformed into different types of coal. Coal has been consumed as an energy source for hundreds of years. It provided the energy that boosted the industrial revolution of the 19th century and launched the electric era in the following century. It was the world's most important source of primary energy until the late 1960s when it was overtaken by oil."}, {"url": "http://geology.about.com/od/mineral_resources/a/aa_nutshellcoal.htm", "passage_text": "Coal, the Organic Rock. Coal differs from every other kind of rock in that it is made of organic carbon: the actual remains, not just mineralized fossils, of dead plants. Today the vast majority of dead plant matter is consumed by fire and decay, returning its carbon to the atmosphere as the gas carbon dioxide\u2014it is oxidized. First the swampy peat is squeezed and heated to form a brown, soft coal called lignite. In the process, the material releases hydrocarbons, which migrate away and eventually become petroleum. With more heat and pressure lignite releases more hydrocarbons and becomes the higher-grade bituminous coal."}]
