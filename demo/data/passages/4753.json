Iron(II) hydroxide or ferrous hydroxide is a compound with the formula Fe(OH) 2. It is produced when iron(II) ions, from a compound such as iron(II) sulfate, react with hydroxide ions.

As the mineral known as hematite, Fe 2 O 3 is the main source of iron for the steel industry. Iron(III) oxide is a product of the oxidation of iron.

Usually there is a difference between water soluble Fe 2+ compounds and generally water insoluble Fe 3+ compounds. The latter are only water soluble in strongly acidic solutions, but water solubility increases when these are reduced to Fe 2+ under certain conditions. Usually the oxide layer does not protect iron from further corrosion, but is removed so more metal oxides can be formed. Electrolytes are mostly iron (II) sulphate, which forms during corrosion by atmospheric SO 2. In sea regions atmospheric salt particles may play an important role in this process."}]
