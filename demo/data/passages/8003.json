Hypovolemia is a condition, where the blood volume decreases, otherwise decrease in blood plasma volume occurs. Thus, it is the volume contraction\u2019s intravascular component, or blood volume loss due to hemorrhage and dehydration. Hence, sometimes, volume contraction and hypovolemia are used synonymously. Hypovolemia is represented by depletion of sodium (salt), thereby differing from dehydration, and meaning excessive water loss from the body. Historically, hypovolemia was termed desanguination meaning extensive loss of blood (derived from the Latin word sanguis, meaning blood). Hippocrates widely used this term."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovolemia", "passage_text": "Common causes of hypovolemia are. 1  Loss of blood (external or internal bleeding or blood donation). 2  Loss of plasma (severe burns and lesions discharging fluid). 3  Loss of body sodium and consequent intravascular water; e.g. diarrhea or vomiting. Hypovolemia can be recognized by tachycardia, diminished blood pressure, and the absence of perfusion as assessed by skin signs (skin turning pale) and/or capillary refill on forehead, lips and nail beds. The patient may feel dizzy, faint, nauseated, or very thirsty."}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/hypovolemic-shock", "passage_text": "Hypovolemic shock, also known as hemorrhagic shock, is a life-threatening condition that results when you lose more than 20 percent (one-fifth) of your body\u2019s blood or fluid supply. This severe fluid loss makes it impossible for the heart to pump a sufficient amount of blood to your body. Hypovolemic shock results from significant and sudden blood or fluid losses within your body. Blood loss of this magnitude can occur because of: 1  bleeding from cuts or wounds. 2  bleeding from blunt traumatic injuries due to accidents or seizure activity."}, {"url": "http://www.ehealthstar.com/hypovolemia", "passage_text": "Hypovolemia means any decrease in the blood volume and does not already mean hypovolemic shock. For example, donation of 500 mL blood causes hypovolemia, but usually not shock 12. Hypovolemic shock may start to develop at 10-20% blood loss (0.5-1 liter blood) because of inadequate perfusion of the body tissues.

Blood loss can result from external injuries, internal bleeding, or certain obstetric emergencies. Diarrhea and vomiting are common causes of body fluid loss. Fluid can also be lost as a result of large burns, excessive perspiration, or diuretics. Inadequate fluid intake can also cause hypovolemia."}]
