Its lateral border is convex while its medial border is concave. The medial concavity is the point at which the renal neurovascular structures enter and leave the kidneys. These organs accomplish their excretory role by converting nitrogenous waste to urine. It is also an integral part of water and pH homeostasis, blood pressure regulation and red blood cell regulation. The calyces act as conduits for urine to leave the medulla and enter the ureters. There are minor calyces and major calyces. Each minor calyx is a funnel shaped structures that surrounds a renal papilla and collects urine from it through the area cribrosa (sieve-like apparatus)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilum_of_kidney", "passage_text": "(Redirected from Hilum of kidney).
