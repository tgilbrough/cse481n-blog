[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste", "passage_text": "Taste, gustatory perception, or gustation is the sensory impression of food or other substances on the tongue and is one of the five traditional senses. Taste is the sensation produced when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells. The sensation of taste can be categorized into five basic tastes: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, and umami. Taste buds are able to differentiate among different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions."}, {"url": "http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/tasty.html", "passage_text": "The Taste Bud Image from Biodidac There are two cranial nerves that innervate the tongue and are used for taste: the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) and the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX). The cranial nerves carry taste information into the brain to a part of the brain stem called the nucleus of the solitary tract. From the nucleus of the solitary tract, taste information goes to the thalamus and then to the cerebral cortex."}, {"url": "https://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070416175656AA6Ihv1", "passage_text": "The facial nerve innervates the anterior (front) two-thirds of the tongue and the glossopharyngeal nerve innervates that posterior (back) one-third part of the tongue.
