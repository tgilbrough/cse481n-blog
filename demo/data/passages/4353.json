[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect", "passage_text": "Congenital heart defect (CHD), also known as a congenital heart anomaly or congenital heart disease, is a problem in the structure of the heart that is present at birth. Signs and symptoms depend on the specific type of problem. Most of the known causes of congenital heart disease are sporadic genetic changes, either focal mutations or deletion or addition of segments of DNA. Large chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomies 21, 13, and 18 cause about 5\u20138% of cases of CHD, with trisomy 21 being the most common genetic cause."}, {"url": "http://www.cdc.gov/genomics/resources/diseases/heart.htm", "passage_text": "In the future, genetic testing to determine personal risk estimates for heart disease may also prove useful, but this approach has not yet been scientifically validated. The chance of developing heart disease can be reduced by taking steps to prevent and control factors that put people at greater risk. Such histories can capture the effects and interactions of shared genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors that lead to disease in a family. Several genetic disorders are associated with increased risk of premature heart attacks."}, {"url": "http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/critical-congenital-heart-disease", "passage_text": "Critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) is a term that refers to a group of serious heart defects that are present from birth.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death and a major cause of disability in the United States. More than 600,000 Americans die of heart disease annually.

There are different types of inherited heart diseases. Identifying these conditions early can lead to better care and improved health over time. 1  Cardiomyopathies are diseases that affect the physical structure of the heart and interfere with its ability to pump blood. 1 Arrhythmias are diseases that affect the heart's electrical system and the heart's ability to properly squeeze and relax. 2  Hereditary arrhythmias can result in a heartbeat that is too fast, too slow or irregular. 3  They can lead to rapid heartbeat, lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting and sometimes sudden death."}, {"url": "http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/heart_vascular_institute/clinical_services/specialty_areas/center_inherited_heart_diseases.html", "passage_text": "Center for Inherited Heart Diseases.

Heart disease is often a family matter. There are certain features of a family history that may be signs of a genetic heart disorder. Some of these include: 1  Sudden cardiac death, unexplained death at a young age, or death by an unexplained accident or drowning. 2  Heart failure at a young age (under 50). Genetic Testing. Genes are what make you similar to your family. Problems in genes can cause diseases that multiple people in a family can develop. Since heart disease can be a genetic disorder, if heart problems run in your family, genetic testing can be done to see if you carry a gene for a specific disorder."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20070718/6-heart-disease-genes-found", "passage_text": "Heart Disease Genetics. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for U.S. men and women. Heart disease risk may be handed down from generation to generation through genes. But genetics are only part of the story.
