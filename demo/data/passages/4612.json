The maximum SSI benefit is $698 per month, as of 2012. If you have unearned income, it will reduce the benefit dollar for dollar, after the first $20. So unearned income of $718 will eliminate one month's benefit. If you have earned income, the first $65 is ignored. After that, the benefit is reduced by 50 percent of your earnings. For example, if you earn $685 in a month, the first $85 is ignored. Then your benefits are reduced by 50 percent of the remaining $600, to $398.
