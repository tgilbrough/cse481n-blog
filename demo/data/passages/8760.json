The Ostwald process is a chemical process that in two stages, converts ammonia to nitric acid (also known as HNO3). In the process for step 1, ammonia is oxidized to form nitric oxide and also nitrogen dioxide. Then in step 2, the nitrogen dioxide that was formed is absorbed in water. This in-turn forms nitric acid(www.pem-news.de, n.d.).The Ostwald process has many well-known uses in both the industrial and health field."}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/standard/chemistry/plasticsandothermaterials/fertilisers/revision/7/", "passage_text": "Ostwald Process-oxidation of ammonia.

Nitric acid (HNO 3) is an extremely important chemical used in the manufacture of fertilisers and explosives. It is made from ammonia by the Ostwald Process (developed in 1902 by the German chemist Wilhelm Ostwald, who got the Nobel prize in 1909). This process reacts together O 2 and NH 3 at 850\u00b0C and 5 atmospheres pressure, with the help of Platinum and Rhodium catalysts, to make NO."}, {"url": "http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/nitric/nitrich.htm", "passage_text": "Nitric acid (HNO 3) is an extremely important chemical used in the manufacture of fertilisers and explosives.
