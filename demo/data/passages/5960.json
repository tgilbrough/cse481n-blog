While the actin filaments in the ectoplasm facilitate movement of the cell in whole, the inner protein filaments help the organelles and other structures to move inside the cell. The internal organelles of the cell are suspended in the cytoplasm, which is a gelatinous fluid that fills the interior of the cell. Basically, there are two types of cells-eukaryotic and prokaryotic. The main difference between the two is that the latter ones lack nucleus and some other organelles."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_function_of_the_cytoplasm", "passage_text": "The cytoplasm consists of cytosol and the cellular organelles, except the nucleus. The cytosol is made up of water, salts and organic molecules and many enzymes that catalyze reactions. The cytoplasm plays an important role in a cell, serving as a molecular soup in which the organelles are suspended and held together by a fatty membrane. it holds all of the cell organelles, or stuff in the cell, together The cytoplasm acts like the cell s skeleton. it is a jelly like substance around nucleus The cytoplasms function in a plant cell is to help gel the parts of the cell in place but it is also where many of the cells chemical reactions happen."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_function_of_the_cytoplasm", "passage_text": "The cytoplasm is the cytosol and all the organelles (minus the nucleus) in the cell.

Cytoplasm holds the internal components of cells in place and protects them from damage. Cytoplasm stores molecules used for cellular processes, as well as hosts many of these processes within the cell itself. The cytoplasm also hosts a variety of cellular processes, such as glycolysis, which is the first step in cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is how your body makes energy from food. Cell division also occurs in the cytoplasm as well as the synthesis of polypeptides (the molecules that make up proteins)."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_function_of_the_cytoplasm", "passage_text": "The cytoplasm plays a mechanical role, i.e. (example) to maintain the shape, the consistency of the cell and to provide suspension to the organelles.
