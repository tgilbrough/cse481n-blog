Your muscles need oxygen to produce energy in a process called cellular respiration. The energy is used to fuel muscle contractions. Exercise increases your muscles' need for energy and thus more oxygen is delivered to your muscles. Once oxygen is delivered to your muscles, it doesn't leave your muscle cells but is converted to other molecules. Exercise. Exercise increases the work load of your muscles. This increases the energy need and ATP production rate in your muscle cells. Your breathing rate will increase when you exercise to ensure that enough oxygen is delivered to your muscles to keep up constant ATP production."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_waste_product", "passage_text": "Cellular waste products are formed as a by-product of cellular respiration, a series of processes and reactions that generate energy for the cell, in the form of ATP.

This is the process by which a cell uses oxygen to burn glucose and make ATP. There are 4 parts to this; 1  Glycolysis \u2013 Occurs in the cytoplasm This produces 4 ATP and 2 NADH, from Glucose (from sugar foods or carbohydrates) but uses 2 ATP to get there-so results in 2 ATP + 2 NADH and Pyruvate."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_waste_product", "passage_text": "Fermentation is another process by which cells can extract energy from glucose.

Recall that in cellular respiration the cell first breaks glucose into smaller molecules. This releases a small amount of energy. \u2022 Cells can release energy in two basic processes: cellular respiration and fermentation. Cellular respiration requires oxygen, while fermentation does not. In addition, cellular respiration releases much more usable energy than does fermentation.
