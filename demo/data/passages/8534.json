In the past, various systems of measurements were used. For example, length was measured in units like foot, yard, chain and mile. Weight was measured in units like pound, ounce, kati, tahil. Today, many countries in the world use the same units of measurements. We say that they use standard units. The standard units used are the S.I. units. Under this system of units, mass is measured in kilograms (kg) and length is measured in metres (m). The use of standard units makes it easier for people from different countries to communicate with each other."}, {"url": "http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/International-System-of-Units-SI", "passage_text": "The International System of Units (abbreviated SI from systeme internationale, the French version of the name) is a scientific method of expressing the magnitudes or quantities of important natural phenomena. There are seven base units in the system, from which other units are derived. The meter (abbreviation, m) is the SI unit of displacement or length.

The Metric System is a measurement system which uses Standard International (SI) Units. It is simple to learn and easy to use because of its decimal nature. Almost all of the countries in the world use the metric system although many products are still manufactured in common sizes for public use. The metric base unit for measuring mass is the Kilogram. When the Kilogram is divided by 1000 the result is 1 gram and when the Kilogram is multiplied by 1000 the result is 1 metric tonne. (Note the difference in spelling for tonne).
