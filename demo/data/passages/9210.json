The name endospore is suggestive of a spore or seed-like form (endo means within), but it is not a true spore (i.e., not an offspring). It is a stripped-down, dormant form to which the bacterium can reduce itself. Examples of bacteria that can form endospores include Bacillus and Clostridium. The endospore consists of the bacterium's DNA, ribosomes and large amounts of dipicolinic acid. Dipicolinic acid is a spore-specific chemical that appears to help in the ability for endospores to maintain dormancy."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_subtilis", "passage_text": "B. subtilis cells are typically rod-shaped, and are about 4-10 micrometers (\u03bcm) long and 0.25\u20131.0 \u03bcm in diameter, with a cell volume of about 4.6 fL at stationary phase. As other members of the genus Bacillus, it can form an endospore, to survive extreme environmental conditions of temperature and desiccation.

Bacillus anthracis is an important organism to study genome sequence because it's used as a biological weapon (1). Genome sequencing can also be useful for the development of vaccines. Bacillus anthracis is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium, 1 - 1.2\u00b5m in width and 3 - 5\u00b5m in length. It lives in soils worldwide at mesophilic temperatures (10).
