In this lab you will investigate the diversity of pterophytes, including whisk fens, horsetails and a variety of ferns. The plants on display are sporophytes, the dominant generation in seedless vascular plants. Procedure: 1. Examine a living whisk fern on display. This is one of only two extant genera of Psilophytes.

Living groups of nonvascular plants include the bryophytes: liverworts, hornworts, and mosses. Vascular plants are the more common plants like pines, ferns, corn, and oaks. The phylogenetic relationships within the plant kingdom are shown in Figure 1. The sporophyte phase produces spores by meiosis within a sporangium. The gametophyte phase produces gametes by mitosis within an antheridium (producing sperm) and/or archegonium (producing eggs). These different stages of the flowering plant life cycle are shown in Figure 4."}, {"url": "http://facultyweb.wcjc.edu/biology/BIOL1407/Lab%20Handouts/Lab_4_land_plants_I.pdf", "passage_text": "Finally, these plants are gametophyte dominant, meaning that the recognizable stage of these plants is the haploid gametophyte generation.

All bryophytes, i.e. liverworts, mosses and hornworts, have the gametophyte generation as the most conspicuous. As an illustration, consider a monoicous moss. 1 The moss Mnium hornum has the gametophyte as the dominant generation. 2  It is dioicous: male plants produce only antheridia in terminal rosettes, female plants produce only archegonia in the form of stalked capsules. 3  Seed plant gametophytes are also dioicous."}, {"url": "http://faculty.weber.edu/sharley/1203/ferns.html", "passage_text": "Sporophyte: Reproduce asexually by growing new leaves out of the rhizome each year.
