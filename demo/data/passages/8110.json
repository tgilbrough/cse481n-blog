When there are few copies of an allele, the effect of genetic drift is larger, and when there are many copies the effect is smaller."}, {"url": "http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/06/3/l_063_03.html", "passage_text": "The founder effect is an extreme example of  genetic drift ..

The Founder Effect is defined as a type of bottleneck, a type of genetic drift describing the loss of the allelic variation that accompanies founding of a new population from a very small number of individuals (a small sample of a much larger source population).

An example of a bottleneck effect: Northern elephant seals have reduced genetic variation most likely due to being hunted.

Genetic drift is the process of changes of allele frequencies over generations in a random fashion. Genetic bottlenecks and founder effects are the most common effects of genetic drift. The rate of loss of alleles in a genetic drift is \u00bd N where N is the number of individuals in the initial population. The effect of genetic drift is inversely proportional to the size of the population. In small populations, most of the individuals tend to be homozygous for deleterious genes. The situation is similar to the effects of inbreeding."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck", "passage_text": "Population bottleneck followed by recovery or extinction. A population bottleneck (or genetic bottleneck) is a sharp reduction in the size of a population due to environmental events (such as earthquakes, floods, fires, disease, or droughts) or human activities (such as genocide). In consequence of such population size reductions and the loss of genetic variation, the robustness of the population is reduced and its ability to survive selecting environmental changes, like climate change or a shift in available resources, is reduced."}, {"url": "http://programs.clarendoncollege.edu/programs/NatSci/Biology/Zoology/zoo%20online%20outlines/Lab%20population%20genetics%202%20-%20fall%2011.pdf", "passage_text": "Genetic drift becomes a factor for evolution in populations that are formed from a small sample of a larger population by either the bottleneck effect or the founder effect.
