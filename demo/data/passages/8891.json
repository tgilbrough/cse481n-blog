Stomata are small pores, typically on the undersides of leaves, that are opened or closed under the control of a pair of banana-shaped cells called guard cells (see figure above). When open, stomata allow CO 2 to enter the leaf for synthesis of glucose, and also allow for water, H 2 O, and free oxygen, O 2, to escape."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma", "passage_text": "In botany, a stoma (plural stomata), also called a stomate (plural stomates) (from Greek \u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1, mouth), is a pore, found in the epidermis of leaves, stems, and other organs, that is used to control gas exchange. Stomata are present in the sporophyte generation of all land plant groups except liverworts. Dicotyledons usually have more stomata on the lower epidermis than the upper epidermis. Monocotyledons, on the other hand, usually have the same number of stomata on the two epidermes. In plants with floating leaves, stomata may be found only on the upper epidermis and submerged leaves may lack stomata entirely"}, {"url": "http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/L/Leaf.html", "passage_text": "Typically, most of the stomata (thousands per square centimeter) are located in the lower epidermis.
