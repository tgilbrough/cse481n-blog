Your period should return within six to eight weeks after you stop breastfeeding, though it can take months for it to be totally regular again. If you think you should be menstruating and you're not, give your doctor a call. Q: How soon will I get my period back after having my baby? A: If you're not breastfeeding, it usually takes about six to eight weeks for your period to return to normal after delivery. If you're nursing, there's no need to stock up on tampons just yet"}, {"url": "http://www.mamapedia.com/article/how-long-does-it-take-for-your-period-to-get-back-to-normal-after", "passage_text": "Hi. It is normal not to have periods while you are nursing. Your hormones may be getting back to normal since it sounds as if you have cut back on nursing your baby. While I nursed my daughter, I did not have my period. However, after I stopped nursing, my period came back with a couple of months. Hope this helps.

It is not unusual for a woman's menstrual cycle to go quicker or slower than normal while she is breastfeeding. Sometimes a woman who is breastfeeding will skip periods altogether, or have months in between periods. If your periods become irregular, or you are not fully breastfeeding and your periods have not returned after a few months, you should speak to your GP or health visitor for advice.

There are differences among individual women and their hormone levels, so it\u2019s difficult to say when a period will recommence after childbirth.

It varies from woman to woman. If you are breastfeeding, you may ovulate as early as nine weeks or 10 weeks after giving birth.
