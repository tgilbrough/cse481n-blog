Making a bone grow in diameter is a more straightforward process. To make a bone thicker, just add new bone tissue to the outside. It's like taking a pipe and adding layer after layer of duct tape to it. The pipe would get thicker and heavier as you go. The problem is the bone gets thicker and heavier as you go. Growth in length. To make a bone longer just add bone tissue to the ends. The problem is, we can't add directly to the end of a bone, it has to move at the joints. If tissue is added at the end of the bone the skeleton could not move properly."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyseal_plate", "passage_text": "The epiphyseal plate (or epiphysial plate, physis, or growth plate) is a hyaline cartilage plate in the metaphysis at each end of a long bone.

Growth plates are located on the long bones of children and young people. These plates are areas of growing tissue near the end of the bones. Each long bone has at least two growth plates-one at each end. This is where the long bones grow. When young people finish growing, the growth plates close and are replaced by solid bone. Growth plate injuries occur mainly at the wrist, bones of the legs, or in the ankle, foot, or hip bones. The growth plate is the weakest part of the growing skeleton. Injuries to the plates are called fractures.

Creating a simple yeast starter as outlined here at brewersfriend.com will greatly increase your yeast cell count, but there is a way to easily supercharge this process. By using a stir plate you will be able to grow nearly 100% more yeast cells using the same volume of starter in the same amount of time. Basically, for the same investment in yeast, time and starter liquid, you will be able to double your yeast production with a stir plate.
