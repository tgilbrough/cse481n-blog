Comparable Rents. The first strategy to do is to find comparable rentals in your area to set your price in a reasonable range or to figure out the going rate for a similar room. Put It on the Market. If there are no comparable rentals that you can find, you can just test out the market! If you aren\u2019t in a hurry to rent the room, price it at the high end of what you think is reasonable and see if you get any nibbles.

You may decide to round rents to the nearest quarter. For instance, if rents shown for two people are $429.81 and $370.19, for simplicity, you may decide to round those to $429.75 and $370.25. The sum of all rents may not equal the total rent due to rounding. For instance, it may show each of three people owing $333.33 rent on a $1000 a month unit. The sum of the rents is off by a penny, which someone will need to chip in. For the above calculations, a private bath is considered equal to 100-square-feet added to the bedroom area. If you only have three bedrooms, just fill out the first three rows. When done, hit Calculate, and each person's rent will be shown. That's all there is to it!
