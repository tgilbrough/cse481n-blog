In a literary sense, says William Harmon, a symbol combines a literal and sensuous quality with an abstract or suggestive aspect (A Handbook to Literature, 2006). In language studies, symbol is sometimes used as another term for logograph. See Examples and Observations below. 1 Although symbolism works by the power of suggestion, a symbol is not the same as a meaning or a moral. 2  A symbol cannot be an abstraction. 3  Rather, a symbol is the thing that points to the abstraction. 4  In Poe's 'The Raven,' death isn't the symbol; the bird is."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Give_an_example_of_arbitrary_symbolism", "passage_text": "A flag is a symbol of a country.

There are many incorrect definitions of language, and this is one. Some language is not vocal. And arbitrary symbols would be unintelligible to anyone except the person making them up. Better to define language as a complex system of symbols used to convey meaning, feeling and intent. Still not a complete definition, but at least it is not wrong"}, {"url": "http://intro2gl.blogspot.com/2008/09/language-is-arbitrary-conventional.html", "passage_text": "The term arbitrary here refers to the fact that the symbol that people use is made or chosen without any principle, logic or reason.

So, to answer Daniel's question: English people do not have any reason why they call the animal that produces meauwww as cat.

The relation between the word-symbol apple and the fruit it signifies is arbitrary, established by a convention handed down by word of mouth in a given speech community. For instance, the octagonal shape of a stop sign is a symbol, as is the white and red striped pole which signifies a barber shop.
