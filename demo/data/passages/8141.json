Children may be given a psychomotor test for diagnostic purposes if a developmental delay is suspected. Children must develop a number of psychomotor abilities before they can buckle or tie their own shoes. A range of basic skills are tested during a psychomotor test, from precision, dexterity, coordination and control to reaction times, stability, speed and coherence."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychomotor_learning", "passage_text": "In psychomotor learning research, attention is given to the learning of coordinated activity involving the arms, hands, fingers, and feet, while verbal processes are not emphasized. When learning psychomotor skills, individuals progress through the cognitive stages, the associative stage, and the autonomic stage. The cognitive stage is marked by awkward slow and choppy movements that the learner tries to control. The learner has to think about each movement before attempting it."}, {"url": "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/psychomotor+test", "passage_text": "test 1. n. 1.
