The bacterial ribosome is a cytoplasmic nucleoprotein particle whose main function is to serve as the site of mRNA translation and protein synthesis. The ribosome has a mass of about 2.5 MDa, with RNA accounting for 2/3 of the mass. It consists of two subunits denoted 30S (small subunit) and 50S (large). During protein synthesis a ribosome moves along an mRNA molecule, reading the codon and adding the correct amino acid (from the corresponding aminoacyl tRNA) to the growing protein. When a stop codon is reached,translation ceases, and the mRNA and protein are released."}, {"url": "http://biology.tutorvista.com/animal-and-plant-cells/ribosomes.html", "passage_text": "The ribosomes present in the prokaryotes function differently in protein production than the ribosomes of the eukaryote organisms. The ribosomes of bacteria, archea and eukaryotes differ significantly from each other in structure and RNA sequences. Plant cell do have ribosomes and they are composed of proteins and ribosomal RNA. The ribosomes in a plant cell are found in the cytoplasm, the surface of the rough e ndoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria and on chloroplasts.

Ribosomes are composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and protein. Prokaryotic cells have three types of rRNA: 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA, and 5S rRNA.

Bacterial ribosomes, for instance, have about half of the amount of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and one third fewer ribosomal proteins (53 vs. ~83) than eukaryotic ribosomes have. Despite these differences, the function of the prokaryotic ribosome is virtually identical to the eukaryotic version. Just like in eukaryotic cells, prokaryotic ribosomes build proteins by translating messages sent from DNA. All prokaryotic cells contain large quantities of genetic material in the form of DNA and RNA."}, {"url": "http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/bacteriacell.html", "passage_text": "In gram-negative bacteria, the cell wall is thin and releases the dye readily when washed with an alcohol or acetone solution.
