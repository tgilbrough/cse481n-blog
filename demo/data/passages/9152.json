Dopamine also helps regulate movement and emotional responses, and it enables us not only to see rewards, but to take action to move toward them. Dopamine deficiency results in Parkinson's Disease, and people with low dopamine activity may be more prone to addiction. The presence of a certain kind of dopamine receptor is also associated with sensation-seeking people, more commonly known as risk takers.."}, {"url": "http://www.mayfieldclinic.com/PE-PD.htm", "passage_text": "Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive disorder that affects nerve cells deep in the brain responsible for planning and controlling body movement. Dopamine is a chemical used in body movement. Nerve cells in the substantia nigra produce the neurotransmitter dopamine and are responsible for relaying messages that plan and control body movement. For reasons not yet understood, the dopamine-producing nerve cells of the substantia nigra begin to die off in some individuals."}, {"url": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mouse-man/200904/what-is-dopamine", "passage_text": "Lets start with the basics.

The brain includes several distinct dopamine systems, one of which plays a major role in reward-motivated behavior. L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, does reach the brain and is the most widely used treatment for Parkinson's disease. Dopaminergic stimulants can be addictive in high doses, but some are used at lower doses to treat ADHD."}, {"url": "http://nihseniorhealth.gov/parkinsonsdisease/whatcausesparkinsonsdisease/01.html", "passage_text": "Dopamine is a chemical messenger, or neurotransmitter. Dopamine is responsible for transmitting signals between the substantia nigra and multiple brain regions. The connection between the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum is critical to produce smooth, purposeful movement. A Shortage of Dopamine. Parkinson's disease occurs when nerve cells, or neurons, in an area of the brain that controls movement become impaired and/or die. Normally, these neurons produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine, but when the neurons die or become impaired, they produce less dopamine."}, {"url": "https://anxietyreliefstress.com/dopamine-and-serotonin-brain-chemicals-and-your-happiness/", "passage_text": "Dopamine \u2013 The Pleasure Chemical.
