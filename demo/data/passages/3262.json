Blowing from the subtropical highs or horse latitudes toward the low pressure of the ITCZ are the trade winds. Named from their ability to quickly propel trading ships across the ocean, the trade winds between about 30\u00b0 latitude and the equator are steady and blow about 11 to 13 miles per hour. The doldrums, usually located between 5\u00b0 north and 5\u00b0 south of the equator, are also known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone or ITCZ for short. The trade winds converge in the region of the ITCZ, producing convectional storms that produce some of the world's heaviest precipitation regions."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_wind", "passage_text": "The trade winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere, strengthening during the winter and when the Arctic oscillation is in its warm phase. The surface air that flows from these subtropical high-pressure belts toward the Equator is deflected toward the west in both hemispheres by the Coriolis effect. These winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere."}, {"url": "http://www.kidsgeo.com/geography-for-kids/0094-trade-winds.php", "passage_text": "At the same time, in the Southern Hemisphere above the subtropical high, which is located just below the equator, we also find that winds are blowing from the east towards the west. The result is that between 30 \u00b0 North latitude and 30 \u00b0 South latitude winds usually blow from the east towards the west. Winds are named for the direction from which they come. Thus, this wind is referred to as an easterly wind. These easterly winds are known as the trade winds.
