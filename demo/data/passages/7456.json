Pituitary dwarfism is caused by problems arising from the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland, also called the hypophysis, is a gland at the base of the brain that produces many different hormones. This gland is divided into the anterior (front) and posterior (back) halves. There are many forms of dwarfism. The word pituitary is in reference to the pituitary gland in the body. This gland regulates certain chemicals (hormones) in the body. Therefore, pituitary dwarfism is decreased bodily growth due to hormonal problems."}, {"url": "http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dwarfism/basics/causes/CON-20032297", "passage_text": "Causes. Most dwarfism-related conditions are genetic disorders, but the causes of some disorders are unknown. Most occurrences of dwarfism result from a random genetic mutation in either the father's sperm or the mother's egg rather than from either parent's complete genetic makeup."}, {"url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9401536", "passage_text": "The Dwarfs of Sindh: severe growth hormone (GH) deficiency caused by a mutation in the GH-releasing hormone receptor gene.

The Update of Guidelines for the Use of Growth Hormone in Children 12 has suggested that GH therapy for GHD be initiated only after an MRI or a computed tomography (CT) scan has excluded an intracranial mass lesion."}]
