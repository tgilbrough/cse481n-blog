Stucco is applied wet and hardens to a very dense solid. It is used as decorative coating for walls and ceilings and as a sculptural and artistic material in architecture. Until the latter part of the nineteenth century, it was common that plaster, which was used inside a building, and stucco, which was used outside, would consist of the same primary materials: lime and sand (which are also used in mortar). Animal or plant fibers were often added for additional strength."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stucco", "passage_text": "Traditional stucco is made of lime, sand, and water. Modern stucco is made of Portland cement, sand, and water. Lime is added to increase the permeability and workability of modern stucco.

The temperature needs to be above 40 F for at least a week to keep the curing process going. Chicken wire and lath can impede the lime plaster from bonding fully to the straw. When applying lime stucco over strawbale walls, I recommend 3 coats of lime directly on the strawbales. The first coat can be up to 5/8 thick if it is applied to strawbale, otherwise each coat should be a maximum of 3/8 to 1/2 thick."}, {"url": "http://usheritage.com/plaster-stucco/", "passage_text": "Heritage Natural Hydraulic Lime Stucco/Plaster is a dry material with aggregate preblended into the product.
