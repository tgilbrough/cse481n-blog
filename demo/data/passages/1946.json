The hard facts are that the cost of owning a dog is an extremely important consideration for a number of often overlooked reasons. The first concerns the purchase price of the dog. Many people balk at paying $500 to $1000 for a dog. They rationalize that they simply can not afford it and settle for a poorly bred $150 puppy instead. What a huge mistake. The cost of a guaranteed healthy, well-bred $1000 puppy is a fraction of what it will cost to own that dog for 12 years. A poorly bred dog with bad hips, allergies, and a not so bright disposition will end up costing you thousands more in medical bills not to mention hours of frustration and disappointment"}, {"url": "http://pets.thenest.com/monthly-cost-food-siberian-husky-9569.html", "passage_text": "The feeding recommendation for an adult Siberian husky is 1 \u00bd - 2 cans of wet food per day, based on a 12-oz can.
