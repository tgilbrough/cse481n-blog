Count the number of beats in 15 seconds and multiply by four to get the heart rate in beats per minute (bpm). A normal cat's heart rate is between 140 and 220 bpm, with a relaxed cat measuring on the low end. Call your veterinarian if the heart rate is too rapid, too slow or irregular. Take your cat's respiratory rate. Watch your cat breathe when he is relaxed and standing; focus on the movement of the abdomen and chest wall. "}]
