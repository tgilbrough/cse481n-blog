The moon is just under 250,000 miles from Earth, so light from the Moon's surface has to travel more than one second (about 1.3 seconds) to reach us. Among other things, the astronauts left reflecting mirrors on the moon. Since moonlight is reflected sunlight, it originates at the Sun's surface 93 million miles from the Earth/Moon system. It takes about 8 minutes for that trip, so the short, final hop from the Moon to the Earth is trivial by comparison."}, {"url": "http://www.physics.ucsd.edu/~tmurphy/apollo/basics.html", "passage_text": "Better than a stopwatch... In essence, we measure the time it takes for the pulse of light to travel to the moon and back. This can take anywhere from 2.34 to 2.71 seconds, depending on how far away the moon is at the time (the earth-moon distance ranges from 351,000 km to 406,000 km). To do this, we have a laser that generates intense bursts of light only 100 picoseconds longthat's one tenth of a billionth of a second!
