Fuel for the fire is provided by charcoal lining the bottom of the structure."}, {"url": "http://www.thekitchn.com/all-about-tandoor-ovens-what-t-90121", "passage_text": "Pin it. These kinds of ovens are used throughout the Middle East, India, Pakistan, and even parts of Central Asia and China. They can be large, permanent structures ensconced in a kitchen or outdoor area, or they can be smaller, portable ovens that can be carried from place to place. One of the biggest advantages of these ovens is that once they are heated, they will maintain a consistent high temperature for hours with very little additional fuel. This is a big plus in parts of the world where fuel is scarce."}, {"url": "http://masala-art.com/2012/04/25/what-is-tandoori-cooking/", "passage_text": "While a tandoor can be used to prepare breads but is also commonly used for preparing marinated meats or vegetables over an intense charcoal fire.
