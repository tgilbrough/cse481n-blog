It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere. Regardless of the time of year, the northern and southern hemispheres always experience opposite seasons. This is because during summer or winter, one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the Sun (see Fig. 1) than the other, and this exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit."}, {"url": "http://www.ecology.com/2011/09/10/tilting-earth-shaping-seasons/", "passage_text": "Hurtling through space at an average speed of 18.4 miles per second (30km per second), Earth is constantly changing its position with the sun.
