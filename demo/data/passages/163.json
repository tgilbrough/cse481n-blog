This gives us a host with 8 processor cores, 32 GB of memory, 1 TB of disk and 6 network interface cards (NICs). So if we chose the no failover route the cost comparison between eight physical servers and one virtual host is $9,080 vs. $9,548.

It's not uncommon to find a virtual server using 50% or more of its computing resources. The cost benefits of virtualization are well understood: There are simply fewer servers, and each virtualized server can perform more business work per dollar spent on hardware, power, cooling, management and maintenance.
