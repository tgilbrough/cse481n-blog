This engine component is responsible for continuously pumping coolant throughout the cooling system. It is subjected to extreme temperatures, and because it is attached to the engine, spins at very high revolutions."}, {"url": "http://www.autos.com/car-maintenance/3-common-radiator-problems-and-how-to-avoid-them", "passage_text": "Check if the auxiliary fans are working and check coolant hoses for possible leaks. A greenish or bluish fluid leak could mean a broken or worn out hose. If no leak is evident check the coolant level in the coolant reservoir. DO NOT OPEN the engine radiator cap. Fill the reservoir with water or coolant when necessary."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/list_7686812_symptoms-radiator-going-bad.html", "passage_text": "Because the function of the radiator is to disperse heat from the car\u2019s liquid coolant and then return the coolant to the engine, the fluid must flow through the radiator and usually collects in the radiator reservoir.

The hot coolant comes out of the engine through the top hose, then goes through the radiator where it cools down. Then the coolant goes through the lower radiator hose back to the engine to repeat the cycle. Sounds like your cooling system is okay.
