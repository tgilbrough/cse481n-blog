Glaciers can be separated into two broad categories: Continental and Alpine. Continental glaciers form horizontal sheets, accumulating hundreds of meters in thickness-they flatten everything in their path."}, {"url": "http://beyondpenguins.ehe.osu.edu/issue/icebergs-and-glaciers/glaciers-earths-rivers-of-ice", "passage_text": "Simply stated, a glacier is a large, slow-moving mass of ice. While there are many types of glaciers, they can be divided into two categories: alpine and continental. Alpine glaciers are found in a mountainous region and flow down valleys. Continental glaciers are dome-shaped glaciers that flow away from a central region and are largely unaffected by the land\u2019s topography. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are examples of continental glaciers. Smaller masses of ice, called ice caps, are also considered continental glaciers. Alpine glaciers are further classified by their shape as well as the surface they flow onto. Alpine glaciers flow down valleys, and continental glaciers flow outward in all directions from a central point. Glaciers move by two mechanisms: internal deformation and sliding. Internal deformation occurs when the enormous mass of a glacier causes it to spread out due to gravity."}, {"url": "http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/indiana/journeywithnature/how-glaciers-shaped-indiana.xml", "passage_text": "Glaciers are massive bodies of ice that slowly move across the landscape. They form by layers of snow compacted over the years to form a very thick layer of ice. Two primary types of glaciers exist: continental and alpine.

Continental glaciers are continuous masses of ice that are much larger than alpine glaciers. Small continental glaciers are called ice fields. Big continental glaciers are called ice sheets.

Like continental glaciers, alpine glaciers create land forms by weathering and deposition. They typically erode the mountain beneath them into a u-shaped valley with steep sides. Some alpine or valley glaciers are 1000m thick and up to 160 km long, though most are only a few km in length."}]
