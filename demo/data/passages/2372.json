An electrical conduit is a tube used to protect and route electrical wiring in a building or nonbuilding structure. Electrical conduit may be made of metal, plastic, fiber, or fired clay. Most conduit is rigid, but flexible conduit is used for some purposes. Conduit is generally installed by electricians at the site of installation of electrical equipment."}, {"url": "http://www.homedepot.com/c/best_conduit_choices_from_plastic_pvc_to_metallic_HT_BG_EL", "passage_text": "Prewired conduit, or armored cable, offers an all-in-one solution with the wires already run through the flexible conduit. Generally made of PVC, rigid nonmetallic conduit is a good choice for outdoor residential applications, such as wiring landscape lighting or burying cables. PVC doesn\u2019t rust and the pieces are glued together with PVC cement making connections watertight. To learn more about conduit fittings, see our Fittings Buying Guide. Flexible metallic conduit bends and twists easily, allowing turns at corners without the use of separate elbow joints. It is often used where rigid conduit is difficult to install or to connect permanently wired appliances, such as a water heater."}, {"url": "http://www.homedepot.com/c/best_conduit_choices_from_plastic_pvc_to_metallic_HT_BG_EL", "passage_text": "Rigid metallic conduit is most often used in commercial applications, but it can be a smart choice for straight runs of wire or cable through an attic, garage, basement or crawlspace, as it protects against nicks, punctures or cuts to wiring, including nicks made by animals that may chew on exposed wiring.

Another example of rigid electrical conduit is the EMT, also known as Electrical Metallic Tubing. An EMT conduit is made of steel; in some cases aluminum is also used, cheaper than a galvanized rigid conduit and lighter than a GR conduit. Conduits: Aluminum Conduits. An aluminum conduit is a rigid conduit commonly used in commercial and industrial applications.
