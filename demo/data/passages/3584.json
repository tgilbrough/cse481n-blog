The digestive system relies on magnesium to help regulate blood sugar levels, control blood pressure, aid in metabolism, protein synthesis and activate enzymes for energy production. It is involved in more than 300 metabolic reactions and biochemical processes, include the digestion of food and release of nutrients for energy. Most of the body\u2019s magnesium is stored in the bone and within the cells of the body\u2019s tissues and organs.

Sadly, most people do not ingest nearly enough bioavailable calcium because when dairy products are pasteurized and homogenized, the calcium they contain is made less available to the body. In this case, calcium becomes biounavailable. That is, an excess occurs in the tissues but it is not available to the body. It becomes essentially a toxic mineral, causing calcium deposits in the joints, arteries, kidneys, brain and elsewhere."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-781-CALCIUM.aspx?activeIngredientId=781&activeIngredientName=CALCIUM", "passage_text": "High levels of phosphate in the blood (hyperphosphatemia) or low levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia) : Calcium and phosphate have to be in balance in the body.

Research shows that they are absorbed equally well with meals, but calcium carbonate is harder to digest than calcium citrate. People are usually advised to take calcium carbonate with or soon after a meal. Most of the calcium in the American diet comes from dairy products. Not only do they contain a lot of the mineral, but it's in a form that's easy to digest and absorb.

Calcium is involved in the secretion of male and female hormones, cell division and the water balance of the body. It also stabilizes cell membranes, helps muscles relax, and slows nerve transmission and the heart rate. Calcium also helps prevent fluid loss from cells and from the blood.
