Before beginning its deliberations, the jury will usually be given detailed instructions by the trial judge. These instructions explain the laws that apply to the case and what the jury should do in applying the law to the facts in order to figure out its verdict. Sometimes, jury instructions can be quite long, particularly in complicated cases with multiple plaintiffs or defendants or cases that are based on complex issues.

Since 1974 juries have been allowed, in certain circumstances, to reach a majority verdict. This is a verdict of 11-1 or 10-2. If there are 9 or fewer jurors then the verdict has to be unanimous. The minimum period of time that the jury have to have been thinking about their verdict (\u2018in retirement\u2019) before a jury can return a majority verdict is 2 hours 10 minutes.

The judge will instruct jurors not to read or view reports of the case in the news. Nor should they consider or discuss the case while outside of the jury room. If the jurors cannot agree on a verdict, a hung jury results, leading to a mistrial. The case is not decided, and it may be tried again at a later date before a new jury. Or the plaintiff or government may decide not to pursue the case further and there will be no subsequent trial. In some states, the jury may take the exhibits introduced into the record and the judge's instructions to the jury room. Sometimes the jury will have a question about the evidence or the judge's instructions. If this happens, the jury will give a note to the bailiff to take to the judge."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101110023749AAvSeeq", "passage_text": "Best Answer: There is no minimum or maximum amount of time a jury must deliberate. It is up to the judge. A criminal defendant is not acquitted because of a hung jury. The government can make the person go through another trial. If the parties want a select number of the jurors to agree in a civil case and the current jury is unable to meet that level, the judge will declare a mistrial and the parties will try the case again with a different jury.
