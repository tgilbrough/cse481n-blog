In its simplest form, an inductor consistsof a wire loop or coil. The inductance is directly proportional to the number ofturns in the coil. Inductance also depends on the radius of the coil and on the type of material around which the coil is wound."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductance", "passage_text": "In electromagnetism and electronics, inductance is the property of an electrical conductor by which a change in current flowing through it induces an electromotive force in both the conductor itself and in any nearby conductors by mutual inductance."}, {"url": "http://www.electronics-tutorials.com/basics/inductance.htm", "passage_text": "The property of inductance might be described as when any piece of wire is wound into a coil form it forms an inductance which is the property of opposing any change in current. Alternatively it could be said inductance is the property of a circuit by which energy is stored in the form of an electromagnetic field. We said a piece of wire wound into a coil form has the ability to produce a counter emf (opposing current flow) and therefore has a value of inductance."}]
