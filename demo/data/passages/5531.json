An E. coli RNA polymerase is composed of five subunits: two \u03b1 subunits, and one for each \u03b2, \u03b2', and \u03c3 subunit. \u03b2 (151 kD) and \u03b2' (156 kD) are significantly larger than \u03b1 (37 kD). Several different forms of \u03c3 subunits have been identified, with molecular weights ranging from 28 kD to 70 kD. Both RNA and DNA polymerases can add nucleotides to an existing strand, extending its length. However, there is a major difference between the two classes of enzymes: RNA polymerases can initiate a new strand but DNA polymerases cannot."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase", "passage_text": "Compare RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

Best Answer: RNA polymerase (RNAP or RNApol) is an enzyme that produces RNA. In cells, RNAP is needed for constructing RNA chains from DNA genes as templates, a process called transcription. RNA polymerase enzymes are essential to life and are found in all organisms and many viruses. In chemical terms, RNAP is a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript"}]
