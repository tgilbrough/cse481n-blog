Inside this Chromatids are the genetic sequences know as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). All of this is located in the nucleus of the cell. Chromosomes are made up of tightly wound bands of DNA, which is made up of Four nucleotide bases, adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, with sugar and phospate bonds.

Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the mitochondrial genome."}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_aqa_pre_2011/celldivision/celldivision1.shtml", "passage_text": "Chromosomes are made from DNA.
