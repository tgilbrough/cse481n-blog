However, in 2003 it was discovered to be weakly radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a half life more than a billion times the estimated age of the universe. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead.

There is only one isotope of bismuth ordinarily found in nature, 209Bi, and though it is radioactive, it is only barely so, having a half life of 19,000,000,000,000,000,000 years, a fact only recently discovered.
