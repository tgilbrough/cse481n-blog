This high-strength, slightly stretchy tissue consists mainly of collagen, a protein which is known for providing strength and stability. Connective tissue is one of the four main tissue types; the others are epithelial tissue, muscle tissue and nervous tissue. Connective tissue includes tissues such as cartilage, bone, blood and fat. In this lesson, we'll be specifically looking at fibrous connective tissue."}, {"url": "http://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-Fibrosis.aspx", "passage_text": "By Sally Robertson, BSc. The term fibrosis describes the development of fibrous connective tissue as a reparative response to injury or damage. Fibrosis may refer to the connective tissue deposition that occurs as part of normal healing or to the excess tissue deposition that occurs as a pathological process. When fibrosis occurs in response to injury, the term \u201cscarring\u201d is used. Pulmonary fibrosis refers to a number of conditions that cause interstitial lung damage, followed by fibrosis and eventually loss of lung elasticity. These conditions lead to symptoms such as persistent cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing and fatigue."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis", "passage_text": "Scar formation, the accumulation of excess fibrous connective tissue (the process called fibrosis), leads to thickening of the walls, and causes reduced oxygen supply in the blood. As a consequence patients suffer from perpetual shortness of breath. Pulmonary fibrosis (literally scarring of the lungs ) is a respiratory disease in which scars are formed in the lung tissues, leading to serious breathing problems."}, {"url": "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fibrosis", "passage_text": "Medical Definition of FIBROSIS. : a condition marked by increase of interstitial fibrous tissue: fibrous degeneration.

Physiologically, fibrosis acts to deposit connective tissue, which can obliterate the architecture and function of the underlying organ or tissue.
