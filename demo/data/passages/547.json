Inflammation is initiated upon tissue injury and sets off a cascade of biochemical reactions that prime the nervous system for pain sensing. Moreover, long-term inflammation reinforces adaptive changes in the nervous system that can cause the sensation of pain to become exaggerated or inappropriate (Ji 2011). Therefore, taking steps to ease inflammation is an effective means of interfering with the process of pain sensitization. This is why drugs like acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol\u00ae) and ibuprofen, which are anti-inflammatory in nature, relieve pain."}, {"url": "http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20705881,00.html", "passage_text": "Inflammation is part of the body\u2019s immune response; without it, we can't heal.

Inflammation is a protective response that involves immune cells, blood vessels, and molecular mediators. Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic.

This can result in stiffness, soreness, and in many cases, swelling. Inflammatory and non-inflammatory arthritis are the two most common forms of the condition. However, there are dozens of different arthritis types. Even though it is called non-inflammatory arthritis, OA still results in inflammation of the joints. The difference is that this inflammation is the result of wear and tear. In particular, OA results from the breakdown of cartilage."}]
