This glucose can be converted into pyruvate which releases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by cellular respiration. Oxygen is also formed.

Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be used as fuels in cellular respiration, but glucose is most commonly used as an example to examine the reactions and pathways involved. Plants go through a process known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis can be thought of as the opposite process of cellular respiration. Through two processes known as the light reactions and the dark reactions, plants have the ability to absorb and utilize the energy in sunlight."}, {"url": "http://biology-forums.com/index.php?topic=41672.0", "passage_text": "Credits: 10. 0 0.

Glucose and oxygen are the products. Just remember there are other products that are made in the process of photosynthesis, but ar \u2026 e used elsewhere. An example of this is NADPH. NADPH is a product of PS1, but then is used in the Calvin Cycle. Carbon dioxide and water are the two reactants, and carbohydrates (glucose) and oxygen are the end products. Sunlight is the energy source for the endothermic reaction. Along with glucose, products including ATP and other intermediary chemicals are produced."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_reactants_are_involved_in_photosynthesis", "passage_text": "The reactants that are involved in photosynthesis are carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight.

These reactants mix to form food for the plant and oxygen for animals."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis", "passage_text": "This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water \u2013 hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek \u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2, ph\u014ds, light, and \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, synthesis, putting together.

Photosynthesis. The net process of photosynthesis is described by the following equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy = C6H12O6 + 6O2. This equation simply means that carbon dioxide from the air and water combine in the presence of sunlight to form sugars; oxygen is released as a by-product of this reaction."}]
