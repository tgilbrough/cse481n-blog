And many do: The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that, while 91% of full-time employees in private industry receive some paid vacation, only 37% of part-time employees do. Because no law requires employers to provide paid vacation, employers have free reign when it comes to determining how much vacation to offer and to which employees. Employers can provide only a few paid days off a year or a couple of months' worth."}, {"url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/06/08/countries-most-vacation-days/2400193/", "passage_text": "In addition, there are between nine to 13 paid holidays, in addition to the 24 paid vacation days.

For example, I got a whopping three days this year, but it's because I didn't work a full year last year. When you only work a partial year, your vacation time here is based on full months of service. Next year I'll get 5 days, the year after that I'll get 10. The guys that have been here a while get 3 weeks. That being said, there are ways to extend that WAAAAY past what you actually get awarded. I get 42 days per year. All pilots get that from day one. Similar to others it's pretty easy to add days off on both ends to make for longer stretches in a row. Best I've done is 35 in a row using 24 days of vacation."}, {"url": "http://lifehacker.com/5628777/how-many-vacation-days-do-you-get-every-year", "passage_text": "Total Votes: 18,890.

Although certainly not a bad wage, this is perhaps not as high as some people might suspect a pilot earns. Because pilots are limited to about 1,000 flying hours per year, many people think it's a fairly relaxed job. But pilots actually work about 225 hours each month. This can include non-flight duties such as flight scheduling, record keeping and the arrangement of aircraft maintenance."}]
