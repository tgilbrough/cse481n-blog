A This disease is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The lung tissue is gradually replaced by fibrous tissue similar to that seen in scarring. This results in the lung being unable to absorb oxygen, producing typical signs of a decrease in exercise tolerance, panting and later a persistent cough which is particularly evident when exercising. The reason for the replacement of lung tissue with fibrous tissue is unknown, which is why this is called idiopathic. The problem is seen most often in West Highland whites and is frequently diagnosed at around nine years of age."}, {"url": "http://www.westylungdisease.com/", "passage_text": "Westy/Westie Lung Disease is also known as Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
