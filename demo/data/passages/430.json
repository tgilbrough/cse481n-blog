Both, however, must carry out the same life processes. Some features distinguishing prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are shown in Table 1. - Eukaryotic cells may have flagella or cilia. Flagella and cilia are organelles involved in locomotion and in eukaryotic cells consist of a distinct arrangement of sliding microtubules surrounded by a membrane. The microtubule arrangement is referred to as a 2X9+2 arrangement (see Fig. 9)."}, {"url": "http://education.seattlepi.com/three-examples-prokaryote-three-examples-eukaryote-4492.html", "passage_text": "A prokaryote is a cell without a nucleus and eukaryotes are cells that contain nuclei.
