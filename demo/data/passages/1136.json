The cell wall surrounds the plasma membrane of plant cells and provides tensile strength and protection against mechanical and osmotic stress. Plant cells have certain distinguishing features, including chloroplasts, cell walls, and intracellular vacuoles. Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts; cell walls allow plants to have strong, upright structures; and vacuoles help regulate how cells handle water and storage of other molecules. eBooks."}, {"url": "http://www.cellsalive.com/cells/cell_model.htm", "passage_text": "Chloroplast (plant cells only) : Chloroplasts are specialized organelles found in all higher plant cells.

Therefore they are only present in photosynthetic cells e.g. plant cells and algae. There are no chloroplasts in animal cells or bacteria cells (bacteria cells are also known as prokaryotic cells and do not contain any membrane-bound organelles). As shown in the diagram of a plant cell, chloroplasts are bigger and fatter than mitochondria. : A chloroplast is an organelle (found inside plant cells but not animal cells); a chloroplast is not a cell.

Like the mitochondrion, the chloroplast is different from most other organelles because it has its own DNA and reproduces independently of the cell in which it is found; an apparent case of endosymbiosis."}, {"url": "http://biology.tutorvista.com/animal-and-plant-cells/chloroplasts.html", "passage_text": "Chloroplasts are organelles present in plant cells and some eukaryotic organisms. Chloroplasts are the most important plastids found in plant cells. It is the structure in a green plant cell in which photosynthesis occurs. Chloroplast is one of the three types of plastids. The chloroplast are double membrane bound organelles and are the site of photosynthesis The chloroplasts have a system of three membranes: the outer membrane, the inner membrane and the thylakoid system.

Mitochondria and chloroplasts have striking similarities to bacteria cells. They have their own DNA, which is separate from the DNA found in the nucleus of the cell. And both organelles use their DNA to produce many proteins and enzymes required for their function. "}]
