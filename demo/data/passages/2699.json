The popliteus and soleus, both muscles in the calf, also attach to the tibia. Some of the muscles that extend and flex the ankles and toes, such as the tibialis anterior, also attach to this bone."}, {"url": "http://www.innerbody.com/image_skelfov/skel28_new.html", "passage_text": "The tibia, sometimes known as the shin bone, is the larger and stronger of the two lower leg bones. It forms the knee joint with the femur and the ankle joint with the fibula and tarsus. Many powerful muscles that move the foot and lower leg are anchored to the tibia."}, {"url": "http://www.innerbody.com/image_skelfov/skel27_new.html", "passage_text": "Many muscles of the thigh and lower leg attach to the fibula through tendons. One of the hamstrings, the biceps femoris muscle, has its insertion at the head of the fibula and pulls on the fibula to flex the leg at the knee."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/54072-list-muscles-attached-major-bones/", "passage_text": "The femur, the bone in the upper leg, is the attachment site for numerous muscles. The gastrocnemius, one of the calf muscles, attaches here, as do all of the glute muscles. Three of the four quadriceps muscles attach to various points on the femur as well."}, {"url": "http://www.innerbody.com/image_skelfov/skel27_new.html", "passage_text": "Click to read more below. The fibula is the long, thin and lateral bone of the lower leg. It runs parallel to the tibia, or shin bone, and plays a significant role in stabilizing the ankle and supporting the muscles of the lower leg. Compared to the tibia, the fibula is about the same length, but is considerably thinner."}]
