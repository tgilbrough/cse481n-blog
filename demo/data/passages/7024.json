These organic compounds are a class of polyols, also called polyhydric alcohol, polyalcohol, alditol or glycitol. As a group, sugar alcohols are not as sweet as sucrose, and they have less food energy than sucrose. Their flavor is like sucrose, and they can be used to mask the unpleasant aftertastes of some high intensity sweeteners."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_alcohol", "passage_text": "In commercial foodstuffs, sugar alcohols are commonly used in place of table sugar (sucrose), often in combination with high intensity artificial sweeteners to counter the low sweetness.

Its structure is kind of a hybrid between a sugar molecule and an alcohol molecule (hence the name \u201csugar alcohol\u201d) and, for the most part, our bodies do a poor job of digesting and breaking down sugar alcohol in the small bowel."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/sugar-alcohols", "passage_text": "Sugar alcohols occur naturally in plant foods in small amounts, such as berries and fruits.

Sugar alcohols are used to sweeten diet foods. They are also used in chewing gums, toothpaste, and mouthwash.
