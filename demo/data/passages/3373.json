Nucleic acids are polymers, very large molecules that consist of much smaller units repeated many times over and over again. The small units of which polymers are made are known as monomers. In the case of nucleic acid, the monomers are called nucleotides."}, {"url": "http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/nucleic-acid-274", "passage_text": "nucleic acid.

Whether the acid contains uracil or thymine determines whether it is DNA (thymine) or RNA (uracil). Examples of Nucleic Acids: 1. DNA. Deoxyribonucleic acid, also known as DNA, is a well-known component in genetics. It contains all of the genetic information for a living organism, carried as long strings of information called genes. These genes are found in the nucleus of the cells. A polymer structure made of sugar provides the attachment point for the nucleobases that make up the DNA. The combinations of where these nucleobases attach forms our hereditary traits. 2."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "passage_text": "Nucleic Acids are biopolymers, or large biomolecules, essential for all known forms of life. Nucleic acids, which include DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid), are made from monomers known as nucleotides. Each nucleotide has three components: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. If the sugar is deoxyribose, the polymer is DNA. If the sugar is ribose, the polymer is RNA"}, {"url": "http://www.newhealthadvisor.com/Examples-of-Nucleic-Acids.html", "passage_text": "The many examples of nucleic acids including RNA (ribonucleic acid) and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) are composed of monomers called nucleotides. A nucleotide contains 3 components: a nitrogenous base, a phosphate group and a 5-carbon sugar. If the sugar is ribose, then its polymer is RNA. 1. DNA. DNA is one of the examples of nucleic acids that holds the genetic information which is important in the functioning and development of all living things. The genetic information carried on the DNA segments is called genes. DNA is made up of two polymers that are formed by smaller units called nucleotides"}]
