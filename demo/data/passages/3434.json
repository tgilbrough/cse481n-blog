These species reproduce by shedding spores and have macroscopic alternation of generations, although some are homosporous while others are heterosporous. Members of Lycopodiophyta bear a protostele, and the sporophyte generation is dominant. They differ from all other vascular plants in having microphylls, leaves that have only a single vascular trace (vein) rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plant"}, {"url": "http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/plants/lycophyta/lycomm.html", "passage_text": "The arrangement of leaves depends very much on the particular lycophyte in question. Many club mosses have leaves which are attached in a spiral pattern, while in other creeping species the leaves are all oriented in the same plane. In some, the leaves are fused to the stem, giving them the appearance of tiny junipers. A cross section of a member of the order Lycopodiales is shown above.
