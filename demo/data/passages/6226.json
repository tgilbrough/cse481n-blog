Approximately 1% of these individuals exhibit severe compression associated with symptoms of MALS. The syndrome most commonly affects individuals between 20 and 40 years old, and is more common in women, particularly thin women. Celiac artery compression was first observed by Benjamin Lipshutz in 1917. MALS was first described by Pekka-Tapani Harjola in 1963 and subsequently by J. David Dunbar and Samuel Marable in 1965.

Grand mal seizures occur when the electrical activity over the whole surface of the brain becomes abnormally synchronized. The brain's nerve cells normally communicate with each other by sending electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect the cells. In people who have seizures, the brain's usual electrical activity is altered."}]
