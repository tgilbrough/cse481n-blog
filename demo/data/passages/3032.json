This is the beginning of its third year of use, and I had not had any problems until now. Recently I have had to charge it every day.

Charge your Clarisonic Sonic Cleansing Brush for 24 hours before your first use. Prior to using your Clarisonic Sonic Cleansing Brush, remove eye makeup by hand. Wet your face and brush head with warm water and apply cleanser (either to your face or the brush head directly, whichever you prefer)."}, {"url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeztwrWBu6k", "passage_text": "00825 Clairsonic Mia 2 Opening and Battery Crack-Here's a video I made of how I opened up the Clairsonic Mia 2. It was tricky, and required use of a good, sharp and strong utility knife. The Mia is a hard plastic device, and needs a strong blade to cut through it.
