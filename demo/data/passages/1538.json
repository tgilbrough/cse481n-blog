The area of the interface between the matrix and reinforcement phase(s) is typically an order of magnitude greater than for conventional composite materials. The matrix material properties are significantly affected in the vicinity of the reinforcement. In this group of composites the main part of the volume is occupied by a ceramic, i.e. a chemical compound from the group of oxides, nitrides, borides, silicides etc..

Of the many applications for nanocomposite materials, a few of interest are electronic, optical and biomedical. Nanocomposites combining a polymer base medium with carbon nanotubes are used in the packaging of electronics that require housings to dissipate static electrical charges and thermal buildups."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanocomposite", "passage_text": "Another kind of nanocomposite is the energetic nanocomposite, generally as a hybrid sol\u2013gel with a silica base, which, when combined with metal oxides and nano-scale aluminum powder, can form superthermite materials.

Nanocomposite is a multiphase solid material where one of the phases has one, two or three dimensions of less than 100 nanometers (nm), or structures having nano-scale repeat distances between the different phases that make up the material. In this group of composites the main part of the volume is occupied by a ceramic, i.e. a chemical compound from the group of oxides, nitrides, borides, silicides etc..

These may be of different shape (e.g., platelets, fibers, spheroids), but at least one dimension must be in the range of 1\u201350 nm. These PNC's belong to the category of multi-phase systems (MPS, viz. blends, composites, and foams) that consume nearly 95% of plastics production. This affects the properties of the particles when they are reacting with other particles. Because of the higher surface area of the nano-particles, the interaction with the other particles within the mixture is more and this increases the strength, heat resistance, etc. and many factors do change for the mixture."}, {"url": "http://www.understandingnano.com/nanocomposites-applications.html", "passage_text": "Nanocomposites, their Uses and Applications.
