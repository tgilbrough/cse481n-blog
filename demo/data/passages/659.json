Climate change and the need to manage diminishing fossil fuel reserves are, today, two of the biggest challenges facing the planet. The UK is a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol and is actively involved in measures to meet our commitment of a 12.5 per cent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by the period 2008-12. But there is no single solution for the UK or the 155 other countries also aiming to reduce their emissions."}, {"url": "http://extension.psu.edu/natural-resources/energy/solar-energy", "passage_text": "The sun is probably the most important source of renewable energy available today. Traditionally, the sun has provided energy for practically all living creatures on earth, through the process of photosynthesis, in which plants absorb solar radiation and convert it into stored energy for growth and development.

There are many different reasons why renewable energy is extremely important for the future of our society and throughout this article I will mention the ones that I find to be most important. Positive environmental impact is certainly one of the top reasons. The global clean energy race is very important and winners in this race will experience many political as well as economic benefits in years to come.
