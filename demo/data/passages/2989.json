Coccobacillus are rod-shaped bacteria. Cocco comes from cocci meaning spherical shaped and bacillus comes from bacilli meaning elongated. Three species in this genus are known to be pathogenic to humans. B. pertussis and B. parapertussis are very similar species. Both species cause pertussis (whooping cough) in humans and are separated merely by the toxins they release during infection. B. parapertussis releases toxins that seem to cause a milder form of pertussis (whooping cough). B. bronchiseptica causes respiratory disease in various mammals and occasionally in humans"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordetella_pertussis", "passage_text": "Bordetella pertussis is a Gram-negative, aerobic coccobacillus capsulate of the genus Bordetella, and the causative agent of pertussis or whooping cough.

In the 20 th century, pertussis was one of the most common childhood diseases and a major cause of childhood mortality in the United States. Pathogenesis. Pertussis is primarily a toxin-mediated disease. The bacteria attach to the cilia of the respiratory epithelial cells, produce toxins that paralyze the cilia, and cause inflammation of the respiratory tract, which interferes with the clearing of pulmonary secretions."}, {"url": "http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/causes-transmission.html", "passage_text": "Causes. Pertussis, a respiratory illness commonly known as whooping cough, is a very contagious disease caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. These bacteria attach to the cilia (tiny, hair-like extensions) that line part of the upper respiratory system. While pertussis vaccines are the most effective tool we have to prevent this disease, no vaccine is 100% effective. If pertussis is circulating in the community, there is a chance that a fully vaccinated person, of any age, can catch this very contagious disease."}, {"url": "http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/pertussis/Pages/causes.aspx", "passage_text": "Espanol: Espa\u00f1ol causas y.
