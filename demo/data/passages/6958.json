Depending on the type of interrogation, the transponder sends back a transponder code (or squawk code, Mode A) or altitude information (Mode C) to help air traffic controllers to identify the aircraft and to maintain separation between planes."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder_(aviation)", "passage_text": "Around busy airspace there is often a regulatory requirement that all aircraft be equipped with an altitude-reporting mode C or mode S transponders.

In air navigation or radio frequency identification, a flight transponder is a device that emits an identifying signal in response to an interrogating received signal.

Squawk thus can be said to mean select transponder code or squawking to mean I have selected transponder code xxxx.

The altitude-reporting capability of your transponder transmits your aircraft's PRESSURE ALTITUDE (rounded off to the nearest 100 feet) whenever it receives a Mode C interrogation and is switched to ALT mode. There's a new type of transponder called a Mode S transponder that is required for TCAS and may support datalink. A few years ago, the FAA tried to mandate that the fleet retire their Mode A/C transponders and upgrade to Mode S, but this move was strongly resisted by AOPA and other general aviation groups."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder", "passage_text": "A communications satellite \u2019s channels are called transponders, because each is a separate transceiver or repeater. With digital video data compression and multiplexing, several video and audio channels may travel through a single transponder on a single wideband carrier.

When the transponder receives a signal from a more sophisticated ground secondary radar, it returns a squawk code with the aircraft's position, its altitude and its call sign. It is constantly being radar pinged, helping air traffic controllers on the ground determine the airplane's speed and direction, too"}]
