Reverse polarity is the opposite of normal polarity. Normal polarity in electronics is when you have the positive hooked up to the positive terminal and the negative to the negative terminal.

Best Answer: Reverse polarity is the opposite of normal polarity. Normal polarity in electronics is when you have the positive hooked up to the positive terminal and the negative to the negative terminal. Reverse polarity would be having the positive hooked up to the negative terminal and the negative to the positive terminal. The same concept can be used with magnets. A magnetic field (like Earth's) has a north pole and a south pole. If it flips so that the north pole is where the south pole was and vice versa the polarity has reversed.

The proper way to connect your boat to shore power is to turn off the main breaker on the boat and the breaker at the shore power pedestal. Then make the connections with the shore power cord. "}]
