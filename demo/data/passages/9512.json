In fact, time might not either but the way we measure time (since we have no other measuring stick) is dependent on the speed of light which is why it comes out to zero for a photon. "}, {"url": "http://www.universetoday.com/111603/does-light-experience-time/", "passage_text": "Just think about that idea. From the perspective of a photon, there is no such thing as time. It\u2019s emitted, and might exist for hundreds of trillions of years, but for the photon, there\u2019s zero time elapsed between when it\u2019s emitted and when it\u2019s absorbed again. It doesn\u2019t experience distance either. Since photons do not experience time, from their point of view everything in their path is at the same place. If that is the case, then perhaps things that are weird for us, like Young\u2019s slits, make perfect sense when considered from the photon\u2019s point of view, the slits and the screen are squished to zero length."}, {"url": "http://www.quora.com/Does-a-photon-experience-time", "passage_text": "If the photon does not have a rest frame, we can't compare it to other reference frames, thus preventing us from telling what is going on there compared to other objects.In conclusion, it's not possible to think of the photon's point of view using our normal ideas of time and length. To us, time doesn't pass at all for a photon, because of time dilation (as speed approaches c, the relative time approaches infinity). But, for a photon, time dilation doesn't happen at all. It, instead, happens to us, and the universe as a whole."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-a-photon-definition-energy-wavelength.html", "passage_text": "A photon is the quantum of electromagnetic radiation that describes the particle properties of an electromagnetic wave. The energy of a photon is given by the equation E = hf, where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, and f is frequency. Definition of a Photon. A photon is the quantum of electromagnetic radiation. The term quantum is the smallest elemental unit of a quantity, or the smallest discrete amount of something.

Because of entanglement, reading this clock will affect the polarisation value of the second photon. Editorial&colon; \u201c Solving the eternal mystery that is time \u201c. Time is an illusion \u2013 at least in a toy model of the universe made of two particles of light.

The photon lives in a \u201cgo-splat\u201d world. The clock of a photon completely stops the instant it is emitted and stays stopped throughout its journey. The distance traveled by a photon becomes zero as compared to the distance measured by the stationary observer. Einstein gave us some tools to work with to describe the various space-time relativistic changes as shown in Figure 1. There is a mass equation also, but the mass increase is not a factor here, since we know that the photon has no rest mass."}, {"url": "http://www.quantumtheorys.com/Distance-Time/Photon%20Kinematics.html", "passage_text": "Since a body of matter cannot travel at speed c, a person cannot have a perspective from a reference frame traveling at speed c relative to any other body of matter. However, since light travels at speed c, there is no physical law prohibiting a person from imagining how a photon experiences time and space.

It is the force carrier for the electromagnetic force, even when static via virtual photons. The photon is the gauge boson for electromagnetism, and therefore all other quantum numbers of the photon (such as lepton number, baryon number, and flavour quantum numbers) are zero. Also, the photon does not obey the Pauli exclusion principle."}]
