In a macrocytic anemia the larger red cells are always associated with insufficient numbers of cells and often also insufficient hemoglobin content per cell. Both of these factors work to the opposite effect of larger cell size, to finally result in a total blood hemoglobin concentration that is less than normal (i.e., anemia).

Causes of macrocytosis are many and range from benign to malignant; thus, a complete workup to determine etiology is essential. Vitamin B-12 deficiency is a cause of macrocytosis. Because DNA synthesis requires cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) as a cofactor, a deficiency of the vitamin leads to decreased DNA synthesis in the erythrocyte, thus resulting in"}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/macrocytic-anemia-definition-and-causes.html", "passage_text": "A subtype of macrocytic anemia occurs with a normal RDW. One of the reasons for this is something known as aplastic anemia. Aplastic anemia refers to a disease where the bone marrow doesn't make enough red blood cells.

The most common cause of macrocytic anemia is megaloblastic anemia, which is the result of impaired DNA synthesis. Although DNA synthesis is impaired, RNA synthesis is unaffected, leading to a buildup of cytoplasmic components in a slowly dividing cell. This results in a larger-than-normal cell.
