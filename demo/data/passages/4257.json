The conducting system of the heart consists of cardiac muscle cells and conducting fibers (not nervous tissue) that are specialized for initiating impulses and conducting them rapidly through the heart (see the image below). They initiate the normal cardiac cycle and coordinate the contractions of cardiac chambers. For the heart to pump efficiently and the systemic and pulmonary circulations to operate in synchrony, the events in the cardiac cycle must be coordinated. Schematic illustration of the cardiac conduction system."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_kinds_of_tissues_make_up_the_cardiac_conduction_system", "passage_text": "Making the world better, one answer at a time. Cardiac muscle is a type of involuntary striated muscle found in the walls of the heart, particularly the myocardium. Cardiac muscle cells are identified as cardiac myocytes or cardiomyocytes. Cardiac muscle is one of three major types of muscle, the others being skeletal and smooth muscle. Cardiac muscle, different from skeletal muscle, is composed of separate cellular elements.
