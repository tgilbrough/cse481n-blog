What they will actually consume depends on where they live and the species of snail that they are. Some common items for their diet include plants, fruits, vegetables, and algae. Plants that are decaying are often a good meal for them. Seeking for calcium to get a thicker shell, snails usually will eat the dirt. Most snail species are herbivores, which means they have only a plant diet, but some species are carnivores or omnivores. You will likely find snails around your garden as this offers them plenty of fresh plants and leaves to eat."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grove_snail", "passage_text": "The grove snail or brown-lipped snail (Cepaea nemoralis) is a species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusc.

No doubt aided by human transport, this species is a good colonizer, and is often found in gardens, parks and abandoned land in cities. In Eastern Europe it occurs in urban areas.

Of all terrestrial molluscs, this species may well be the most widely known. The snail is relished as a food item in some areas, but it is also widely regarded as a pest in gardens and in agriculture, especially in regions where it has been introduced accidentally and where snails are not usually considered to be a menu item."}, {"url": "http://www.invadingspecies.com/invaders/invertebrates/invasive-snails/", "passage_text": "Invasive snails include a variety of gastropods invasive to areas of North America.

Brown Snakes are fairly small snakes, with a total body length of from 23 to 52.7 cm, though few Brown Snakes grow larger than 38 cm in length. They have stout bodies with large eyes and heavily keeled scales(with raised ridges along their length). Brown snakes feed largely on earthworms, snails, and slugs, but will also eat small salamanders, soft-bodied grubs, and beetles. They have specialized teeth and jaws that allow them to pull snails out of their shells and eat them. 1  Primary Diet. 2  carnivore. 3  molluscivore. 4  vermivore. 5  Animal Foods. 6  amphibians. 7  insects."}]
