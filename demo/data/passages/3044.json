Glycogenesis is activated when the body is in a state of rest or during high glucose level in the blood (due to high carbohydrate diet or due to diabetes) thus making insulin activate this process to reduce blood sugar level. Glycogen can be defined as a molecule of glucose that gets stored in the vital organs of the body like liver, muscle cells, brain and kidneys. This glycogen is released from the vital organs into the body only when the glucose in the blood (coming from the carbohydrates in a diet) gets used up for all the activities."}, {"url": "http://chemistry.elmhurst.edu/vchembook/604glycogenesis.html", "passage_text": "Glycogenesis: Glycogenesis is the formation of glycogen from glucose. Glycogen is synthesized depending on the demand for glucose and ATP (energy). If both are present in relatively high amounts, then the excess of insulin promotes the glucose conversion into glycogen for storage in liver and muscle cells. Glycogenesis, Glycogenolysis, and Gluconeogenesis. Biosynthesis of Glycogen: The goal of glycolysis, glycogenolysis, and the citric acid cycle is to conserve energy as ATP from the catabolism of carbohydrates. If the cells have sufficient supplies of ATP, then these pathways and cycles are inhibited."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeekhealth.com/what-is-glycogenesis.htm", "passage_text": "Glycogenesis is the body\u2019s way of storing glucose in the form of a polysaccharide called glycogen. This is a long chain of glucose molecules that can be compactly stored in cells. Part of the glycogenesis pathway includes the synthesis of the activated glucose that glycogen synthase uses to lengthen the chain. Glucose can move in and out of cells, but glucose-6-phosphate cannot. Thus, glucose is converted to glucose-6-phosphate."}, {"url": "http://www.innovateus.net/science/what-glycogenesis", "passage_text": "Before understanding the process of Glycogenesis, it is important to know what glycogen is essentially used for. Food gets assimilated in the body as glucose and gets released as energy to perform any kind of work or effort.
