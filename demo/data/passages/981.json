SO the conditions of your batteries on your new segway cannot be assessed here. I believe the owners manual says to charge the segway for 12 hours before using it. I suspect that many people do not do that. Typically, most of the charge goes into the batteries in 4 to 6 hours, the entire process takes about 8, with cell balancing. Of course, this all depends on how much charge is still in the batteries when you start to charge it... I've seen lots of information out there about how long the i2's battery LASTS, but no information about how long it takes to charge. As I am looking to buy a brand new i2 this coming Saturday, I'm wondering how long I can expect to have to let it charge before I can use it.
