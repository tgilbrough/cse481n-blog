The equivalent unit cost of an item equals the total cost divided by the equivalent units. If the total cost of the item was $2400, the unit cost would be $3 ($2400/800)."}, {"url": "http://classes.bus.oregonstate.edu/fall-06/ba422/Management%20Accounting%20Chapter%204.htm", "passage_text": "The first chart shows that fixed costs remain $50,000 at all production levels from 100 units to 1,000 units. The second chart shows that the fixed cost per unit decreases as production increases. Hence, when 100 units are manufactured, the fixed cost per unit is $500 ($50,000 100)."}, {"url": "http://www.unf.edu/~dtanner/dtch/dt_ch5.htm", "passage_text": "Step 4: Plug your answers to steps 2 and 3 into the cost formula by replacing the slope with the variable cost per unit and the Y-intercept with total fixed costs: Y = 44.25x + 2,900.
