For example the group of yellow flowers is a taxon. The group of primates is a taxon. The taxon of aquatic animals is a taxon. A clade is a monophyletic taxon or monophyletic group if you prefer. A monophyletic taxon (or a clade) is defined as a taxon that contains only all descendants of a common ancestor and the common ancestor. On the following picture, only the Taxon 1 is a clade. To cite few examples of clades: Primates, Eukaryotes, Rosacea, Reptilomorpha, Rodentia.
