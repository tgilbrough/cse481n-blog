It was a dominant school of psychology from the 1920s to 1960s. It is basically a psychological theory and related to the development of L1 acquisition or first language acquisition (FLA). Its importance lies in verbal behavior, and it received substantial attention from the pedagogical arena in the 1950s. Even though behaviorist and mentalist theories can be related to the social interactionist theory, the divisions of all three are different whereas social interactionist theory is social constructivist-where the acquisition of language has its roots in the earliest infant-caregiver conversations."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_behaviorist_view_of_language_acquisition", "passage_text": "The behaviorist view of language acquisition is that children learn language by receiving reinforcement from their parents after speaking correctly (operant conditioning). If a child's parents become ecstatic when the child says mama, the child will want to continue speaking to get the same positive reaction.

Watson, is actually a theory of native language learning, advanced in part as a reaction to traditional grammar. The supporters of this theory are Leonard Bloomfield, O.N. Mowrer, B.F. Skinner, and A.W. Staats. Other cases against this theory include \u201clearning the use and meaning of abstract words, evidence of novel forms of language not modeled by others, and uniformity of language acquisition in humans\u201d (Cooter & Reutzel, 2004)."}, {"url": "https://amnasabahat.wordpress.com/2012/06/19/crucial-differences-between-a-behaviorist-and-a-nativist-view-of-first-language-acquisition/", "passage_text": "Crucial differences between a behaviorist and a nativist view of first language acquisition.
