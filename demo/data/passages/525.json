They are attracted to a dead animal by the smell, and by seeing other scavengers. A familiar scavenger is the turkey vulture. These fascinating birds are very well adapted to their jobs, using their excellent sense of smell to find their food. Yuck!! The scavengers and decomposers help move energy through the food chain. Bacteria and fungi return it to the soil where plants can once again use it. (See the picture below.) Consumers use it as they eat the plants or the scavengers and decomposers.

They also break down the waste (poop) of other organisms. Decomposers are very important for any ecosystem. If they weren't in the ecosystem, the plants would not get essential nutrients, and dead matter and waste would pile up. There are two kinds of decomposers, scavengers and decomposers. Scavengers are animals that find dead animals or plants and eat them. While they eat them, they break them into small bits. In this simulation, flies, wasps and cockroaches are scavengers.
