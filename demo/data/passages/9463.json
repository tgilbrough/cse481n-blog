Small carbohydrates, like glucose or sucrose (table sugar) are composed of one or two sugar units, respectively, and are the molecules that give food a sweet taste. Plants store their energy by stringing together many glucose units into a long complex of several hundred to several thousand sugar (glucose) molecules. Plant foods that contain stored energy, for example seeds that must provide energy for the young plant when it starts growing, are high in starch."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101111083247AATzqKq", "passage_text": "They are formed from different basic elements.

To find the net carbs, you subtract the fiber from the total carbs to find net carbs. Sugar is the carbohydrate for quick energy and is also known as a simple carb.

Starch (a polymer of glucose) is used as a storage polysaccharide in plants, being found in the form of both amylose and the branched amylopectin. In animals, the structurally similar glucose polymer is the more densely branched glycogen, sometimes called 'animal starch'. Polysaccharides contain more than ten monosaccharide units.
