But the process of human fertilization is very complicated and comprised of many steps and components necessary to achieve the ultimate result of human life. Human fertilization is a very complicated process with many steps that take place in a short amount of time. Luckily, the definition is not as complicated as the process. Human fertilization is basically the fusion of the egg and sperm resulting in a zygote."}, {"url": "http://chickscope.beckman.uiuc.edu/explore/embryology/day05/ovary.html", "passage_text": "The free oocyte is guided by the infundibulum into the mouth of the hen's left oviduct.

The egg cell, or ovum, is the female reproductive cell (gamete) in oogamous organisms. The egg cell is typically not capable of active movement, and it is much larger (visible to the naked eye) than the motile sperm cells. When egg and sperm fuse, a diploid cell (the zygote) is formed, which gradually grows into a new organism"}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/oogenesis-how-the-female-reproductive-system-produces-eggs.html", "passage_text": "The Ovum. Oogenesis is the process by which the female gametes, or ova, are created. The female gamete is called an ovum. Sometimes people will refer to female gametes as eggs, but the term egg can include more than one stage of development, and the definition of an egg also changes depending on the type of organism. In this lesson, you'll learn how the human body produces an ovum through the process of oogenesis.
