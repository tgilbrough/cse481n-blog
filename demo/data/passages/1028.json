In larger amounts and in different forms, chromium can be toxic and carcinogenic. The most prominent example of toxic chromium is hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). Chromium is a chemical element with symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It is the first element in Group 6. It is a steely-gray, lustrous, hard and brittle metal which takes a high polish, resists tarnishing, and has a high melting point."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/209468-what-is-the-difference-between-chromium-chromium-picolinate/", "passage_text": "In nutrition, \u201cchromium\u201d refers to trivalent chromium, the form present in food and used by the body. Chromium picolinate is a supplemental form of trivalent chromium. Like many minerals, chromium is difficult to absorb. Binding it to an organic compound like picolinate may make chromium easier to absorb. Researchers are focused on understanding the potential role of chromium in insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Chromium picolinate, chromium chloride, chromium nicotinate and chromium citrate are types of chromium supplements. These can be purchased as individual supplements or as part of a multivitamin and mineral complex. Supplements generally provide anywhere between 50 micrograms and 200 micrograms of chromium per serving."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium(III)_picolinate", "passage_text": "Chromium (III) picolinate (CrPic 3) is a chemical compound sold as a nutritional supplement to treat type 2 diabetes and promote weight loss. This bright-red coordination compound is derived from chromium (III) and picolinic acid. Chromium has been identified to regulate insulin by increasing the sensitivity of the insulin receptor.
