Your urine is made by the kidneys and stored in the bladder. The kidneys act as a filter, draining the water and waste products from the blood and keeping the blood cells and larger protein molecules in the circulation. As urine also contains waste products from the blood, its colour is affected by what else is in the blood, such as foods and chemicals.

The phosphate urine test measures the amount of phosphate in a sample of urine collected over 24 hours (24-hour urine test). Phosphate is a charged particle (ion) that contains the mineral phosphorus. The body needs phosphorus to build and repair bones and teeth, help nerves function, and make muscles contract. If there is not enough phosphate, less is found in the urine. Kidney problems can cause high or low levels of phosphate in the urine. High levels of phosphate in the urine also may be caused by eating a meal high in phosphorus, having high levels of vitamin D in your body, or having an overactive parathyroid gland."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine", "passage_text": "Average urine production in adult humans is around 1.4 L of urine per person per day with a normal range of 0.6 to 2.6 L per person per day, produced in around 6 to 8 urinations per day depending on state of hydration, activity level, environmental factors, weight, and the individual's health.
