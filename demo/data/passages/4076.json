If you leave the psychopath, you can expect that he will either be the type who doesn't make any noise but ruins your reputation by spreading lies, or you can expect a lot of open manipulation (a final attempt to gain power and control)."}, {"url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10737827/Psychopaths-how-can-you-spot-one.html", "passage_text": "But for a small \u2013 but not that small \u2013 subset of the population, things are very different. These people lack remorse and empathy and feel emotion only shallowly. In extreme cases, they might not care whether you live or die. These people are called psychopaths.

This quiz is not meant to diagnose psychopathy or tell you definitively whether or not you're a psychopath. But it will give you a pretty good idea, based upon the research.

The psychopath may even claim he is sensitive and profound, but inside he is nothing but emptiness and greed. Most psychopaths are very arrogant and cocky. However, when charming a potential victim, they say all the right things and make you believe they are kind-hearted souls; not always, but often enough.
