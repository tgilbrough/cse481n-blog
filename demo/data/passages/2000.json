The fixed costs remain at \u00a3120,000 and the fixed cost per unit = 120,000 / 3,000 = \u00a340 per unit. The total cost of a unit at this level of activity is \u00a386 + \u00a340 = \u00a3126.

The cost per unit should decline as the number of units produced increases, primarily because the total fixed costs will be spread over a larger number of units (subject to the step costing issue noted above). Thus, the cost per unit is not constant. For example, ABC Company has total variable costs of $50,000 and total fixed costs of $30,000 in May, which it incurred while producing 10,000 widgets. The cost per unit is: ($30,000 Fixed costs + $50,000 variable costs) / 10,000 units = $8 cost per unit."}]
