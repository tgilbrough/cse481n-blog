When the electrical current flowing through the voice coil changes direction, the coil's polar orientation reverses. This changes the magnetic forces between the voice coil and the permanent magnet, moving the coil and attached diaphragm back and forth. In this way, the alternating current constantly reverses the magnetic forces between the voice coil and the permanent magnet. This pushes the coil back and forth rapidly, like a piston. When the coil moves, it pushes and pulls on the speaker cone."}, {"url": "http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/speaker6.htm", "passage_text": "The electromagnet is positioned in a constant magnetic field created by a permanent magnet.

The coil inside the magnet has alternating current running through it. The coil acts as an electromagnet and pulls itself up or pushes itself down moving the cone of the speaker. So the speaker cone will have something to be attracted to or push against, producing vibration which is then heard by your ears as sound. To a point anyway, the bigger the magnet the better the sound. There is a coil of wire at the smallest part of the speaker that acts as an electromagnet. Without the other magnet, there would be no movement of the speaker cone, therefore no sound. oklatom \u00b7 8 years ago"}]
