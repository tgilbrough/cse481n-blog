Though about 40% of these growths are benign, they can be cancerous, especially in older people and smokers. Many people with this condition don't have any symptoms, though some do have wheezing, shortness of breath, or a persistent cough. Medical professionals can examine chest X-rays for indications of lung nodules. Smokers are at a serious risk of developing lung nodules. A lung nodule is a mass of tissue located in the lungs. Cancerous lung nodules may be removed through a surgical procedure. Most lung nodules aren't found unless a person has a chest x-ray.

It is sometimes also called a spot on the lung or a coin lesion. Pulmonary nodules are generally smaller than 3 centimeters in diameter. If the growth is larger than that, it is known as a pulmonary mass. A mass is more likely to represent a cancer than is a nodule. Many are the result of inflammation in the lung as a result of an infection or disease producing inflammation in the body. The nodule may represent an active process or be the result of scar tissue formation related to prior inflammation.
