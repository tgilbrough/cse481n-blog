DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. Nearly every cell in a person\u2019s body has the same DNA. Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus (where it is called nuclear DNA), but a small amount of DNA can also be found in the mitochondria (where it is called mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). The structure of the double helix is somewhat like a ladder, with the base pairs forming the ladder\u2019s rungs and the sugar and phosphate molecules forming the vertical sidepieces of the ladder. An important property of DNA is that it can replicate, or make copies of itself."}, {"url": "https://dna.ancestry.com/", "passage_text": "AncestryDNA is the leader in DNA testing for family history and includes more than a million people who have taken the AncestryDNA test as well as the ability to access Ancestry, the world's largest online family history resource, which includes millions of family trees and over 15 billion historical records.
