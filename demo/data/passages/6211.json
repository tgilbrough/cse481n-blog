By law nothing can be added to spring water so we can deduce that any additives such as preservatives can be ruled out in causing an expiry problem.

Best Answer: It could be because the plastic of water cooler bottles is better and therefore the water lasts longer. The plastic which the one gallon milk bottle type bottles are made of is softer and will even allow the water to evaporate through the bottle after a time. The best kind of bottle for water storage is either glass or poly-carbonate. If you look on the bottom of the bottle a poly-carbonate has a #7 recycle sign. As a rule, the higher number is the best. But, as with most things, the fresher water is-the better. Another reason could be because it's too hard to put a best before date on bottles which are constantly re-used. "}]
