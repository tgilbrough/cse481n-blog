Large reserves of coal are therefore taken from the coal mines to the industries which are acres away from the mines. The petroleum is also taken to too far off power stations to produce energy. Fossil fuels are the highest producers of calorific value in terms of energy. This is also one of the reasons why they are still preferred over the renewable sources of energy or the alternative source"}, {"url": "http://benefitof.net/benefits-of-fossil-fuels/", "passage_text": "Benefits of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are basically the remains of animals and plants and these are good energy resources. The three main fossil fuels are natural gas, oil, and coal. Fossil fuels are low in cost and are very important resources for our economy. Fossil fuels are used to generate electricity used as fuels for transportation."}, {"url": "http://www.iptv.org/exploremore/energy/profiles/fossil_fuels.cfm", "passage_text": "Fossil fuels are energy resources that come from the remains of plants and animals. These remains are millions of years old. There are three fossil fuels: petroleum oil, natural gas, and coal. Fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and natural gas, provide the energy that powers our lifestyles and our economy. Fossil fuels power everything from the planes in the sky to the cars on the road. They heat our homes and light up the night. Theyre the bedrock we base our energy mix on."}, {"url": "http://www.alternativeenergysecret.com/fossil-fuels.html", "passage_text": "Advantages of Fossil Fuels. A major advantage of fossil fuels is their capacity to generate huge amounts of electricity in just a single location. Fossil fuels are very easy to find. When coal is used in power plants, they are very cost effective. Coal is also in abundant supply. Transporting oil and gas to the power stations can be made through the use of pipes making it an easy task. Disadvantages of Fossil Fuels Pollution is a major disadvantage of fossil fuels. This is because they give off carbon dioxide when burned thereby causing a greenhouse effect. This is also the main contributory factor to the global warming experienced by the earth today."}, {"url": "http://www.iptv.org/exploremore/energy/profiles/fossil_fuels.cfm", "passage_text": "Benefits One of the biggest benefits of fossil fuels is their cost. Coal, oil and natural gas are abundant right now and relatively inexpensive to drill or mine for. In fact, coal is the most plentiful fossil fuel and it is found over much of the world. Fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and natural gas, provide the energy that powers our lifestyles and our economy. Fossil fuels power everything from the planes in the sky to the cars on the road.

Easily Available: Since these fossil fuels have been of such a great source of energy, more and more extractions are going on every day. The geologists all around the world are trying to find out mines of coals. The pressure is even more as the population is increasing day by day.

These are the three main types of fossil fuels. You rely on fossil fuels every day for such tasks as fueling your car and heating your home. And, it's very likely that the electricity in your home comes from a power plant that uses fossil fuels. Let's review. Fossil fuels are sources of energy that formed from the accumulated remains of living organisms that were buried millions of years ago. Pressure, heat and time allow the organic matter to transform into one of the three major types of fossil fuels, which are coal, oil and natural gas."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-are-fossil-fuels-definition-advantages-disadvantages.html", "passage_text": "Fossil fuels are sources of energy that have developed within the earth over millions of years.
