Wing loading of parachutes is measured similarly to that of aircraft, comparing exit weight to area of parachute fabric.

Parachutes are usually made out of light, strong cloth, originally silk, now most commonly nylon. Depending on the situation, parachutes are used with a variety of loads, including people, food, equipment, space capsules, and bombs.

In addition to the fabric canopy, a parachute designed to be used by a person must be equipped with a harness that is worn by the user.

One is a dome canopy made of fabric in a shape that ranges from a hemisphere to a cone; the canopy traps air inside its envelope, creating a region of high pressure that retards movement in the direction opposite the entering air flow. In addition to the fabric canopy, a parachute designed to be used by a person must be equipped with a harness that is worn by the user.

Running or speed parachutes are gaining popularity with a host of athletes. The nylon parachutes attach to a harness around your waist or your chest and then expand as you speed up. As the chute expands, it creates drag, forcing you to work harder which, in turn, builds overall strength. Runners using parachutes create wind resistance even on a day when it isn't windy at all"}, {"url": "http://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/age14-16/Mechanics/Motion/text/Parachutes_/index.html", "passage_text": "Parachutes can be guided by letting some of the air spill out of the front or back of the parachute. There is also a hole in the middle to allow the parachute to fall vertically. Parachutes can be circular, the traditional shape, or rectangular the shape used for some military and stunt use.

Believe it or not, some airplanes use parachutes as well. For some, the function is a lot like a drag racer. This is ideal for areas with limited runways, such as an aircraft carrier's deck. There also are some aircraft that use a parachute recovery system to protect them from crashes. Space Travel. Parachutes don't have much use in a vacuum because they require air to actually function; yet, the Apollo capsule was equipped with one. NASA uses parachutes for a similar reason that some airplanes do, for recovery."}]
