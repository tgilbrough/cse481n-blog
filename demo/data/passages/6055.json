In the last 60 years, brown tree snakes have become the embodiment of the bad things that can happen when invasive species are introduced in places where they have few predators. Unchecked for many years, the snakes caused the extinction of nearly every native bird species on the Pacific island of Guam. \u201cThe brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species, but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snake\u2019s indirect effects,\u201d said Haldre Rogers, a UW doctoral student in biology."}, {"url": "http://earthsky.org/earth/lifeform-of-the-week-brown-tree-snakes-slithering-pariahs-of-the-pacific-islands", "passage_text": "The brown tree snake (BTS) is the quintessential invasive species. Since finding its way to the U.S. territory of Guam in the mid-20th Century, it has wiped out most of the island\u2019s native bird species and continues to devour lizards and small mammals at an alarming rate. And with no native snake species to compete with, the brown tree snake had the buffet table all to itself. Population control of the BTS in its native range results from a more limited and elusive food supply."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_tree_snake", "passage_text": "The brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) is an arboreal rear-fanged colubrid snake native to eastern and northern coastal Australia, eastern Indonesia (Sulawesi to Papua), Papua New Guinea, and a large number of islands in northwestern Melanesia. Another possible negative outcome of introducing species as a control method for the brown tree snake population is predation on juvenile cane toads and red-bellied snakes by brown tree snakes themselves, because they are opportunistic and generalist feeders."}, {"url": "http://www.columbia.edu/itc/cerc/danoff-burg/invasion_bio/inv_spp_summ/boiga_irregularis.html", "passage_text": "Site and Date of Introduction: The brown tree snake was introduced into Guam in the 1950s. The snake was first sighted inland from the seaport and became conspicuous throughout central Guam by the 1960s. By 1968, brown tree snakes had successfully dispersed throughout the island. Reason(s) Why it has Become Established: The brown tree snake has become established on Guam due to the absence of natural population controls and the abundance of vulnerable prey on the island. For example, introduced lizards are popular food items for young snakes."}, {"url": "http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/wildlife_damage/content/printable_version/fs_brown_tree_snake_2011.pdf", "passage_text": "The brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) was accidentally introduced to Guam in the late 1940s or early 1950s, probably from the Solomon Islands.

In 1993 a brown tree snake was found in Corpus Christi, Texas in a shipment of cargo from Guam (McCoid et al. 1994). As of 2010, this species is not reported in Texas. The brown tree snake is an effective predator of small vertebrates, including birds and lizards. The brown tree snake has decimated bird populations in Guam.
