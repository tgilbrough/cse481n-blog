If you have a low credit score, you can still qualify to obtain DirecTV services, they will just require a deposit be made. The deposit can range from anywhere between $50 and $300 depending on the entertainment package you want and what your score is. After a specified period of time, with your account in good standing, you will be refunded all of your deposit. A low credit score is considered to be in the mid-500s range. Though there is no requirement for a minimum credit score, you are likely to get approved and pay a smaller deposit if your score is over 580. This does not, however, include the cost of installation."}, {"url": "http://www.askmefast.com/What_credit_score_does_directv_require_for_no_deposit-qna832100.html", "passage_text": "After that get a credit card and find out what day they report to the credit company.

I am trying to get Directv again after 4 1/2 years of Dish Network. I left both Dish and Directv with my account fully paid and in good standing. Now, I am being told by Directv that I need to post a deposit of about $280 as well as some extra receiver fees after my credit check, and I was told Directv uses Experian. So, for the first time, I decided to pay for my credit score to see if there was a problem"}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090122151226AAIBsYz", "passage_text": "Report Abuse. They dont. They use it to see if you need to pay a deposit. If you have good credit they dont need a deposit. If bad, then $200. The reason being, they bring equipment that totals around a $1000. They want to make sure you pay for this in their contract. Also, if you pay on time for the first 3 months, they credit your account with the $200.

Yeah, it\u2019s annoying but it\u2019s an important step for DIRECTV since they provide customers with a bunch of free equipment and dishes (not to mention the free installation). There\u2019s no hard and fast number, but if your score is over 570, you probably won\u2019t have to pay a deposit and will qualify for every promotion going. If you\u2019re under 570, they may ask you to provide a deposit of anywhere from $50-$200, depending on the type of package and receiver you\u2019re interested in. Keep in mind that\u2019s a deposit not a fee so it\u2019ll be applied to your upcoming bills.
