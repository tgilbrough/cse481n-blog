Many brands of urethane paint are available to consumers today. Advantages. Urethane paint was first created in the mid-1960s, utilizing the newly-developed plastics technology of that era, to be superior to enamel paint in terms of durability. It also has the advantage of being a surface that can be applied over enamel if the enamel-painted surface is prepared first."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/about_4618228_polyurethane-paint.html", "passage_text": "Choosing a Polyurethane. Polyurethane is applied with a brush to flat surfaces and with a cloth to contoured surfaces. The aerosol spray form is used for hard-to-reach areas. The paint is available in a gloss, semi-gloss and satin finish."}, {"url": "http://www.carsdirect.com/car-maintenance/urethane-car-paint-understanding-the-pros-and-cons", "passage_text": "However, most pros will tell you that lacquer shouldn't be sprayed over urethane paint. Since lacquer paints are more expensive than urethane paints, consider getting your car painted with urethane paints. Urethane is also better than enamel paint, since it provides a good finish and doesn't run lines. Apart from this, urethane paint dries off quickly; it's resistant to chipping and doesn't fade easily. If the car exteriors are maintained well, urethane car paints will last for more than 10 years.

To add durability without affected color, use a water-based finish. Essentially a plastic in the form of a liquid until it dries, polyurethane is available in both water-and oil-based options, and comes in varieties from satin to glossy. Water-based polyurethane is popular because of its low odor and low toxicity."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-polyurethane.htm", "passage_text": "Polyurethane is a resilient, flexible and durable manufactured material that can take the place of paint, cotton, rubber, metal or wood in thousands of applications across virtually all fields. It can be hard like fiberglass, squishy like upholstery foam, protective like varnish, bouncy like rubber or sticky like glue.

Use this type of paint to protect a variety of craft projects, including decoupage and woodcraft, from scratches and dents. Polyurethane paint comes in three types: water-based, oil-based and oil-modified water-based. Polyurethane is applied with a brush to flat surfaces and with a cloth to contoured surfaces.
