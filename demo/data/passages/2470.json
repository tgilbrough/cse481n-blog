Bedsheets are generally made from pima cotton. When quilting through pima cotton, it is very difficult to needle this fabric. This is the main reason NOT to use bedsheets to back quilts. A looser weave fabric can be an even bigger problem, since you may only be catching 1 or 2 thread when you hand quilt."}, {"url": "http://www.nordstromsupplier.com/NPG/PDFs/Product%20Integrity/Labeling%20Requirements/Textile%20Fiber%20Labeling.pdf", "passage_text": "Example: 100% TENCEL \u00ae LYOCELL If using a trade name, it is important that you have legal documentation that the product is manufactured by the company with the registered trademark.

The future of recycled PET polyester seems to lie in making the recycling process more economically efficient, and in making finer-diameter yarns. It is a two-sided pile material, meaning that both the front and back surface of the fabric sprouts a layer of cut fibers, similar to corduroy or velvet. Polyester fleece is an extremely durable fabric that not only holds in warmth but resists moisture and dries quickly."}, {"url": "http://www.hoovers.com/industry-facts.textile-manufacturing.1407.html", "passage_text": "Yarns and thread are used to produce fabrics that are woven or knit, finish fabrics by dyeing or coating them, and make fabrics into simple finished consumer products like rugs, carpets, curtains, linens, and textile bags.

The PolarTEC\u2122 Series is a porch-style thermoelectric module (TEM). The hot side ceramic has an extended edge, which allows for a strong lead attachment to accommodate the wiring of multiple TEMs into an array. This product line is available in 4, 6 and 8 Amp configurations and is ideal for high volume production. Assembled with Bismuth Telluride semiconductor material and thermally conductive Aluminum Oxide ceramics, the PolarTEC\u2122 Series is designed for higher current and larger heat-pumping applications. For all PolarTEC\u2122 Series modules, wire is stranded, 152 mm (6.0 in.) long and PVC insulated."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_polartec_fabric", "passage_text": "Actually, Polyester is a fabric content. If a fabric content is 100% polyester then the polyester you can call it fabric. I hope can help you. Technically, polyester is a m \u2026 aterial from which fabrics are made. It is a synthetic or man made material which can be fabricated into a multitude of woven and knit fabrics. It can also be blended with natural materials like cotton and then fabricated into fabrics. 2 people found this useful. Bedsheets are generally made from pima cotton.
