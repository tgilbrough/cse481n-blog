You need to be careful here: You don\u2019t just stick a heating pad under the tank, turn it on, and ignore it. It needs to be small enough to provide heat to only part of the floor, under part of the hidey-home. The idea is to provide what is called a \u201cheat gradient\u201d. Let\u2019s say, for example, that the ideal temperature for your snake is 30C. Another spot on the floor under the hidey-home should be a little warmer, at 31C, and still another should be 28C or 29C. Yet another section of the floor outside the hidey-hole, should be as cool as 22C-24C, and unheated."}, {"url": "http://exoticpets.about.com/od/othersnakes/p/greensnakes.htm", "passage_text": "Names: Scientific Names: the rough green snake is Opheodrys aestivus, and the smooth green snake is Opheodrys vernalis. Common Names: these snakes are sometimes called by a variety of other names, such as grass snakes, green whip snakes, garden snakes, vine snakes, and keeled green snakes. This can lead to much confusion (for example the term grass snake is also used for the European grass snake, Natrix natrix). These are small snakes so do not need a huge tank, but do need vertical space for climbing (even the more terrestrial smooth green snake). A 30 gallon is a good choice because it provides lots of space for greenery and hiding spots."}, {"url": "http://www.maine.gov/ifw/wildlife/human/lww_information/snakes.html", "passage_text": "Snakes are among the most misunderstood of all animals.
