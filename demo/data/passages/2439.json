Lymph nodes are small lymphoid organs distributed throughout the body at specific locations and connected to other nearby nodes by lymphatic vessels carrying lymph fluid. A node consists of two main regions cortex (long left arrow) and medullar (arrowhead). The blood vessels and efferent lymphatic channel pass through hilum (bottom arrow). The primary function of lymph node is to respond to non-self antigens and generate antigen-specific soluble antibodies from mature plasma cells.

Several afferent vessels carry lymph into the nodes and enter the e \u2026 fferent vessels to carry lymph away from the nodes. Because there are more afferent than efferent vessels, the passage of lymph through the sinuses are slowed down, allowing time for the cleansing process. 17 people found this useful. A lymph vessel. They are similar in function to blood vessels. However the lymph is moved along the vessel by muscle contractions rather than by the heart pumping. 1 person"}, {"url": "http://en.wikivet.net/Lymphatic_Vessels_-_Anatomy_%26_Physiology", "passage_text": "Tissue fluid is collected by the afferent lymphatic vessels which drain into the lymph node where trapping of foreign material occurs to prevent spread around the body. The filtered lymph leaves the lymph node via the efferent lymphatic vessel. The smaller vessels generally travel with blood vessels and nerves. Valves in the vessels prevent back flow and keep the flow of lymph unidirectional. As there is no central pump the movement of lymph is largely dependant on skeletal muscular activity."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/lymph-nodes-anatomy-location-quiz.html", "passage_text": "The lymph node is covered by a tough capsule, which is penetrated in multiple places by lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic vessels attached to the outer rim of a lymph node (the side opposite the hilum) are called afferent lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic vessels emerging from the hilum are called efferent lymphatic vessels. Each lymph node possesses many afferent vessels, but usually only one or two efferent vessels. The lymph flowing into a lymph node carries with it the bacteria, viruses, cancer cells, debris, and other potentially dangerous agents that have filtered into the lymphatic vessels from your bloodstream and tissues. Lymph enters a lymph node through an afferent lymphatic vessel."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/lymph-nodes-anatomy-location-quiz.html", "passage_text": "Throughout the lymph node's interior are a series of street-like channels called sinuses that help guide the flow of lymph from the afferent lymphatic vessels, through the cortex and medulla, and finally to the efferent lymphatic vessels at the hilum.
