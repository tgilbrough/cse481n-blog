Dihydrogen monoxide or DHMO, also known as Hydrogen Hydroxide or Hydronium Hydroxide is one of the most prolific chemicals contacted in daily life. It is colorless, odorless and tasteless, and sometimes considered harmless, and yet kills very large numbers of humans every year. Yet, most unknowing victims consider DHMO vital to life. Absence of DHMO can lead to famine, renal failure and disease. It is used daily for food preparation and is present in most kitchens and bathrooms. It has been called the elixir of life. It is also vital to our existence, without DHMO we would be all dead."}, {"url": "http://staffweb.mps.k12.mi.us/reinhardtbp/.2Chemdocs/Unit%204B/DHMO%20facts.pdf", "passage_text": "What is Dihydrogen Monoxide?

Dihydrogen monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and kills uncounted thousands of people every year. Most of these deaths are caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO, but the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide do not end there. Prolonged exposure to its solid form causes severe tissue damage."}]
