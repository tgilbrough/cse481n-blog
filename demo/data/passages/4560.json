A syrinx is described as a fluid-filled hollow space within the cord, which sometimes expands and spreads in both length and width, slowly destroying the spinal cord. Not all syrinxes are problematic, although all present risk factors for future catastrophic health concerns if they do grow larger or longer. When a syrinx occurs, this cavity is abnormally filled with cerebral spinal fluid, expanding the space inside the spinal cord. A true syrinx is located at an interior location of the cord which is not lined with protective ependymal cells."}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/syringomyelia", "passage_text": "Syringomyelia is a rare disorder in which a cyst forms within your spinal cord. As the cyst, which is called a syrinx, expands and lengthens over time, it compresses and damages part of your spinal cord from its center outward. Damage to the spinal cord caused by a syrinx can cause symptoms like progressive pain, stiffness, and weakness in the back, shoulders, arms, and legs. Individuals with the disorder might lose the ability to feel cold and pain normally. Symptoms of the disorder are caused by the pressure the syrinx puts on the spinal cord and the damage that follows. The symptoms may include: 1  progressive weakness and pain in back, shoulders, arms, or legs. 2  inability to feel hot or cold normally."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringomyelia", "passage_text": "Syringomyelia /s\u026a\u02ccr\u026a\u014b\u0261\u0275ma\u026a\u02c8i\u02d0li\u0259/ is a generic term referring to a disorder in which a cyst or cavity forms within the spinal cord.
