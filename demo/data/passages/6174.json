It is an important component of fertilizers, explosives, food preservatives, propellants and toothpaste for sensitive teeth. A concentrated solution of potassium nitrate speeds up decomposition of vegetable matter such as tree stumps.

Potassium occurs naturally in bananas, and is essential to plant growth. It comes as a powder, and is silvery in color. Answer 2 Poassium, being a highly reactive element, \u2026 does not occur naturally. It is always in combination with something. As the first answer says, it's found in bananas (and a lot of other things), but not as pure potassium."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/205049-what-are-some-natural-sources-of-potassium-nitrate/", "passage_text": "Potassium nitrate is also called saltpeter and nitrite. It is commonly used to make gun powder and minor explosives, for curing meats and used medically for wounds (when combined with other chemicals).

It is an ionic salt of potassium ions K + and nitrate ions NO 3 \u2212 . It occurs as a mineral niter and is a natural solid source of nitrogen. Potassium nitrate is one of several nitrogen-containing compounds collectively referred to as saltpeter or saltpetre. Major uses of potassium nitrate are in fertilizers, tree stump removal, rocket propellants and fireworks. It is one of the major constituents of gunpowder (blackpowder) and has been used since the Middle Ages as a food preservative."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-salt-peter.htm", "passage_text": "Salt peter typically refers to the chemical compound potassium nitrate, though it may also refer to sodium nitrate. Salt peter was once collected from decomposing material, but today, it is generally manufactured by treating sodium nitrate, mostly mined in Chile, with potassium chloride and collecting the precipitate. Salt peter is also used as a fertilizer and as a stump remover, as it accelerates the decomposition process of tree stumps. Salt peter can be found in many everyday products as well. It is used to preserve some foods, most commonly meats, although there are concerns about its health effects."}, {"url": "http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/saltpeter/index.html", "passage_text": "In the non-food world, it's utilized for fireworks, gunpowder, as a component in fertilizer and so on. 2.
