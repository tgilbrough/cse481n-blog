Ethane-1,2-diamine (shown in the image) is an example of a bidentate ligand. Both of the nitrogens in this molecule can act as electron donors, binding with a central metal atom or ion. When H 2 0 is a ligand, oxygen is the donor atom binding to the metal. When NH 3 is a ligand, nitrogen is the donor atom binding to the metal.

The bonding between metal and ligand generally involves formal donation of one or more of the ligand's electron pairs. Metals and metalloids are bound to ligands in virtually all circumstances, although gaseous naked metal ions can be generated in high vacuum. Ligands in a complex dictate the reactivity of the central atom, including ligand substitution rates, the reactivity of the ligands themselves, and redox."}, {"url": "http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/geneFamily/endogenousligands", "passage_text": "Genes in this family provide instructions for making specialized proteins called endogenous ligands. A ligand is a protein that attaches (binds) to another protein called a receptor; receptor proteins have specific sites into which the ligands fit like keys into locks. Endogenous ligands are those that are produced in the body, not those introduced into the body, such as certain drugs.

Ligand can be an anion, cation or a neutral molecule. Neutral ligands must have a lone pair of electrons which can be donated to the metal atom or ion to form complexes. A ligand can be defined as a specific substance that is capable of binding and forming a thermodynamically stable complex with other bio molecules through either ionic and hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals forces to perform a specific biologically important function."}, {"url": "http://www.chemicool.com/definition/ligand.html", "passage_text": "Tridentate ligands have three atoms capable of binding to a central metal atom or ion.
