Noises may be a variety of brake and brake mounting systems failures, or they may be other problems that occur when the motion of braking creates movement in another part. A clunking or banging noise may be audible when applying brakes on a car. Harder braking creates a louder noise at higher speeds. This can be a failure of steering parts like the rack-and-pinion steering on a front-wheel-drive vehicle or tie rod ends on a rear-wheel-drive vehicle."}, {"url": "http://www.aa1car.com/library/tr996.htm", "passage_text": "Fortunately, brake noise is not caused by a virus. It is caused by a combination of factors that sometimes add up to create noise. Brake squeal is really a high frequency vibration. In disc brakes, it can be caused by vibrations between the pads and rotors, the pads and calipers, or the calipers and their mounts. In the photo above, the noise produced by a brake rotor in a test lab has been captured electronically and converted into a color graphic. SHAKY PADS CAN CAUSE DISC BRAKE NOISE. One way to quiet noisy pads is to make sure the pads fit tightly in the calipers. If the pads on a single piston caliper have mounting ears or tabs that need to be bent or hammered to hold the pad in position, make sure the pad can't be wiggled by hand."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/list_5954830_three-types-brake-noises.html", "passage_text": "Shocks and springs can cause a clunking noise when braking if they are loose or broken. At times, these suspension parts can benefit from an adjustment or they may need replacing. Calipers that hold the disc brake pads in place may be out of adjustment, which will cause clunking.
