Humans and other apes are descended from a common ancestor whose population split to become two (and more) lineages. The question is rather like asking, If many Americans and Australians are descended from Europeans, why are there still Europeans around?. Apes are still around because humans evolved into humans as we are now and apes evolved into different apes better suited to their environments. thats why there are so many different types of apes, from gorilla to marmasett. jonny Atlantis \u00b7 9 years ago."}, {"url": "http://www.livescience.com/32503-why-havent-all-primates-evolved-into-humans.html", "passage_text": "View full size image.

Human and chimp DNA is so similar because the two species are so closely related. Humans, chimps and bonobos descended from a single ancestor species that lived six or seven million years ago. As humans and chimps gradually evolved from a common ancestor, their DNA, passed from generation to generation, changed too. In fact, many of these DNA changes led to differences between human and chimp appearance and behavior. \u00a9 AMNH Exhibitions."}, {"url": "http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/evolution/humans-descended-from-apes.htm", "passage_text": "One of the most persistent myths, however, concerns the relationship of humans to great apes, a group of primates that includes the gorilla, orangutan and chimpanzee. Someone who believes the myth will say, If evolution exists, then humans must be descended directly from apes. That's not to say humans and apes aren't related, but the relationship can't be traced backward along a direct line of descent, one form morphing into another. It must be traced along two independent lines, far back into time until the two lines merge."}, {"url": "https://answersingenesis.org/genetics/dna-similarities/what-about-the-similarity-between-human-and-chimp-dna/", "passage_text": "This, of course, does not mesh with Genesis 1\u20132.
