Most students were 22 and 23, but that was set off by the non-traditionals in the class who were in their 30s.

Applying to medical school is a highly competitive process, where the demand is much greater than the number of available seats in U.S. schools. The odds are even higher for nontraditional students.

An AAMC fact card shows that the average medical school graduate owes more than $176,000, equaling a repayment of $328,000, assuming a three-year residency and standard 10-year payoff. Repayment, if extended, could cost upward of $400,000 or more, according to the AAMC example."}]
