The sciatic nerve is the largest single nerve in the body and is composed of individual nerve roots that start by branching out from the spine in the lower back and combine to form the sciatic nerve.. 1  The sciatic nerve starts in the lower back at lumbar segment 3 (L3). The specific sciatica symptoms-the leg pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, and possibly symptoms that radiate into the foot-largely depend on where the nerve is pinched. For example, a lumbar segment 5 (L5) nerve impingement can cause weakness in extension of the big toe and potentially in the ankle."}, {"url": "http://www.spine-health.com/conditions/spine-anatomy/sciatic-nerve-anatomy", "passage_text": "In the lower thigh/above the back of the knee, the sciatic nerve divides into two nerves, the tibial and peroneal nerves, which innervate different parts of the lower leg: 1  Peroneal nerves. 2  The peroneal nerves travel laterally (sideways) along the outer part of the knee and down into the upper foot.
