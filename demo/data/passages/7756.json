Each parent nuclide spontaneously decays into a daughter nuclide (the decay product) via an \u03b1 decay or a \u03b2\u2212 decay.

Many granites or other igneous rocks contain some radioactivity because of minor, but highly radioactive, accessory minerals. re = mineral density (S Atomic number / Molecular Weight) where re is the electron density in grams/cc. Definition. Radioactivity in minerals are caused by the inclusion of naturally-occurring radioactive elements in the mineral's composition. The degree of radioactivity is dependent on the concentration and isotope present in the mineral. For the most part, minerals that contain potassium (K), uranium (U), and thorium (Th) are radioactive. This table lists all of the naturally-occurring radioactive isotopes. Mineral radioactivity is due to alpha, beta, and gamma radiation from the unstable isotopes in the composition"}, {"url": "http://physics.isu.edu/radinf/natural.htm", "passage_text": "They are even found in us, being that we are products of our environment.

If we know the number of radioactive parent atoms present when a rock formed and the number present now, we can calculate the age of the rock using the decay constant. 1 The oldest rocks on Earth, found in western Greenland, have been dated by four independent radiometric dating methods at 3.7-3.8 billion years. 2  Rocks 3.4-3.6 billion years in age have been found in southern Africa, western Australia, and the Great Lakes region of North America."}, {"url": "http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/geotopics/earth_age.html", "passage_text": "Age of the Earth. Scientists determined the Earth's age using a technique called radiometric dating. Radiometric dating is based upon the fact that some forms of chemical elements are radioactive, which was discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel and his assistants, Marie and Pierre Curie. The discovery gave scientists a tool for dating rocks that contain radioactive elements. (The nucleus of an atom is made up of protons and neutrons.) For example, the element carbon, which always has six protons in its nucleus, has three isotopes: one with six neutrons in the nucleus, one with seven, and one with eight.
