Waxy starches (maize, rice, sorghum, barley) have no amylose and contain essentially 100% amylopectin. The first example of a waxy wheat starch has recently been reported from Japan. High-amylose starches (maize, barley) having 50-70% amylose are available. Waxy and high-amylose starches differ from normal starches in some properties that make them of use in certain food products."}, {"url": "http://www.cargillfoods.com/lat/en/products/starches-dextrins/index.jsp", "passage_text": "The starches most used in food industry are extracted from cereals (corn, wheat and rice) or roots and tubers (cassava and potato). In addition to the nutritional value, starches are used to change the properties of many other foods. They are used as gelling and thickening agents, and also in adherence, retention of humidity, stabilization and texturization, among other applications."}, {"url": "http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0395e/T0395E03.htm", "passage_text": "Starch.

In common maize, with either the dent or flint type of endosperm, amylose makes up 25 to 30 percent of the starch and amylopectin makes up 70 to 75 percent.
