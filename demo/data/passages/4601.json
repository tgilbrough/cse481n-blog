Glands of the body are classified as either exocrine or endocrine types. Exocrine glands are glands that retain ducts to body surfaces. During development, endocrine glands lose their contacts to embryological surfaces(ducts) and become isolated as small blocks of tissues. In exocrine glands, products of these cells collect in the duct of the gland and flow toward the surface to which the duct is in contact. Since endocrine glands lack ducts, the product is released across the cell membrane into interstitial spaces around the cells. Diffusion of the product into capillaries follows."}, {"url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0022074/", "passage_text": "Exocrine Glands.

Exocrine glands secrete their hormones into a duct that leaves the body externally: for example, sweat glands empty onto the skin. Endocrine gland secretes compounds (hormones) into the blood. Exocrine gland secretes compounds outside of the body (including into the GI tract since the GI tract is topologically outside of the body). Exocrine glands have ducts that carry their secretory product to a surface. These glands include the sweat, sebaceous, and mammary glands and, the glands that secrete digestive enzymes.The endocrine glands do not have ducts to carry their product to a surface."}]
