Hawaii's famous Kilauea volcano emerged from the sea more than 50,000 years ago, and it has been active ever since. Kilauea, formed from an intraplate hot spot, is the most studied volcano in the world. Composed mostly of lava flows, Kilauea also has some deposits from explosive eruptions. It has erupted from three main areas: its summit and two rift zones. Most of Kilauea's eruptions are relatively gentle lava flows.

Most of the igneous rocks we see on the surface were born inside the Earth millions of years ago. But new igneous rock is forming all the time. Hawaii's Kilauea volcano is a great place to see this process in action. In this activity, you'll go on a virtual tour of Kilauea.

The volcano began the longest rift-zone eruption in historic times on January 3, 1983. Lava fountains formed in the rift zone about ten miles below the summit caldera. Powerful eruptions threw molten rock high in the air building a cinder cone. Big Island volcanoes. The Big Island of Hawaii was created by five volcanoes: Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, Kilauea, Kohala Volcano and Hualalai Volcano.The tallest volcanoes in the Pacfic Ocean are Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa.

It emits sulphur dioxide and thus produces a desert effect in the Kilauea region. The lava is basalt. Mount Kilauea formed as a Shield Volcano, as the Pacific plate moved over a geological hot spot magma broke through the crust of the earth and formed a set of volcanic mountains on the sea floor. The tops of these mountains are now the Hawaiian islands. 9 people found this useful."}]
