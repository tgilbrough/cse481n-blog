Ribs cooked on a grill, especially a gas grill, will not be as tender even cooked indirectly. To make your ribs tenderer you can precook by either boiling the ribs for about 30 minutes or by placing them in a slow cooker. This will get the ribs going and not dried out. Once you are ready to grill then you can season the ribs and cook them indirectly until done. Remember, if you boil, slow cook, or oven roast ribs it must be at a low temperature, around 200 to 225 degrees F. Now when it comes to seasoning ribs you want to be very conservative. Good ribs have a great flavor all to themselves. It is also important to avoid adding barbecue sauce to ribs early in the process."}, {"url": "http://meatified.com/how-to-cook-ribs-in-the-oven/", "passage_text": "When the ribs are fork tender, all you need to do is remove them from the foil (save those juices for stock or soup later!) and put them on a baking tray. If your ribs are about 3 lbs, they\u2019ll take about 3 hours 15 minutes and a 4 lb rack will take closer to 4 1/2 hours. Roughly speaking, they need to have at least 1 hour in the oven per pound, with about 15 \u2013 30 minutes extra to make sure they\u2019re super tender."}, {"url": "http://www.mcraigweaver.com/recipes/ribs.stm", "passage_text": "The trick to great ribs is to cook them very slowly with the BBQ sauce on them. You can do this in an oven, just set the temperature to 225\u00b0 F (about 107\u00b0 C). I occasionally use an electric smoker, which cooks at about 200 to 225 degrees Fahrenheit. I've also used this method on my gas grill and in my oven. Cook the ribs for 4\u00bd to 5 hours. The time it takes you to cook the ribs may vary depending on the true temperature of your grill, oven, or smoker, the temperature of the ribs when you start, and other factors."}, {"url": "http://www.thesmokerking.com/page1b.html", "passage_text": "1. Remove the ribs from the refrigerator about 45 minutes before cooking them so they are closer to room temperature.

The best method is to sauce one side of the ribs, close the lid and cook for 5 minutes. Then open the lid, flip the ribs and sauce the other side. Do this for 30 minutes and you will have a heavy coating of barbecue sauce.

Ribs are among the cuts of meat that contain lots of connective tissue, along with the regualr meat and fat. But if you're using a slow cooker/crockpot, cut the rack/racks of ribs into sets of 1 or 2 bones, apply your flavoring, and cook them in the slow cooker (on LOW setting) for anywhere from 6 to 8 hours. The time will vary depending on the type of cooker you're using, and also on the size & quantity of ribs."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_do_you_cook_boneless_pork_ribs_in_the_oven", "passage_text": "Place meat in large baking dish in about one inch of water (or halfway each rib).

If you take them up to 180\u00b0F, drop the oven temp to about 180\u00b0F and hold them at this temp for about 30 minutes, the collagens and fats melt some more at this temp and make the meat more tender and juicy. On most cookers, when the oven temp is 225\u00b0F at sea level, it takes about three to four hours to cook a slab of baby backs and about five to six hours to cook a slab of St. Louis cut ribs or spares. They are slightly undercooked at that stage."}]
