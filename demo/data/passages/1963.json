It is the base of the genetic variability of different biological systems in space. Genetic variation is based on the variation in alleles of genes in a gene pool. It occurs both within and among populations, supported by individual carriers of the variant genes. Genetic variation is brought about by random mutation, which is a permanent change in the chemical structure of a gene. Mutations are likely to be rare and most mutations are neutral or deleterious, but in some instances the new alleles can be favored by natural selection. Polyploidy is an example of chromosomal mutation. Polyploidy is a condition wherein organisms have three or more sets of genetic variation (3n or more)."}, {"url": "http://www.ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=geneticvariation", "passage_text": "Genetic variation refers to diversity in gene frequencies. Genetic variation can refer to differences between individuals or to differences between populations.

Mutations in genes can either have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning properly or completely. Mutations can also occur in nongenic regions. 1 A neutral mutation has no harmful or beneficial effect on the organism. 2  Such mutations occur at a steady rate, forming the basis for the molecular clock. 3  In the neutral theory of molecular evolution, neutral mutations provide genetic drift as the basis for most variation at the molecular level."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/genetic-variability-and-random-mutation.html", "passage_text": "Random mutations are a critical component of evolution because mutations create genetic variation within a population. If a mutation is harmful, it will likely be weeded out very quickly, because any change in the population that makes an organism less 'fit' will ultimately lead to its demise. Sometimes though, variations occur within a population because of random mutations, which are changes in the nucleotide sequence of DNA.
