Exposure to a dim light at night, such as the glow of a TV screen, may prompt changes in the brain that lead to mood disorders, including depression, according to a new study in hamsters. A patient with major depression has a smaller hippocampus, Bedrosian said. The brain changes in the hamsters might arise from fluctuations in the production of the hormone melatonin, Bedrosian said. Melatonin signals to the body that it's nighttime, but a light at night dampens its production."}, {"url": "http://psycheducation.org/treatment/bipolar-disorder-light-and-darkness/", "passage_text": "Using light and darkness as treatment (less med\u2019s!). Much of the information on this page is new research, not yet repeated by other scientists (it is always a good sign in this business if someone can repeat the study and get the same results!). What\u2019s new is that you can prevent this reduction in melatonin by blocking blue light, with a simple pair of glasses made to block that particular color of light. They let everything else through. Things look pretty yellow through these things, but to your brain, it\u2019s like darkness!

The intensity of light could also have an impact on the intensity of our emotions, a new study suggests. Research published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology shows that the more intense the lighting, the greater a person's emotions -- both positive and negative. Researchers noted that the bright light's ability to make people feel warmer could have something to do with increasing the intensity of their emotions. We suggest that these effects arise because light underlies perception of heat, and perception of heat can trigger the hot emotional system, the study said."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/depression/features/seasonal-affective-disorder", "passage_text": "Many things, including brain chemicals, ions in the air, and genetics seem to be involved.

I suffer from periodic bouts of depression, and during these depressive episodes a dark room is pretty much all I can cope with. It also fits well with predictive processing and the dark room problem. Predictive processing has already been applied to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and other delusions (in the form of false error signals), and similarly I think we could say that in some cases the dark room problem simply isn't a problem."}, {"url": "http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/08/09/too-much-night-light-causes-depression.aspx", "passage_text": "1 Exposure to light at night (even dim light) can suppress your body\u2019s melatonin production, and there are many studies that suggest melatonin levels (and by proxy light exposures) control mood-related symptoms, such as those associated with depression.
