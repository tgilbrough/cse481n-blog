I sufferered from a dislocated elbow few weeks ago when a long 40 ft, 2 tonne pipe hit my arm. A surgery was required to reduce the elbow and repair the ligaments, I am wondering how long healing takes. Thank you all in advance"}, {"url": "http://www.antibodywear.com/shoulder-dislocations-symptoms-treatment/", "passage_text": "After the shoulder dislocation has been corrected, it may require immobilization with a cast or sling for 2 to 8 weeks. Complete healing of injured ligaments requires a minimum of 6 weeks. If customary treatment does not prevent a recurrence, athletic activities should be modified until surgery can be done. The appropriate health care for a shoulder dislocation is a doctor\u2019s care. This will include: (1) Manipulation of the joint to reposition the bones. (2) Surgery (sometimes) to restore the joint to its normal position."}, {"url": "http://arcticeasewrap.com/shoulder-dislocation-recovery-time/", "passage_text": "It causes the ligaments that hold your shoulder in place to stretch. A common risk in many sports, a dislocated shoulder can leave you on the sidelines for three months. Following a shoulder dislocation, expect that your arm may be immobilized for about four weeks to allow the joint time to heal properly. A sling or a shoulder immobilizer will prevent you from using your shoulder. In general, dislocated shoulders fully heal within four to 12 weeks depending on your age, the amount and severity of structural damage that was done to the muscles and ligaments at the time of dislocation, and your physical therapy regimen.
