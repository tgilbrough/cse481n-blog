Along with fellow dwarf planets Pluto and Haumea, Makemake is located in the Kuiper Belt, a region outside the orbit of Neptune. Pluto and Makemake are the two brightest objects that have so far been discovered in the Kuiper Belt. It takes 310 Earth years for this dwarf planet to make one orbit around the Sun.

Unlike Pluto and Haumea, Makemake has no moon, which makes it difficult to determine the planet's mass and density.
