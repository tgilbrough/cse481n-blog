You can then multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours for which the employee is being paid. Example: John's salary is $30,000. $30,000/2080 = $14.42 hourly rate. John only worked three business days (24 hours) for this pay period. The amount to enter in the Rate column on the paycheck is $14.42 x 24 = $346.08"}, {"url": "http://payroll.intuit.com/support/kb/1000492.html", "passage_text": "1 Select Employee Center. 2  Double-click on the employee's name. 3  Select the Payroll Info tab. 4  Under the Earnings box in the item name columns, click in a blank area. 5  From the drop-down arrow, select your Salary Item and then enter the employees annual salary.
