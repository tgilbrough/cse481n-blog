Magnesium is in group 2 of the periodic table. A magnesium atom will lose 2 electrons to form a stable 2+ ion. Chlorine is in group 7 of the periodic table. A chlorine atom will gain 1 electron to form a stable 1- ion. In this example the electrons are shown as dots and crosses. Two chlorine atoms will each gain one electron from the magnesium atom. The atoms become ions. The attraction between the oppositely charged ions forms the ionic bond between magnesium and chlorine. The formula for magnesium chloride is MgCl2."}, {"url": "http://dluetgens.com/userfiles//Lab%206.2%20emp%20formula%20magnesium%20chloride.doc", "passage_text": "Describe the ions (Include number of protons and electrons).

In aqueous solution, it is highly soluble in most cases, however some chloride salts, such as silver chloride, lead(II) chloride, and mercury(I) chloride are slightly soluble in water. An example is table salt, which is sodium chloride with the chemical formula NaCl. In water, it dissociates into Na + and Cl \u2212 ions.
