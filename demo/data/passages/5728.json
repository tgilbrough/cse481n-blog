The fluid that is filtered into the Bowman's Capsule is called the glomerular filtrate. The renal tubule is the part of the kidney nephron into which the glomerular filtrate passes after it has reached the Bowman's capsule. The first part of the renal tubule is called the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), which is shown on the right-hand side of the diagram above."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus_(kidney)", "passage_text": "The glomerulus is a tuft of small blood vessels called capillaries located within Bowman's capsule within the kidney.

A glomerulus is enclosed in the sac. Fluids from blood in the glomerulus are collected in the Bowman's capsule (i.e., glomerular filtrate) and further processed along the nephron to form urine. This process is known as ultrafiltration."}, {"url": "http://www.innerbody.com/image_card08/card65-new.html", "passage_text": "The renal tubule ... Click to read more below.
