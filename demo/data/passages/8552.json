[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyolefin", "passage_text": "A polyolefin is any of a class of polymers produced from a simple olefin (also called an alkene with the general formula C n H 2n) as a monomer. For example, polyethylene is the polyolefin produced by polymerizing the olefin ethylene. Polypropylene is another common polyolefin which is made from the olefin propylene. Polyolefin properties range from liquidlike to rigid solids, and are primarily determined by their molecular weight and degree of crystallinity. Polyolefin degrees of crystallinity range from 0% (liquidlike) to 60% or higher (rigid plastics)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyolefin", "passage_text": "Polyolefin elastomer POE is used as a main ingredient in the molded flexible foam technology such as in the fabrication of self skinned footwear (for example, Crocs shoes), seat cushions, arm rests, spa pillows, etc. Hydrogenated polyalphaolefin (PAO) is used as a radar coolant.

Polyolefin is the largest class of organic thermoplastic polymers. They are non-polar, odorless, nonporous materials that are often used in consumer goods, structural plastics, food packaging and industrial products. As a result, they are also called commodity thermoplastics.. The name means oil-like, and refers to the oily or waxy texture of this class of plastic resins. This class of polymers is more commonly referred to as polyalkene, although polyolefin is still a common term in organic chemistry and the petrochemical industry."}, {"url": "http://www.cirfs.org/ManmadeFibres/Fibrerange/Polyolefins.aspx", "passage_text": "There are two polyolefin polymers used to make synthetic fibres, polypropylene and polyethylene, with polypropylene being by far the most important. Properties and End-Uses. Both polyolefin fibres have a density less than 1.0 and therefore, at a given decitex, are thicker than other man-made fibres and give more cover. They do not absorb moisture, which is an advantage in many end-uses, but without modification, they cannot be dyed."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olefin_fiber", "passage_text": "Olefin fiber is a synthetic fiber made from a polyolefin, such as polypropylene or polyethylene. It is used in wallpaper, carpeting, ropes, and vehicle interiors. Olefin's advantages are its strength, colourfastness and comfort, its resistance to staining, mildew, abrasion, sunlight and its good bulk and cover.

These Polyolefin wheels, as with Nylon wheels, are especially suited for wet and corrosive applications. They are very resistant to most commonly encountered liquids. These Extra Heavy Polyolefin wheels are comparable to Nylon wheels in load capacity. They are also especially suited for wet and corrosive applications.
