Nothing lives forever, of course, so there are some which are best replaced after a few years. Thyme, for instance, is classified as a perennial, but it's past its best after about 3 years. Lavender is a perennial, but is usually best replaced after 5-7 years. Just google the herb your interested in and type perennial or annual and the info will show up. Then google it and type hardy, that tells you which zones the plant won't die in a normal winter (ie. doesn't get colder than the minimum for your hardiness zone)."}, {"url": "http://www.audioenglish.org/dictionary/herb.htm", "passage_text": "\u2022 HERB (noun).

Annual plants grow for only one season and so must be planted each spring. Perennials live for several years. Their foliage dies back in the fall, but the roots overwinter and resume growth the following spring. Check zone ratings. Parsley is one of the few common herbs that is a biennial. However, unless you want to harvest the seed, you can treat it like an annual and plant new plants each season.
