There are two sources of trans fat, also known as trans fatty acids: 1  Trans fat formed naturally \u2013 this type of trans fat is produced in the gut of some grazing animals. 2  That\u2019s why small quantities of trans fat can be found in animal products like meat, milk, and milk products."}, {"url": "http://www.tfx.org.uk/page13.html", "passage_text": "They are also commonly found in restaurant food, especially-but not only-in fast food. You can also make your own trans fat (in small amounts) by repeatedly re-heating cooking oil. Some trans fats occur naturally in ruminants' stomachs and are thus found in meat and dairy produce. However the quantities are small, and in any event these natural trans fats do not appear to be harmful to human health-as are the man-made trans fats found in hydrogenated vegetable oils. Many confectionery products contain trans fats. Hydrogenated vegetable oils are found, for example, in many 'bars', including Mars, Twix, Milky Way, Tracker, Snickers, Picnic, Double Decker, Time Out and Fuse."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat", "passage_text": "Trans fats, or trans-unsaturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids, are a type of unsaturated fats that are uncommon in nature but became commonly produced industrially from vegetable fats for use in margarine, snack food, packaged baked goods and frying fast food starting in the 1950s. Two Canadian studies have shown that the natural trans fat vaccenic acid, found in beef and dairy products, could actually be beneficial compared to hydrogenated vegetable shortening, or a mixture of pork lard and soy fat, by lowering total and LDL and triglyceride levels."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/diet/guide/understanding-trans-fats", "passage_text": "The proposed ban doesn't affect the small amounts of natural trans fats found in beef, lamb, and full-fat dairy products. Food makers once used artificial trans fats to enhance the flavor, texture, and shelf life of processed foods. They're bad for your heart health. Trans fats raise LDL bad cholesterol and make you more likely to get heart disease. They also lower HDL good cholesterol.

Most of the trans fat in the foods we eat is formed through a manufacturing process that adds hydrogen to vegetable oil, which converts the liquid into a solid fat at room temperature. This process is called hydrogenation. Partially hydrogenated oils are the major source of artificial trans fats in the food supply."}, {"url": "http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/2145.aspx?CategoryID=51", "passage_text": "Artificial trans fats can be found in some processed foods such as biscuits and cakes, where they are sometimes used to help give products a longer shelf life. However, in recent years many food manufacturers have removed trans fats from their products. If you want to reduce your intake of trans fats, you should: 1  avoid products that list partially hydrogenated fat or oil on the label. 2  include lots of fruit and vegetables in your diet. 3  use fat-free or low-fat dairy products. 4  try to eat fewer biscuits, cakes and pastries."}]
