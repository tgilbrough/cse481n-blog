Any expense that is paid in advance of actually receiving the benefit of the payment is considered a prepaid expense for accounting purposes. Prepaid expenses are recorded on a company\u2019s balance sheet as a current asset, and then recognized as an expense when it is incurred.

First, we'll look at accounting entries that were created when a 'Prepaid' Expense Type was correctly selected along with the 'PCard Lodging' Payment Type. The first line debits the prepaid account (140300). The second line is a system-generated line which credits the prepaid account (140300). This will cause a credit balance to remain in the prepaid account (140300) and will require correcting entries to be entered into the system. It is very important to note that any expense line with a payment type of 'PCard Airfare', 'PCard Lodging' or 'PCard Other' will not produce a reimbursement to the employee."}, {"url": "http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prepaidexpense.asp", "passage_text": "An example of expensing prepaid expenses would be if a company had a one-year insurance policy cost of $1200.

For example, insurance is a prepaid expense, because the purpose of purchasing insurance is to buy proactive protection in case something unfortunate happens.
