Roasting is a great cooking method for a large, tender cut of beef  such as a rib or sirloin roast.

Many people prefer beef cooked rare (especially steak), but this decision is up to the consumer and is certainly not recommended by the USDA. Whole beef cuts usually have bacteria only on the surface, but it is possible for harmful bacteria to be present in the internal portions, so cooking the meat to an internal temperature of 145\u00b0F is sufficient to kill the bacteria."}]
