It is a neurotoxic psychoactive drug and one of the oldest recreational drugs used by humans. Ethanol is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a slight chemical odor. It is used as an antiseptic, a solvent, a fuel, and, due to its low freezing point, the active fluid in post-mercury thermometers."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/info_8169825_difference-between-ethanol-alcohol.html", "passage_text": "Ethanol. Ethanol is an example of a primary alcohol. It is colorless and clear with a pleasant smell. Most alcoholic beverages are made from ethanol as the impurities in the fermentation process give specific liquors -- such as whiskey, brandy or scotch -- their distinct flavors.

It is used primarily as a supplement to gasoline. Pure ethanol is not sold as a stand-alone fuel, at least not yet\u2014it is commonly mixed with gasoline in varying percentages creating a transitional fuel that will pave the way for pure alcohol vehicles.

E85 is a fuel that averages 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline. Most of the motor gasoline with more than 10% ethanol is sold in the Midwest. All gasoline vehicles can use E10.

Ethanol is made from grains or other plants. Blends with lower concentrations of ethanol, such as E10 (10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline), are sometimes used to increase octane and improve emissions quality, but are not considered alternative fuels. Ethanol is good for the economy. Ethanol production supports farmers and creates domestic jobs."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fuel", "passage_text": "Ethanol fuel is ethanol (ethyl alcohol), the same type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages. It is most often used as a motor fuel, mainly as a biofuel additive for gasoline. It is commonly made from biomass such as corn or sugarcane. World ethanol production for transport fuel tripled between 2000 and 2007 from 17 billion to more than 52 billion liters. From 2007 to 2008, the share of ethanol in global gasoline type fuel use increased from 3.7% to 5.4%."}, {"url": "http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ethanol.shtml", "passage_text": "Ethanol. Ethanol is a renewable, domestically produced alcohol fuel made from plant material, such as corn, sugar cane, or grasses. Using ethanol can reduce oil dependence and greenhouse gas emissions. Ethanol fuel use in the U.S. has increased dramatically from about 1.7 billion gallons in 2001 to about 13.2 billion in 2013. 1. "}]
