A Bartholin's cyst, also called a Bartholin's duct cyst, is a small growth just inside the opening of a woman's vagina. Cysts are small fluid-filled sacs that are usually harmless. A Bartholin's cyst can stay small and painless and may not cause any symptoms. However, the cyst can become infected, which can cause a painful collection of pus (an abscess) in the Bartholin's gland.

But a large cyst or an infected cyst (abscess) can cause symptoms. Symptoms of a cyst that is not infected include: 1  A painless lump in the vulva area. 2  Redness or swelling in the vulva area. If a Bartholin duct gets blocked, fluid builds up in the gland. The blocked gland is called a Bartholin gland cyst. (Sometimes it's called a Bartholin duct cyst.) These cysts can range in size from a pea to a large marble. They usually grow slowly. If the Bartholin gland or duct gets infected, it's called a Bartholin gland abscess. Bartholin gland cysts are often small and painless. Some go away without treatment. But if you have symptoms, you might want treatment. If the cyst is infected, you will need treatment"}, {"url": "http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bartholin-cyst/basics/causes/CON-20026333", "passage_text": "Experts believe that the cause of a Bartholin's cyst is a backup of fluid. Fluid may accumulate when the opening of the gland (duct) becomes obstructed, perhaps caused by infection or injury. A Bartholin's cyst can become infected, forming an abscess.

A Bartholin's cyst is not an infection, although it can be caused by an infection, inflammation, or physical blockage (mucus or other impediment) to the Bartholin's ducts (tubes which lead from the glands to the vulva).

A Bartholin's cyst develops when the duct exiting the Bartholin's gland becomes blocked. The fluid produced by the gland then accumulates, causing the gland to swell and form a cyst.

A cyst will usually form when the gland is blocked. If the cyst becomes infected, it can lead to a Bartholin\u2019s abscess. The abscess can be more than an inch in diameter and cause extreme pain. While most people with a Bartholin\u2019s abscess completely recover, there is a chance that the condition will come back. There are two Bartholin\u2019s glands, each about the size of a pea, with one on each side of the vaginal opening. They provide lubrication to the vaginal membranes. Bacteria that get into the gland can cause an infection, swelling, and an obstruction. Fluid builds up in the gland, increasing pressure on the area."}]
