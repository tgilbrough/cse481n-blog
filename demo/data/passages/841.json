DNA also includes sugars and phosphate groups that make the phosphate-deoxyribose backbone. If you think of the structure of DNA as a twisted ladder, the rungs of the ladder are made from the nitrogenous bases. These bases pair up to make each step of the ladder. They also only pair up in a specific way.

The base pairs in DNA are adenine with thymine and cytosine with guanine. DNA has a spiral staircase-like structure.
