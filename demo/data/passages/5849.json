The salivary glands produce saliva to moisten the mouth, to help protect teeth from decay and to digest food. The three major salivary glands are the parotid gland, submandibular gland (also called the submaxillary gland), and sublingual glands. Saliva drains into the mouth through small tubes called ducts. 1  The parotid gland makes 25% of the saliva and drains into the mouth near the upper teeth. 1 The parotid gland makes 25% of the saliva and drains into the mouth near the upper teeth. 2  The submandibular gland makes 70% of the salvia and drains into the mouth from under the tongue. 3  The sublingual gland makes 5% of the saliva and drains into the floor of the mouth."}, {"url": "http://www.entnet.org/content/salivary-glands", "passage_text": "We call the major salivary glands the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. They all secrete saliva into your mouth, the parotid through tubes that drain saliva, called salivary ducts, near your upper teeth, submandibular under your tongue, and the sublingual through many ducts in the floor of your mouth. Obstruction: Obstruction to the flow of saliva most commonly occurs in the parotid and submandibular glands, usually because stones have formed. Symptoms typically occur when eating."}, {"url": "http://www.cancer.org/cancer/salivaryglandcancer/detailedguide/salivary-gland-cancer-what-is-salivary-gland-cancer", "passage_text": "Salivary gland cancer starts in one of the salivary glands. It\u2019s not just a single disease. There are actually several different salivary glands found inside and near your mouth. Many types of cancer and benign (non-cancerous) tumors can develop in these glands. The 2 main types of salivary glands are the major salivary glands and minor salivary glands. There are 3 sets of major salivary glands on each side of the face: 1  The parotid glands, the largest salivary glands, are just in front of the ears. 2  About 7 out of 10 salivary gland tumors start here"}, {"url": "http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/salivary-gland-cancer/basics/definition/CON-20029305", "passage_text": "You have three pairs of major salivary glands under and behind your jaw \u2014 parotid, sublingual and submandibular.
