RNA acts as the information bridge between DNA and protein. mRNA is the message that carries genetic information from the DNA in the nucleus to the cytoplasm. tRNA is the adaptor that reads the mRNA and brings the amino acids to the ribosomes for protein synthesis. RNA polymerase is an enzyme that makes RNA using a DNA template. Like DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase adds nucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction.

RNA polymerase enzyme attaches to the promoter to start mRNA synthesis. 2. Elongation: Individual complementary mRNA nucleotides bond together to form a single mRNA strand. 3.

During transcription, the enzyme RNA polymerase synthesizes a strand of messenger RNA (mRNA) using one strand of the gene as a template. mRNA is synthesized using nucleotides that contain the bases A, C, G, and U (instead of T), which pair with the complementary bases of the DNA template strand. The starting point for transcription, where RNA polymerase unwinds the DNA and begins to make a complementary mRNA copy, is the promoter site; the region of DNA that is the endpoint of transcription is the terminator site; mRNA is synthesized in the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction."}, {"url": "http://classes.midlandstech.edu/carterp/Courses/bio225/chap08/lecture3.htm", "passage_text": "First of all, since RNA polymerase synthesizes mRNA from 5' to 3' (just like DNA polymerase) the DNA template strand has to be read from 3' to 5' (just like when DNA polymerase uses a DNA template strand to synthesize a new complementary DNA strand).
