It is caused by holes or breaks in the retina called retinal tears. A retinal tear allows fluid from the middle of the eye to pass through the tear and settle under the retina. The detachment does not involve tears in the retina or traction from the vitreous. Exudative retinal detachment is most often a complication of other diseases or conditions. These can include severe macular degeneration, eye tumors, inflammation in the choroid or the retina, or severe high blood pressure."}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/retinal-detachment", "passage_text": "The retina works with the cornea, lens, and other parts of the eye and the brain to produce normal vision. Retinal detachment occurs when the retina separates from the back of the eye. This causes loss of vision that can be partial or total, depending on how much of the retina is detached. Retinal detachment is a medical emergency. "}, {"url": "http://webeye.ophth.uiowa.edu/eyeforum/tutorials/retinal-detachment-med-students/", "passage_text": "Tractional.

Initial detachment may be localized or broad, but without rapid treatment the entire retina may detach, leading to vision loss and blindness. It is almost always classified as a medical emergency. Permanent damage may occur if the detachment is not repaired within 24\u201372 hours."}, {"url": "http://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/0401/p1691.html", "passage_text": "Retinal detachment often is a preventable cause of vision loss. There are three types of retinal detachments: exudative, tractional, and rhegmatogenous. The most common type is rhegmatogenous, which results from retinal breaks caused by vitreoretinal traction. Risk factors for retinal detachment include advancing age, previous cataract surgery, myopia, and trauma. The second type of detachment, tractional retinal detachment, occurs via centripetal mechanical forces on the retina, usually mediated by fibrotic tissue resulting from previous hemorrhage, injury, surgery, infection, or inflammation."}, {"url": "https://nei.nih.gov/health/retinaldetach/retinaldetach", "passage_text": "The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue that lines the inside of the eye and sends visual messages through the optic nerve to the brain.
