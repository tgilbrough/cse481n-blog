Insurance coverage is usually minimal, and patients often are surprised by high out-of-pocket costs. An implant to replace a single tooth can cost $3,000 to $4,500, depending on where you live.

If you need to replace most or all of your teeth, dentures are clearly the cheaper alternative, costing around $2,500 for a set (upper and lower jaws).
