If this solution were to be suddenly cooled at a rate faster than the rate of precipitation, the solution will become supersaturated until the solute precipitates to the temperature-determined saturation point. Special conditions need to be met in order to generate a supersaturated solution. One of the easiest ways to do this relies on the temperature dependence of solubility.

One treatment that appears to be very promising is supersaturated oxygen-a therapy based on the known benefits of hyperbaric oxygen treatment in patients with burns and wounds. A heart attack is caused by a sudden blockage in one of the coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle with oxygen. This interruption in blood flow causes the muscle cells to die which may weaken the pumping ability of the heart, resulting in congestive heart failure or death."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation", "passage_text": "Oxygen saturation (symbol SO2) is a relative measure of the amount of oxygen that is dissolved or carried in a given medium. It can be measured with a dissolved oxygen probe such as an oxygen sensor or an optode in liquid media, usually water. The standard unit of oxygen saturation is percent (%). In medicine, oxygen saturation refers to oxygenation, or when oxygen molecules (O 2) enter the tissues of the body. In this case blood is oxygenated in the lungs, where oxygen molecules travel from the air and into the blood."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersaturation", "passage_text": "Supersaturation is a state of a solution that contains more of the dissolved material than could be dissolved by the solvent under normal circumstances.
