Regular babysitting hours are typically considered between 8:00am and 10:00pm. If you require a babysitter to babysit outside of these usual hours, additional compensation should be considered. If paying hourly, an extra $2 per hour worked past 10:00pm or before 8:00am is reasonable. How much experience a babysitter has is one of the most important factors in determining a reasonable babysitting charge. A high school student with little or no experience would normally earn much less than an experienced adult."}, {"url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/babysitting-costs-hourly-rate-infographic-urbansitter_n_1577285.html", "passage_text": "Some New York babysitters caring for three children at a time might even make more than $20 per hour.

Ask their hourly or daily rate for the age groups that you'll be babysitting. If you get a daycare license, you can charge dollar for dollar. If unlicensed, you will need to charge a dollar less per hour. I strongly suggest a business license when babysitting, even if a teenager.
