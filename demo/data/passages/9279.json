Large reserves of coal are therefore taken from the coal mines to the industries which are acres away from the mines. The petroleum is also taken to too far off power stations to produce energy. Fossil fuels are the highest producers of calorific value in terms of energy. This is also one of the reasons why they are still preferred over the renewable sources of energy or the alternative sources of energy. 4. Stability: The fossil fuels are composed of the molecules of carbon, and hydrogen."}, {"url": "http://www.iptv.org/exploremore/energy/profiles/fossil_fuels.cfm", "passage_text": "Fossil fuels are energy resources that come from the remains of plants and animals. These remains are millions of years old. There are three fossil fuels: petroleum oil, natural gas, and coal. Fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and natural gas, provide the energy that powers our lifestyles and our economy. Fossil fuels power everything from the planes in the sky to the cars on the road."}, {"url": "http://www.darvill.clara.net/altenerg/fossil.htm", "passage_text": "Basically, the main drawback of fossil fuels is pollution. Burning any fossil fuel produces carbon dioxide, which contributes to the greenhouse effect, warming the Earth. Burning coal produces more carbon dioxide than burning oil or gas.

Easily Available: Since these fossil fuels have been of such a great source of energy, more and more extractions are going on every day. The geologists all around the world are trying to find out mines of coals. The pressure is even more as the population is increasing day by day.

There are many advantages of biofuels over fossil fuels that make the alternative fuel source an attractive option now and in the future. Biofuels have been in production for the last few decades and have really begun to take off with the awareness of global warming going around the world. 1 Biofuels do not release as much carbon as fossil fuels do, and because of this, there are fewer harmful emissions out of biofuels. 2  Renewable. 3  Being made from organic materials, and even organic waste, there is practically an infinite amount of biofuels available."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "passage_text": "Fossil fuels are fuels formed by natural processes such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms. The age of the organisms and their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years, and sometimes exceeds 650 million years. Fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include coal, petroleum and natural gas. Other more commonly used derivatives of fossil fuels include kerosene and propane"}, {"url": "http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/Disadvantages_FossilFuels.php", "passage_text": "Disadvantages of Fossil Fuels. 1. Environmental Hazards: Environmental pollution is one of the major disadvantage of fossil fuels.
