Mangrove swamps are found in tropical and subtropical tidal areas. Areas where mangal occurs include estuaries and marine shorelines. The intertidal existence to which these trees are adapted represents the major limitation to the number of species able to thrive in their habitat."}, {"url": "http://mangrove.org/video/Mangrove.pdf", "passage_text": "Ecological Importance of mangrove Habitat Coastal Reforestation Technology Green Funeral Services mangrove.org 6001 Highway A1A Indian River Shores, FL 32963 Tel: 321-431-6595 E-mail: riley@mangrove.org Mangrove trees are an indigenous species to Florida and a major contributor to the state's marine environment.

Mangrove forests are an ecosystem of incredible biological diversity comprising hundreds of algae, mollusk, crustacean, fish, insect, reptile, bird, and mammal species.

Mangrove forests play a central role in transferring organic matter and energy from the land to marine ecosystems. This matter and energy comes from detritus from fallen leaves and branches, and forms the base of important marine food chains. These same bacteria give mangroves their rotten egg smell-as the sediment is oxygen-poor, only bacteria that use sulphur for energy can survive. The dense root systems form a home for fish, crabs, shrimps, and molluscs. They also serve as nurseries for juvenile fish."}, {"url": "http://dep.state.fl.us/water/wetlands/mangroves/mangrove_facts.htm", "passage_text": "Mangroves are tropical plants that are adapted to loose, wet soils, salt water, and being periodically submerged by tides.
