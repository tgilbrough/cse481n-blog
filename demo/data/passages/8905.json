Amylose has a linear chain structure made up of hundreds of glucose molecules that is linked by a alpha 1,4 glycosidic linkage. Due to the nature of these alpha 1,4 bonds, the macromolecule often assumes a bent shape. Many organisms store energy in the form of polysaccharides, commonly homopolymers of glucose. Glycogen, the sugar used by animals to store energy, is composed of alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds with branched alpha-1,6 bonds present at about every tenth monomer."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/The_main_structural_difference_between_starch_glycogen_cellulose_comes_from", "passage_text": "In amylopectin there are two types of glycosidic bonds: 1,4 and 1,6.

This produces a branch point in the amylopectin molecule.

Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by \u03b1(1\u21926) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain.
