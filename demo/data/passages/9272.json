When pollination occurs and the pollen grain makes contact with the stigma (the apex of the pistil), the tube cell elongates its cytoplasm, forming the pollen tube that grows towards the ovary. The generative cell divides to form two sperm nuclei (male gametes), which then migrate through the pollen tube. 13. A typical seed is composed of the embryo, endosperm and shell. Within seeds of angiosperms, there are one or two cotyledons (seed leaves, one in monocots, two in dicots). The endosperm is the tissue within the seed that has the function of nourishing the embryo."}, {"url": "https://quizlet.com/5278897/ap-biology-chapter-30-flash-cards/", "passage_text": "1. sporophyte 2. microspores 3. microsporangia 4. pollen cone 5. pollen nuclei A) 1, 4, 3, 2, 5 B) 1, 4, 2, 3, 5 C) 1, 2, 3, 5, 4 D) 4, 1, 2, 3, 5 E) 4, 3, 2, 5, 1. 1. cells of sporangium 2. cells in the interior of a subterranean root 3. epidermal cells of sporophyte megaphylls 4. cells of a gametophyte A) 3, 4, 1, 2 B) 3, 4, 2, 1 C) 3, 1, 4, 2 D) 3, 2, 1, 4 E) 3, 1, 2, 4."}, {"url": "http://wps.aw.com/bc_campbell_essentials_4_oa/144/36967/9463671.cw/content/index.html", "passage_text": "In pines, the female gametophyte contains _____, each of which contains a(n) _____.

A gametophyte is the haploid multicellular stage in the alternation of generations life cycle of plants and algae. It develops from a spore by mitotic cell division. Spores are the products of meiosis in sporophytes. Gametophytes produce haploid gametes by mitosis. In some types of plants and algae (e.g. Ulva) gametes are isogamous --that is, the gametes are all of one size, shape and general morphology. In land plants, Anisogamy is universal.

Best Answer: pine tree represents the diploid sporophyte generation. By meiosis, the pine eventually produces male and female gametophytes. The male gametophytes of the pine are smallthey are the pollen grains released by male cones to be dispersed to female cones. The larger female gametophytes remain within the ovules of the female cones of the pine and are dependent on the surrounding sporophyte tissues for their nutrition. Source(s):"}]
