The pericardium is the outer layer of the heart or a sack in which the heart is stored. It basically protects the heart and it's vessels. The purpose of it is to protect and lubricate the heart. the peircardium is the outermost coverin of your heart.. protects against friction rubs and protects againsts shocks(traumatic) as it contains 40-50 ml of pericardial fluid.."}, {"url": "http://beltina.org/health-dictionary/pericardium-function-definition.html", "passage_text": "What is Pericardium, definition and function. Pericardium is a tough, two-layer membranous sac that encloses the HEART. The pericardium\u2019s fibrous outer layer, called the fibrous pericardium, protects the heart from contact with the chest wall and other structures in the chest, including the LUNGS and the sternum. The inner layer of the pericardium is a filmy envelope. Its two surfaces are the parietal pericardium, which contacts the fibrous pericardium, and the epicardium, which covers the MYOCARDIUM somewhat like a wet tissue."}, {"url": "http://biology.about.com/od/anatomy/a/aa050407a.htm", "passage_text": "Pericardial Membranes. 1  Fibrous Pericardium-the outer fibrous sac that covers the heart. 2  Parietal Pericardium-lies between the visceral pericardium and the fibrous pericardium. 3  Visceral Pericardium-also called the epicardium, this is the outer layer of the wall of the heart. The pericardium has several functions: The pericardium is divided into three layers: The pericardial cavity lies between the visceral pericardium and the parietal pericardium.

The space between the two layers of serous pericardium (see below), the pericardial cavity, is filled with serous fluid which protects the heart from any kind of external jerk or shock.
