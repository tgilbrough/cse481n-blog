According to location, some kinds of motor neurons are the peripheral motor neurons and the upper motor neurons. Also called motoneuron. Compare sensory nerve. The dendrites receive stimuli from other nerves or from a receptor organ, such as the skin or ear, and transmit them through the neuron to the axon. The axon conducts the impulses to the dendrite of another neuron or to an effector organ that is thereby stimulated to action."}, {"url": "http://courses.washington.edu/conj/motor/motorunit.htm", "passage_text": "Definition of Motor Unit. A motor unit consists of one somatic efferent (motor) neuron and all of the muscle fibers (cells) that it innervates. In the figure to the right, two motor units are illustrated diagrammatically.
