Most of the North American species are in the genus Tibicen: the annual or dog-day cicadas (so named because they emerge in late July and August [1]). Which come out every year. The best-known North American genus is Magicicada, however. These periodical cicadas have an extremely long life cycle of 13 to 17 years and emerge in large numbers. xyzzy \u00b7 5 years ago. Best Answer: They came out every 17 years or so. But you have some that come out alternately. Like how people give birth every year insects come out in intervals to one another at the same time. but you also have a lot of different species of Cicadas that you see as well that are out every year"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/17-year-cicadas-will-overrun-the-east-coast-any-day-now-2013-5", "passage_text": "There are also species of periodical cicadas, as they're called, that emerge from the ground every 13 years, but we won't see those in 2013 (p eriodical cicadas are different from annual cicadas which come out every year). There are 12 different broods of the 17-year cicada and three different broods of the 13-year cicada.

Some species have much longer life cycles, such as the North American genus, Magicicada, which has a number of distinct  broods  that go through either a 17-year or, in some parts of the world, a 13-year life cycle. Most cicadas are cryptic, singing at night to avoid predators.
