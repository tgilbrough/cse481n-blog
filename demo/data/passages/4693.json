The hypothalamus, located in the brain, produces thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) that tells the pituitary gland to make thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Your TSH level can indicate if your thyroid gland is working properly. While a TSH test is usually used as the initial blood test to detect hypothyroidism, the doctor may need to order additional tests to diagnose hypothyroidism."}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/tsh", "passage_text": "It is sometimes called a \u201cthyrotropin test.\u201d.

Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is one of the most important hormones currently used to diagnose thyroid abnormalities. This glycoprotein is secreted by the pituitary and stimulates release of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) from the thyroid gland. Question 1."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone", "passage_text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (also known as thyrotropin, TSH, or hTSH for human TSH) is a pituitary hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroxine (T 4), and then triiodothyronine (T 3) which stimulates the metabolism of almost every tissue in the body. TSH (with a half life of about an hour) stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete the hormone thyroxine (T 4), which has only a slight effect on metabolism. T 4 is converted to triiodothyronine (T 3), which is the active hormone that stimulates"}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/women/thyroid-stimulating-hormone-tsh?page=2", "passage_text": "Results.

Guide. A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) blood test is used to check for thyroid gland problems. TSH is produced when the hypothalamus releases a substance called thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH then triggers the pituitary gland to release TSH.
