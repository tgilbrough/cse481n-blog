In the spring and fall I use around 500 Kwh/mo. In the summer it goes up to around 800 Kwh/mo. Last winter we had a few cold snaps. my usage went up to 750 Kwh for a couple of months. Its very mild today and I have the windows open and a nice cool breeze through here; not running the HVAC at all.... I negotiated what I think is a good rate. I pay .09\u00a2 per Kwh. The average Texas home pays around .12 to .22\u00a2. By contrast, the average price in Kentucky is .609\u00a2. -it must be nice"}, {"url": "http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&t=3", "passage_text": "How much electricity does an American home use?

Not 750 sq. ft., but just to give you an idea. I am in an 850 sw. ft. apartment, roughly 5 years old, windows facing North, keep my ac on 82 while at work, 80 when home, and 77 at night. On my first bill, on a 22 day billing cycle it was 304KWh. Roughly 14 KWh/day, so at 30 days, that would be 420 Kwh. 1500 KWh in a 750 sq. ft. apartment, in as mild a month as this April is BAD. Something is really wrong, unless you have bad insulation, old apartment, leaky areas, and keep the AC on 65 all day.
