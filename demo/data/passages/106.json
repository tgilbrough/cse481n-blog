Food cost refers to the menu price of a certain dish in comparison to the cost of the food used to prepare that same dish. In other words, how much you pay for food will determine how much you need to charge for it. Generally, food cost should be around 30-35%. This means that if you pay $1.00 for something, you need to charge minimum of $3.34. It may seem like you are charging a lot more than necessary, but keep in mind that you aren't just paying for the food itself."}, {"url": "http://smallbusiness.chron.com/common-food-labor-cost-percentages-14700.html", "passage_text": "How Food and Labor Costs are Calculated.

If, at the same restaurant, labor (including payroll taxes and benefits) equal $5,000 for the week, then the labor cost is 25 percent."}, {"url": "http://smallbusiness.chron.com/common-food-labor-cost-percentages-14700.html", "passage_text": "Look at Prime Costs to Determine Success.
