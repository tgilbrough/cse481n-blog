Originally, an acre was understood as a selion of land sized at forty perches (660 ft, or 1 furlong) long and four perches (66 ft) wide; this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plough in one day."}, {"url": "http://sizes.com/units/acre_FAQ.htm", "passage_text": "It is purely an area of 43,560 square feet.
