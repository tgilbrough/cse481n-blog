It is used to help diagnose the cause of a low or high calcium level and to help distinguish between parathyroid-related and non-parathyroid-related causes. 1 If calcium levels are high and PTH levels are high, then the parathyroid glands are producing inappropriately high amounts of PTH. 2  A health practitioner may order X-rays or other imaging studies to help determine the cause and evaluate the severity of hyperparathyroidism."}, {"url": "http://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/parathyroid_hormone.aspx", "passage_text": "Parathyroid hormone is secreted by the parathyroid glands and is the most important regulator of calcium levels in the blood and within the bones.

When the calcium level rises and is back to normal, the release of parathyroid hormone from the parathyroids is suppressed. However, parathyroid hormone and calcitonin work together to control calcium levels in the blood.

This hormone is secreted from cells of the parathyroid glands and finds its major target cells in bone and kidney. Another hormone, parathyroid hormone-related protein, binds to the same receptor as parathyroid hormone and has major effects on development."}, {"url": "http://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/parathyroid_hormone.aspx", "passage_text": "What is parathyroid hormone? Parathyroid hormone is secreted from the four parathyroid glands, which are small glands in the neck, located behind the thyroid gland. Parathyroid hormone regulates calcium levels in the blood, largely by increasing the levels when they are too low. It does this through its actions on the kidneys, bones and intestine: 1 Bones-Parathyroid hormone stimulates the release of calcium from large calcium stores in the bones into the bloodstream. 2  This increases bone destruction and decreases the formation of new bone."}, {"url": "http://www.cigna.com/healthwellness/hw/medical-tests/parathyroid-hormone-hw8101", "passage_text": "A parathyroid hormone (PTH) blood test measures the level of parathyroid hormone in the blood.

PTH is made by four tiny parathyroid glands in your neck. PTH circulates in your blood and is needed to regulate the level of calcium in your blood. Your heart, bones, nervous system, and kidneys need a normal calcium level in the blood to work the way they should. If your calcium level is too low, your parathyroid glands release PTH to get more calcium into your blood. If your calcium level is too high, your parathyroid glands stop producing PTH.
