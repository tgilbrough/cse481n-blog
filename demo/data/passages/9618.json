Supplement. Organisms such as animals, plants, fungi, and protists are examples of eukaryotes because their cells are organized into compartmentalized structures called organelles, the nucleus in particular. The presence of a distinct nucleus encased within membranes differentiates the eukaryotes from the prokaryotes."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080220082315AA3bcwa", "passage_text": "For example, the DNA in the two cell types is precisely the same kind of DNA, and the genetic code for a prokaryotic cell is exactly the same genetic code used in eukaryotic cells. Some things which seem to be differences aren't. For example, the prokaryotic cell has a cell wall, and this animal cell does not. However, many kinds of eukaryotic cells do have cell walls. Despite all of these similarities, the differences are also clear. "}, {"url": "http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/HBASE/Biology/prokar.html", "passage_text": "Prokaryotic Cells.

Eukaryotic-protist, amoeba, etc. An example of a prokaryote would be bacteria or any single cellular organism and an example of a eukaryote would be any multicellular organism. An example of a prokaryotic organism is bacteria and an example of a eukaryotic organism is a plant cell."}]
