Costa Rica is a central American nation, located between Nicaragua and Panama. Its borders span 309 kilometers (192 miles) with Nicaragua and 330 kilometers (205 miles) with Panama. Costa Rica also borders the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, its coastline reaching across 1,290 kilometers (802 miles). The country has 51,100 square kilometers (19,730 square miles) of land, which is slightly less than the size of West Virginia, including the Isla del Coco (a small island in the Pacific Ocean)."}, {"url": "http://www.anywherecostarica.com/questions/geography-weather/how-big-is-costa-rica", "passage_text": "Costa Rica is relatively small - 19,700 square miles (51,100 sq. km), ranking it 129th in worldwide landmass. Costa Rica's size is commonly compared to the state of West Virgina (24,231 sq. mi., 62,758 sq. km) and the European state of Denmark (16,629 sq. mi., 43,069 sq. km). Don't let Costa Rica's small size fool you; it is a vast country of rolling mountains, open plains and lush river valleys. These natural features prevent the construction of super highways that would, in theory, connect relatively close locations."}]
