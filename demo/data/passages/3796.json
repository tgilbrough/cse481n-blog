In size and mass, it is similar to Earth, and is often described as Earth's sister or twin.

Venus takes 225 Earth days to complete one orbit of the Sun. And like the other planets in our solar system, Venus rotates about its axis. However, Venus is the only planet that rotates from east to west instead of west to east. This means, that if we lived on Venus, the Sun would appear to rise in the west in the morning, and set in the east in the evening! Even stranger, Venus rotates so slowly that one day on Venus is equivalent to 117 days on Earth. As a result, the gravity on Venus (8.87 m/s2) is nearly the same as it is on Earth (9.81 m/s2). Additionally, scientists conclude that the structure of the planet's interior is similar to Earth's, with an iron core and a rocky mantel."}, {"url": "http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/F_The_Planet_Venus_5-8.html", "passage_text": "Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and is Earth's closest neighbor in the solar system.
