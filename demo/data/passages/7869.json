The misattribution of memory is therefore more likely to occur as the time between the encoding of an experience and the recall of the subsequent memory increases.

But there's a wrinkle: Plagiarism isn't always deliberate. Indeed, research has shown that inadvertent plagiarism--or cryptomnesia, as psychologists have termed the phenomenon--is a rather common memory glitch that pervades everyday cognitive functioning. The mechanisms that underlie cryptomnesia also have important implications for creativity, Marsh believes. Recently, he, Landau, Hicks and psychologist Thomas B.
