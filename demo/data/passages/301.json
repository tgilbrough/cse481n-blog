Operating systems derived from the original BSD code remain actively developed and widely used. Historically, BSD has been considered a branch of Unix, Berkeley Unix, because it shared the initial codebase and design with the original AT&T Unix operating system. Most of the current BSD operating systems are open source and available for download, free of charge, under the BSD License, the most notable exception being Mac OS X. They also generally use a monolithic kernel architecture, apart from Mac OS X and DragonFly BSD which feature hybrid kernels."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD", "passage_text": "FreeBSD is a free Unix-like operating system descended from Research Unix via the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD).
