Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacillus that is an opportunistic pathogen [ 1-4 ], particularly among hospitalized patients.

S. maltophilia is the only species of Stenotrophomonas known to infect humans [ 7 ], whereas its closest genetic relatives are plant pathogens [ 7,8 ].

Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia is an aerobic gram-negative bacillus that is found in various aquatic environments. It is an uncommon pathogen in humans.
