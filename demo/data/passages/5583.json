[{"url": "http://howthingsfly.si.edu/ask-an-explainer/why-are-airplanes-pressurized", "passage_text": "Airplanes are pressurized because the air is very thin at the altitude they fly. The average passenger jet has a cruising altitude of about 30,000 to 40,000 feet. At this altitude humans can\u2019t breathe very well and our body gets less oxygen. This is called hypoxia and can cause slower thinking, dimmed vision, and death."}, {"url": "http://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/how-things-work-cabin-pressure-2870604/", "passage_text": "To maintain the pressure in the cabin equal to that at low altitude, even while the airplane is at 30,000 feet, the incoming air is held within the cabin by opening and closing an outflow valve, which releases the incoming air at a rate regulated by pressure sensors."}, {"url": "http://www.cnn.com/2011/TRAVEL/04/04/airplane.cabin.pressure/index.html", "passage_text": "Because of this, aircraft are pressurized to simulate a lower altitude inside the cabin. As an aircraft climbs to a high altitude, the cabin is pressurized, and as it descends for landing, it is gradually de-pressurized."}, {"url": "http://www.altitude.org/air_pressure.php", "passage_text": "At sea level there is a pressure equivalent to 10 metres of water pressing down on all of us all the time. This is because of the weight of the air above us in the atmosphere. When you travel up a mountain, there is less air above you in the atmosphere,"}, {"url": "http://www.who.int/ith/mode_of_travel/cab/en/", "passage_text": "Although aircraft cabins are pressurized, cabin air pressure at cruising altitude is lower than air pressure at sea level. At typical cruising altitudes in the range 11 000\u201312 200 m (36 000\u201340 000 feet), air pressure in the cabin is equivalent to the outside air pressure at 1800\u20132400 m (6000\u20138000 feet) above sea level. As a consequence, less oxygen is taken up by the blood (hypoxia) and gases within the body expand."}]
