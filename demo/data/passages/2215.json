The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the neural tissue from variations in blood composition and toxins. Elsewhere in the body the extracellular concentrations of hormones, amino acids and potassium undergo frequent fluctuations, especially after meals, exercise or stressful times. All areas of the brain do not have a blood-brain barrier. The structures located at strategic positions in the midline of the ventricular system and lack the BBB are collectively referred to as circumventricular organs (CVOs)."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeekhealth.com/what-is-the-blood-brain-barrier.htm", "passage_text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a protective barrier which is designed to keep the environment in the brain as stable as possible.
