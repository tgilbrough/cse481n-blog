The alkali metals, found in group 1 of the periodic table (formerly known as group IA), are very reactive metals that do not occur freely in nature. These metals have only one electron in their outer shell. Therefore, they are ready to lose that one electron in ionic bonding with other elements.

Alkali metals form cations readily by losing the valence electrons (due to the low ionization energies and large atomic sizes).

Bases are substances that react with acids and neutralise them. They are usually metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal carbonates or metal hydrogen carbonates. Many bases are insoluble-they do not dissolve in water. If a base does dissolve in water, we call it an alkali. Here are two examples: Copper oxide is a base because it will react with acids and neutralise them, but it is not an alkali because it does not dissolve in water. Sodium hydroxide is a base because it will react with acids and neutralise them."}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/standard/chemistry/acids/acids/revision/1/", "passage_text": "Both potassium oxide and calcium oxide are examples of soluble metal oxides which dissolve in water to produce alkaline solutions.
