A surgeon creates an arteriovenous fistula by making a connection between an artery (which carries blood away from the heart) and a vein (which carries blood back to the heart). This artificial connection allows the vein to become larger and for the walls of the vein to thicken, a process termed maturation. An arteriovenous fistula is the preferred type of vascular access due to lower rate of infection and clot formation, resulting in greater longevity than other types of vascular access. However, not everyone is a good candidate for an arteriovenous fistula, particularly older patients and patients with small veins."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_fistula", "passage_text": "An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection or passageway between an artery and a vein.

An arteriovenous (AV) fistula is an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein. Normally, blood flows from your arteries to your capillaries to your veins. Nutrients and oxygen in your blood travel from your capillaries to tissues in your body. With an arteriovenous fistula, blood flows directly from an artery into a vein, bypassing some capillaries. When this happens, tissues below the bypassed capillaries receive a diminished blood supply. Arteriovenous fistulas usually occur in the legs, but can develop anywhere in the body"}, {"url": "http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/arteriovenous+fistula", "passage_text": "An arteriovenous fistula is a disruption of the normal blood flow pattern. Normally, oxygenated blood flows to the tissue through arteries and capillaries. Following the release of oxygen in the tissues, the blood returns to the heart in veins.
