Best Answer: Arteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the body. Veins collect oxygen-depleted blood from the body and bring it back to the heart and lungs. Capillaries are the smallest vessels. Blood flows from small arteries to capillaries to small veins. All exchange of nutrients occurs in-between capillaries & tissues. Veins & artieries just carry blood--nutrients do not enter or leave veins & arteries. Physically, arteries have thick muscular wal"}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061211154354AAZEC9A", "passage_text": "All three are types of blood vessels. Arteries carry freshly-oxygenated blood away from the heart and supply it to organs and other parts of the body that need oxygen. Veins carry oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart. Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that branch off from arteries and veins, and that most closely interact with tissue to supply oxygen to them (or carry oxygen-depleted blood away from them).

Veins, arteries and capillaries are the three types of blood vessels in the circulatory system. The blood vessels carry blood, which contains antibodies, nutrients, oxygen, electrolytes and hormones, throughout the body to be used by the organs. Blood contains oxygen and nutrients the body needs to survive. The arteries, veins and capillaries are types of blood vessels that transport the vital blood throughout the body. Learn the differences between the types of blood vessels."}]
