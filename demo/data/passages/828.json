To find out how many steps you take each day, buy a pedometer similar to the one in the video at the bottom of this page. Clip it firmly to your belt or waistband, and it will measure every step you take: around the house, across the office, window shopping, to school or the park. Walking is classed as a moderate-intensity activity and counts towards your recommended 150 minutes of weekly exercise. If you walk 10,000 steps a day, you will probably do more than 150 minutes and that's great: research suggests that the more activity you do the better, as there are numerous benefits of exercise."}, {"url": "http://www.mynetdiary.com/seriously-you-want-me-to-walk-how-many-steps-per.html", "passage_text": "That would be about 3500 - 4000 steps for someone who can walk at a pace of 3.5 - 4 MPH. If you are truly sedentary now (e.g. you get 2000 or fewer total steps per day, including exercise), then don't aim to walk 10,000 steps tomorrow. Work up to that in 500 step increments over time. Most of us walk briskly at about 3.5 miles per hour which takes about 17 minutes per mile or about 85 minutes for 5 miles. The faster your pace (MPH), the faster you can walk the 5 miles. If you walk at a pace of 4 MPH, then you will take 15 minutes to walk one mile or 11/4 hours to walk 5 miles."}, {"url": "http://www.wikihow.com/Walk-10%2C000-Steps-a-Day", "passage_text": "The rationale behind 10,000 steps a day is very simple\u2013\u2013it's about staying motivated. Numerous studies undertaken by health experts revealed that many participants were more excited about counting 10,000 steps through both walking and general movement than by being asked to perform 30 minute walking stints. And if the goal of 10,000 steps isn't motivator enough for you, here are some other great reasons to add 10,000 steps a day to your routine: 1  Walking is a low impact, effective way to lose weight. 2  Walking helps to reduce blood pressure."}, {"url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/science-of-us/10000-steps-walk-day_b_7604514.html", "passage_text": "(Photo: SuperStock/Getty Images).

If you pluck someone off the street, whether in New York or Wichita or Seattle or Sacramento, and ask them how many steps people should aim for per day in order to get enough physical activity, they'll probably tell you 10,000. In other words: Yeah, 10,000 steps is great, but if you follow up those 10,000 steps by buying a 500-calorie hamburger -- and, more generally, spend the rest of your day eating junk -- you can still gain weight and face all sorts of unpleasant negative health outcomes."}, {"url": "http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/06/how-many-steps-a-day-really-walk.html", "passage_text": "Share.

By following this routine, you'll expend an additional 2,000 to 3,500 calories per week. One pound of fat equals 3,500 calories. The average American takes 2,300 to 3,000 steps per day. While walking for one hour at a rate of 5 mph, or 10,000 steps, is recommended to lose an average of one pound a week, it may be an overwhelming goal. Start slow and assess your exercise tolerance.
