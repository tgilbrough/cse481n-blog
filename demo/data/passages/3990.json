Sarcoidosis is not a cancer and is not a contagious disease in some cases it seems to run in families. Medical textbooks twenty years ago listed the disease as being primarily one of African American women and patients of Scandinavian descent."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/lung/understanding-sarcoidosis-basics", "passage_text": "Among African-Americans, the rate is higher. Sarcoidosis is not cancer; nor is it contagious. Although it can occur in families, it is not inherited. Usually the disease is not disabling; most people with sarcoidosis live normal lives. In fact, in the majority of cases, the disease appears only briefly and disappears on its own. It is characterized by the buildup of immune system cells in organs that form small clusters called granulomas, a type of inflammation of the involved tissues. Sarcoidosis is found throughout the world."}, {"url": "http://www.sarcoid-network.org/FAQ/faq-disease.php", "passage_text": "Multi-system sarcoidosis is not caused by any element, but granulomatous disease of the lung and skin may be caused by beryllium. The disease is called berylliosis. Zirconium (used in deodorants) can cause granulomas in the skin, but it does not cause not systemic sarcoidosis. 35.

If you have sarcoidosis, you may have no symptoms at all. Only small changes might show up on a chest x-ray, or you may have progressive failure of many organs in your body. The cause of sarcoidosis isn't known. Fever is not often associated with sarcoidosis. Although the nervous system isn't usually affected, sar-coidosis can cause muscle weakness or paralysis, seizures, tremor, poor coordination, hearing loss, blindness or problems with walking."}, {"url": "http://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/sarcoidosis/learn-about-sarcoidosis.html", "passage_text": "While no one knows what causes sarcoidosis, it is associated with increased immune system activity. This causes clusters of inflamed tissue (granulomas) to form in your body and lymph nodes (part of the immune system). Sarcoidosis most commonly affects your lungs, but it can affect any organ in your body. People over the age of 20 and women are more likely to develop sarcoidosis. Many patients never have symptoms, and the disease is diagnosed only because a chest X-ray is taken for another reason. In very few cases, sarcoidosis can be life-threatening if it causes heart or severe lung disease. If your symptoms last more than 2 years despite treatment, your disease is considered chronic, and the symptoms may worsen your quality of life."}, {"url": "http://www.equiworld.net/horses/horsecare/veterinary/sarcoids/index.htm", "passage_text": "A Sarcoid is a tumour involving connective tissue {ie. muscle, sub-cutaneos tissue, etc.}.
