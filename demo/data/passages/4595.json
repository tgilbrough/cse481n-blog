So, although this phrase does not provide the EXACT weight of each liquid, it does provide a very simple rule for determining approximately how much liquids weigh. In the case of water, there are eight (8) pints of water in a gallon. Using this rule, a gallon (eight pints) would weigh approximately eight (8) pounds, which is very, very close to a gallon of water's exact weight of 8.35 pounds which is found in the more detailed and scientifically correct answers to this question. Likewise a gallon of ice and a gallon of room temp water have different weights even though they are the same size. One gallon of water, at 20 degrees Celsius, weighs 8.33 pounds.

Q. What is the freeze point of DEF? A. A 32.5% solution of DEF will begin to crystallize and freeze at 12 deg F (-11 deg C). At 32.5%, both the urea and water will freeze at the same rate, ensuring that as it thaws, the fluid does not become diluted, or over concentrated. A. DEF consumption will be approximately 1-2% of the diesel fuel consumed. Another way to consider it is that DEF will be consumed on a 50 to 1 ratio with diesel.

Compared to diesel fuel at approx 7.05 lbs and gasoline at an average of 6.19 lbs, DEF is a relatively heavy product. How much DEF can I haul? With DEF weighing in at around 9lbs per gallon, we estimate that with a tandem axle truck tank you will be able to haul just over 3000 gallons in most states. For trailers the capacity will be around 5,000 gallons."}]
