In South America they are called pampas, and are located in Argentina and Uruguay. In South Africa temperate grasslands are known as veldts. WEATHER: Temperatures in this biome vary greatly between summer and winter. Temperate grasslands have some of the darkest, richest soils in the world (not in wealth, but in nutrients). People who live in grassland regions often use these soils for farming.
