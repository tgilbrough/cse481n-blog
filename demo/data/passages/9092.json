Regular insoles are purely designed to provide a cushioning effect and shock absorption.

Shoe inserts are orthotics that are intended to correct an abnormal or irregular walking pattern, by altering slightly the angles at which the foot strikes a walking or running surface."}, {"url": "http://www.apma.org/Learn/FootHealth.cfm?ItemNumber=988", "passage_text": "Orthotics typically cost more than shoe inserts purchased in a retail store, but the additional cost is usually well worth it. Unlike shoe inserts, orthotics are molded to fit each individual foot, so you can be sure that your orthotics fit and do what they're supposed to do. Prescription orthotics are also made of top-notch materials and last many years when cared for properly."}, {"url": "http://www.footminders.com/what-are-orthotics.html", "passage_text": "Orthotics (also known as orthotic insoles, shoe inserts, or orthoses) are devices placed inside the shoes with the purpose of restoring our natural foot function.
