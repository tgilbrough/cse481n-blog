Average new home construction costs are approximately $100 per square foot. State averages range from $75 to $130 dollars. These figures are somewhat deceptive though, as are all averages. Obviously as with all averages, some cost a lot more and some cost a lot less. Luxury home can cost over $800 per square foot, and even though these are not common, they drive up the average cost."}, {"url": "http://www.buildingsguide.com/faq/what-average-commercial-building-cost-square-foot", "passage_text": "An average commercial steel building costs between $16 and $20 per square foot, including building package (I-Beams, purlins, girts etc.) , delivery, foundation and the cost of construction."}, {"url": "http://architecture.about.com/cs/buildyourhouse/a/costs.htm", "passage_text": "Take the price of the home, deduct the price of the land, and divide that amount by the square footage of the home. For example, if the home is selling for $230,000 and the land costs $30,000, then the construction cost is around $200,000. If the home is 2,000 square feet, then the cost per square foot is $100. Use several new homes in your area to get an approximate square footage price."}, {"url": "http://www.trulia.com/voices/Remodel_and_Renovate/Average_cost_per_square_foot_for_new_construction-381372", "passage_text": "New construction will run between $250 per square foot and $500 per square foot: That will mean between $275,000 to $550,000 not including the cost of the land. 0 votes \u2022 Thank \u2022 Flag \u2022 Link \u2022 Thu May 10, 2012."}, {"url": "http://www.b4ubuild.com/faq/faq_0002.shtml", "passage_text": "Home prices of $55, $66, $72, $80, $84, $92, $110, $118, and $328 per square foot combine to produce an average of $112 per square foot, which is probably a reasonable figure for many areas of the country. However, the difference between the lowest figure and the highest is very substantial."}, {"url": "http://www.homeconstructionimprovement.com/new-construction-square-foot-costs/", "passage_text": "Let\u2019s say a foundation that is 28\u2019x50\u2032 costs $15,000. The cost per square foot (of finished home) would be $15,000/1400 = $10.71/SF for the smaller home and $15,000/2800 = $5.36 for the larger home. So this is just one example showing how the square foot costs for new construction are effected by many different aspects."}]
