Catalin is produced by a different manufacturing process, a two-stage process, than other types of phenolic resins. It does not contain fillers, such as sawdust or carbon black. Catalin is transparent, near colorless, rather than opaque. Unlike other phenolics, it can be produced in bright colors or even marbled. Catalin jewelry, more commonly referred to incorrectly as Bakelite jewelry, was made from the 1930s until the end of WWII when it became too expensive, as every piece had to be individually cast and polished.
