It is chloroprene that binds all the molecules of this reaction together, leaving us with polychloroprene chips. These chips are melted and mixed together with foaming agents and carbon pigments, and then baked in an oven to make it expand. In technical terms neoprene is a type of polymer (a large molecule composed of repeating structural units) known as polychloroprene that is produced by the polymerization (chemical reaction) of chloroprene (an organic compound of colourless liquid with the formula CH2=CCl-CH=CH2)."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/about_6587118_neoprene-made_.html", "passage_text": "Processing.

Neoprene is often referred to as 'rubber' but it is actually plastic. It begins as a powder called polychloroprene. To this base are added other ingredients that provide elasticity, foaming agents, cell size, color, adhesion, bulk, plus other properties. This mixture is made into a dough which is put into a heat press. INSIDE Neoprene. Neoprene is a modern miracle! There is no other fabric with all these qualities: it stretches, it's waterproof, it can be stitched or glued, it comes in a multitude of colors, it provides an insulating layer in wet environments, it's abrasion resistant and it is relatively inexpensive."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-neoprene-rubber.htm", "passage_text": "There are different types of neoprene available, some are made from natural rubber and some made from synthetic rubber. The neoprene made from natural rubber will contain the latex protein that people can be allergic too. There are other issues with allergies relating to the materials used on the neoprene.
