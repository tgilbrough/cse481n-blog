The insert method expects an index and the value to be inserted. Here is an example of insert : So we see the value \u2018yes\u2019 was inserted at the index 0 in the list and all the other elements were shifted accordingly. The append method can take one or more elements as input and appends them into the list. 6. Python allows to use mathematical operators like +, * etc to be used with lists. Here are some examples : So we see that through + operator elements could be added to the list and through * operator we can add the complete list repeatedly towards the end."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/how_8423660_append-list-python.html", "passage_text": "listOfAircraft.append(UFO).
