As a general rule, soft tissue surgery (cysts, nerve releases) will heal in a 2-4 week period. Sutures are typically in for a 14 day period. Many soft tissue procedures are what we call ambulatory meaning that the patient can walk beginning the day of surgery. Bone procedures will take longer to heal. Most bone procedures will require an 8 week period of healing before they become structurally capable of being able to bear load (body weight). This time period does vary widely based upon the nature of the procedure and surgeon preferences."}, {"url": "https://myfootshop.wordpress.com/2009/08/20/foot-surgery-how-long-will-it-take-to-heal-doc/", "passage_text": "For instance, a total hip or knee replacement will be ambulatory within the first few days of surgery.
