The most commonly used root tips in labs to study mitosis are onion, wheat, lentil, barley and alfalfa. An onion root tip is a rapidly growing part of the onion and thus many cells will be in different stages of mitosis. The onion root tips can be prepared and squashed in a way that allows them to be flattened on a microscopic slide, so that the chromosomes of individual cells can be observed easily."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/In_what_region_of_the_onion_root_tip_does_mitosis_occur", "passage_text": "follow this procedure..   1.Collect two onion root tips and trim so that you have about 2 mm of the very tip.     2.Soak the tips in a few drops of 1 M HCl in \u2026 a watch glass for about 10 min.     3.Transfer the tips to a few drops of acetocarmine stain for about 15 min.     4.Transfer one tip to a few drops of water on a slide.

This restricts your search to the tips of growing plants such as the onion root tip or, in the case of animals, to rapidly dividing tissue such as developing embryos. Roots consist of different regions. To estimate the relative length of time that a cell spends in the various stages of cell replication, you will examine the mereistematic region of a prepared slide of the onion root tip. The length of the cell cycle is approximately 24 hours or 1440 minutes for cells in actively dividing onion root tips."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/In_which_region_of_the_root_tip_does_mitosis_occur", "passage_text": "The root tip is on the bottom of the Zone of elongation and the zone of elongation is where the cells are and the cells push the zone of elongation and the root tip gets the w \u2026 ater and sends the water through the xylem into the plant.
