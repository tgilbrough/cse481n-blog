A good way to assess the age of both young and juvenile kittens is to check the presence and development of her teeth. A kitten with no teeth is likely a newborn, younger than 2 weeks of age. If teeth are present, you can still estimate the age based on the number and characteristics of the teeth."}, {"url": "http://www.wikihow.com/Tell-How-Old-a-Kitten-Is", "passage_text": "1 Kittens do not open their eyes until they reach about ten to 14 days in age, but some do open their eyes as early as 7 to 10 days. 2  If your kitten has closed eyes, he is likely a newborn. 3  If your kitten has already opened its eyes, she is at least a full week old.

A female cat will tell you she is experiencing estrus very visibly and vocally. According to PetEducation.com, length of daylight and weight of the cat also have some effect on the time of the queen's first estrus cycle. In older cats, the amount of staining (tartar) is also an indicator of age, which veterinarian's use.

Your kitten grows fast. He\u2019ll reach adolescence much sooner than a human child.

An average cat\u2019s life expectancy is around 17 years, and a human\u2019s is around 84 years. This leads to a rough equivalency of five-to-one. But it is not an apples-to-apples comparison.

Puberty (the age at which animals can reproduce) in the cat ranges from 4 to 12 months, with the average being 6 to 9 months. At puberty, cats are generally about 75% of their mature body weight.

So if you open a cat\u2019s mouth and find permanent, white teeth, the feline is likely to be around a year old.
