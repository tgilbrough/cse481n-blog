Planetary Nebulae: These are called such because they look like a planet when viewed with a small telescope. One of the best examples of a planetary nebula is the Ring Nebula (M57) in Lyra. Reflection Nebulae: A reflection nebula does not emit any visible light of its own, and shines only because the light from an embedded source illuminates its dust. "}, {"url": "http://cas.sdss.org/dr4/en/astro/stars/stars.asp", "passage_text": "In some nebulae, stars form out of large clouds of gas and dust; once some stars have formed inside the cloud, their light illuminates the cloud, making it visible to us. These star formation regions are sites of emission and reflection nebulae, like the famous Orion Nebula shown in the picture on the right. Not surprisingly, these are called dark nebulae. Another type of nebula, called a planetary nebula, results from the death of a star. When a star has burned through so much material that it can no longer sustain its own fusion reactions, the star's gravity causes it to collapse."}, {"url": "http://www.cosmiclight.com/galleries/nebulae.html", "passage_text": "The name planetary nebula refers only to the round shape that many of these objects show when examined through a small visual telescope. In reality, these nebulae have little or nothing to do with planets, but are instead huge shells of gas ejected by stars as they near the ends of their lifetimes. NGC 3132 is nearly half a light year in diameter, and at a distance of about 2000 light years is one of the nearer known planetary nebulae. The Unveiling of a Planetary Nebula.

Our Sun will probably produce a planetary nebula in about 5 thousand million years. They have nothing at all to do with planets; the terminology was invented because they often look a little like planets in small telescopes. The gas and dust in the nebula emits light because it is irradiated by nearby emerging stars. Located at a distance of about 1,600 light years, the Orion nebula is the brightest diffuse nebula in the sky, visible to the naked eye."}, {"url": "http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic0101/", "passage_text": "This dramatic NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope image, showing 10 times more detail, reveals the 'ant's body' as a pair of fiery lobes protruding from a dying, Sun-like star.

It has a relatively small size (some 0.16 light-year across, one-tenth the size of most other known planetary nebula). However, it is about 130 times larger than our Solar System and is continuously expanding. As the nebula continues to move away from the star, the core of the star \u2013 which has become a white dwarf \u2014 is heated and illuminates the gas. Forty years ago the Stingray nebula was still a protoplanetary nebula in which the gas had not yet become hot and ionized."}]
