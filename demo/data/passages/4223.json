In addition to improving soil fertility, annelids serve humans as food and as bait. Each segment has the same sets of organs and, in most polychaetes, has a pair of parapodia that many species use for locomotion. Septa separate the segments of many species, but are poorly defined or absent in others, and Echiura and Sipuncula show no obvious signs of segmentation."}, {"url": "http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/annelida/polyintro.html", "passage_text": "the bristleworms. Of the approximately 9000 species of annelids, more than 8000 are polychaetes. These segmented worms are among the most common marine organisms, and can be found living in the depths of the ocean, floating free near the surface, or burrowing in the mud and sand of the beach. The delicate beauty of many polychaetes make them a favored subject for photography, and several are named after nymphs and goddesses of Greek myth, such as Nereis (the common clam worm) and Aphrodite (the sea mouse).

The annelids include earthworms, polychaete worms, and leeches.

The Clitellata contains the earthworms (which includes terrestial, freshwater, and marine species) and leeches (which are also terrestrial, freshwater, and marine). The longest polychaetes have been known to be up to 200 feet long, although these are very threadlike. The vast majority of polychaetes, however, range from less than one third of an inch to only several inches in length. This is why they are so easily overlooked when one is casually exploring the sea shore."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annelid", "passage_text": "Most textbooks still use the traditional division into polychaetes (almost all marine), oligochaetes (which include earthworms) and leech-like species.
