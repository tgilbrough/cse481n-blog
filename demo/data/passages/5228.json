Anaerobic respiration means an energy cycle with less efficiency to produce energy. Aerobic respiration is energy given off by a complex process when O2 and glucose metabolize together inside the cell\u2019s mitochondria. Summary: 1. Aerobic bacteria inhales oxygen to remain alive. 2. Anaerobic bacteria dies in the presence of oxygen, and therefore avoids O2. 3. Aerobic respiration produces energy with the help of a complex process in the cells. 4. Anaerobic respiration produces crystals, and causes pain in muscled areas."}, {"url": "http://www.differencebetween.net/science/health/difference-between-aerobic-and-anaerobic-cellular-respiration/", "passage_text": "Aerobic respiration requires oxygen in order to generate energy molecule ATP, where as an anaerobic respiration synthesize ATP by using the electron transport chain, with inorganic molecules other than oxygen. Anaerobic Respiration is typically referred to as fermentation and no oxygen is used in the process. In the process of Yeast fermentation or anaerobic respiration, the most sugars are broken to yield ethanol and carbon dioxide. Aerobic respiration on the other hand, almost all eukaryotic and many prokaryotic organisms are solely dependent upon a continuous supply of oxygen molecules to sustain life."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Difference_between_anaerobic_and_Aerobic_respiration_with_horse", "passage_text": "Aerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration that uses the oxygen in order to break down the molecules, which then release electrons and creating energy.

Both begin through a process called Glycolosis in which a glucose molecule is \u2026 split into two pyruvate molecules. The main difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration occurs after glycolosis. Aerobic respiration occurs if there is oxygen present. Aerobic respiration creates the most ATP since oxidative phosphorylation is able to occur. Anaerobic respiration occurs if there is no oxygen present and creates less ATP. So in a nutshell, the main difference is whether or not oxygen is present. Making the world better, one answer at a time. Aerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration that uses the oxygen in order to break down the molecules, which then release electrons and creating energy. Anaerobic respiration does not need the oxygen."}, {"url": "http://www.fitness19.com/aerobic-and-anaerobic-exercise-what-is-the-difference/", "passage_text": "During anaerobic exercise your body builds up lactic acid, which causes discomfort and fatigue at sustained levels. For this reason anaerobic exercise or high intensity exercise happens in short bursts. It may be helpful to consider the difference between a sprinter (anaerobic) and a marathoner (aerobic). Sprinting is an all-out effort that is sustained for a comparatively short period while marathoning is a sustained effort."}, {"url": "http://www.differencebetween.net/science/difference-between-aerobic-and-anaerobic-bacteria/", "passage_text": "Aerobic vs Anaerobic Bacteria. There are two types of organisms and tiny single-celled bacteria called aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the human body. Aerobics are able to use oxygen, whereas anaerobic bacteria can sustain itself without the presence of oxygen. Summary: 1. Aerobic bacteria inhales oxygen to remain alive. 2. Anaerobic bacteria dies in the presence of oxygen, and therefore avoids O2. 3. Aerobic respiration produces energy with the help of a complex process in the cells. 4.

When there is no oxygen available to break the sugar molecules, some cells are still able to produce energy by the process called fermentation or anaerobic cellular respiration or anaerobic glycolysis. Certain organisms do not need molecular oxygen to produce the energy molecules called ATP. In the process of Yeast fermentation or anaerobic respiration, the most sugars are broken to yield ethanol and carbon dioxide.

Aerobic respiration, a process that uses oxygen, and anaerobic respiration, a process that doesn't use oxygen, are two forms of cellular respiration. Although some cells may engage in just one type of respiration, most cells use both types, depending on an organism's needs. Anaerobic respiration is respiration without oxygen; the process uses a respiratory electron transport chain but does not use oxygen as the electron acceptors."}]
