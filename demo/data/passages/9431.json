Function: Dendrites receives impulses from axon of another neurone through synapse and conducts the impulse towards the cell body ,therefore it is called the receptive organ."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/facts_5804702_structure-function-nerve-cell.html", "passage_text": "A nerve cell, or neuron, is the basic unit of the nervous system. It transmits information to and from the brain. The structure of a neuron allows the transmission to be quick. 1  The Structure & Function of Muscle Cells. 2  What Is the Function of Blood Cells? Structure. Nerve cells consist of a cell body, axon and dendrites. The cell body contains the nucleus and other cellular compartments. The axon is long and surrounded by a layer of fat."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-are-nerve-cells-function-types-structure.html", "passage_text": "Instructor: John Williams. Nerve cells are the primary cells in the nervous system. They are responsible for relaying electrical messages to cells and tissues in other organ systems. This article discusses the functions and structures of nerve cells in the human body. Neurons are nerve cells, or cells found in the nervous system. These are specialized cells designed to stimulate other cells in the body in order to communicate. Neurons are excitable, which means they function by using electrical stimulation"}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_does_the_structure_of_a_nerve_cell_relate_to_its_function", "passage_text": "Nerve cells have several adaptations to their function. The basic function of the cell is do deliver a message to the next nerve cell in order to send information across the body. The ways in which it is adapted to do this are as follows: - long axon so can deliver an action potential a long way.
