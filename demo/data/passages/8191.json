It's because of the holdback amount that most manufacturers assign to a car. The holdback is a percentage of the sticker price or invoice price. Manufacturers pay it to the dealer after he sells a car. This means that a dealer could sell a car at invoice price, tell the customer that's he not making one penny on the deal and still get a check from the manufacturer a month later for $500. It's basically the price that the dealer would like you to pay for the car. Invoice Price: This is roughly what the dealer paid the carmaker for the vehicle.

For example, a car with a $25,000 MSRP might have an invoice price of around $23,000, meaning that the dealer likely owns the car for $23,000. That means the dealer has a profit margin of around $2,000. Given that the invoice price is the dealership's cost on the car, you can't always find a dealer that's willing to sell the car for less than that.
