The reticular formation is not anatomically well defined because it includes neurons located in diverse parts of the brain. The neurons of the reticular formation all play a crucial role in maintaining behavioral arousal and consciousness. The functions of the reticular formation are modulatory and premotor. The modulatory functions are primarily found in the rostral sector of the reticular formation and the premotor functions are localized in the neurons in more caudal regions."}, {"url": "http://psychlopedia.wikispaces.com/reticular+formation", "passage_text": "1 The part of the brain that keeps you alert. 2  Helps you pay attention to new stimulation. 3  Connected to the thalamus. 4  The reticular formation is a group of nerve fibers located inside the brain stem.
