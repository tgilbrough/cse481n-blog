Cheesemaking involves coagulating the casein protein in milk and then separating the milk into solid curds and liquid whey. The liquid whey is drained away, and the curds are salted, shaped and left to ripen in a controlled environment. However, for most cheeses, rennet is also added to the milk after a starter bacteria. Rennet is a mixture containing the active enzyme chymosin. Rennet speeds up the coagulation of casein and produces a stronger curd."}, {"url": "http://idahomilkproducts.com/content/how-does-milk-protein-concentrate-differ-casein-or-caseinates", "passage_text": "The casein curd is then washed repeatedly with acidified fresh water to \u201cpurify\u201d the casein (wash away unwanted, occluded milk solids such as fat and lactose). Because the casein curd is kept at an acid pH, the milk minerals are leached out of the protein. The result is a relatively pure protein curd (96% protein on a dry basis). This casein curd, however, is not very useful in food products. Acid casein (as the curd is known) is insoluble in water, behaving much like sand.

Casein has a wide variety of uses, from being a major component of cheese, to use as a food additive, to a binder for safety matches. Since milk's pH is 6.6, casein has a negative charge in milk. The purified protein is water-insoluble. While it is also insoluble in neutral salt solutions, it is readily dispersible in dilute alkalis and in salt solutions such as sodium oxalate and sodium acetate."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casein", "passage_text": "The isoelectric point of casein is 4.6.

It is often listed as sodium caseinate, calcium caseinate, or milk protein, whey, whey protein concentrate, and many more. The biggest and baddest source of casein (in my experience) is called Milk Protein Concentrate (MPC). Curds of this description are rarely seen unless proportion of casein in the food is high. Curds of the first variety, if numerous, call for a considerable reduction in the amount of fat. The large, smooth, hard curds, if numerous and persistent, may usually be made to disappear by boiling the milk."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-casein.htm", "passage_text": "Casein is a protein that is found in milk and used independently in many foods as a binding agent. Technically, it is part of a group called phosphoproteins, collections of proteins bound to something containing phosphoric acid. It may also be called caseinogen, particularly in European foods. "}]
