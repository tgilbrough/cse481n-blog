A standard deviation of a sample estimates the standard deviation of a population based on a random sample. The sample standard deviation, unlike the population standard deviation, is a statistic that measures the dispersion of the data around the sample mean. Standard deviation refers to the amount of dispersion in a given data set. Researchers calculate the standard deviation of a data set by taking the square root of the variance, and the numerical result is indicated by the letter S. They use the term \u201cvariance\u201d to describe the extent of the data spread."}, {"url": "http://onlinestatbook.com/2/sampling_distributions/samplingdist_diff_means.html", "passage_text": "Figure 2.
