A distinction is sometimes made between paracrine and autocrine signaling"}, {"url": "http://www.fastbleep.com/biology-notes/31/174/997", "passage_text": "Examples include autocrine, where the cell signals to itself, and paracrine, where a cell signals to a nearby neighbour. However, when cells need to communicate a message over a long distance, they can use the endocrine system. Endocrine signalling uses chemicals called hormones to send messages throughout the body. The hormones are released from the cell into the bloodstream and can travel around the entire body. There are many types of hormones-the chemicals which are responsible for endocrine signalling. Like most signalling pathways, hormones will bind to receptors on specific cells. This will produce the desired response within the cell."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracrine_signalling", "passage_text": "Paracrine signaling is a form of cell-cell communication in which a cell produces a signal to induce changes in nearby cells, altering the behavior or differentiation of those cells.

Autocrine refers to chemicals released from a cell that have an action on that same cell (like negative feedback, where a cell releases a chemical that hits receptors on the same cell, and stops further release of the chemical). Oxytocin is one of the two major hormones which are secreted from an area of the brain called the posterior pituitary (the other one is called vasopressin, and is involved in water regulation, though it also has been known to curl the toes of male voles)."}]
