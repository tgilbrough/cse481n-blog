They are divided into the shallower coastal benthic and the deep ocean benthic habitats found beyond the continental shelf. Coral reefs are a benthic habitat in shallow, warm waters where an abundance of light penetrates. Here, no light penetrates and plants are not found. Organisms living in this ocean habitat are primarily detritus eaters, subsisting on the organic matter that floats to the bottom of the sea. Little studied due to the difficulties involved, this deep area is believed to be rich in biodiversity."}, {"url": "http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/about/habitat_types/habitats/oceans/", "passage_text": "The floor of the ocean is called the benthic habitat while the water itself is called the pelagic habitat.

Marine life depends in some way on the saltwater that is in the sea (the term marine comes from the Latin mare, meaning sea or ocean). A habitat is an ecological or environmental area inhabited by one or more living species. Marine habitats can be divided into coastal and open ocean habitats. Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from as far as the tide comes in on the shoreline out to the edge of the continental shelf. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area."}, {"url": "http://marinelife.about.com/od/habitatprofiles/tp/majormarinehabitats.htm", "passage_text": "\u2022 The Open Ocean (Pelagic Zone).
