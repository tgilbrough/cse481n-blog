[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_chloride", "passage_text": "Calcium chloride can serve as a source of calcium ions in an aqueous solution, as calcium chloride is soluble in water. This property can be useful for displacing ions from solution. For example, phosphate is displaced from solution by calcium: CaCl 2(l) \u2192 Ca (s) + Cl 2(g). Calcium chloride has a very high enthalpy change of solution. A considerable temperature rise accompanies its dissolution in water. The anhydrous salt is deliquescent; it can accumulate enough water in its crystal lattice to form a solution."}, {"url": "http://www.rxlist.com/calcium-chloride-drug/indications-dosage.htm", "passage_text": "INDICATIONS.
