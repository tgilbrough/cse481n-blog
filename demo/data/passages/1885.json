It is produced in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain. It acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain's cortex, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The brain produces roughly 500 mL of cerebrospinal fluid per day. This fluid is constantly reabsorbed, so that only 100-160 mL is present at any one time."}, {"url": "http://neuropathology-web.org/chapter14/chapter14CSF.html", "passage_text": "THE NORMAL CSF. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced from arterial blood by the choroid plexuses of the lateral and fourth ventricles by a combined process of diffusion, pinocytosis and active transfer. A small amount is also produced by ependymal cells. The volume of the ventricles is about 25 ml. CSF is produced at a rate of 0.2 - 0.7 ml per minute or 600-700 ml per day. The circulation of CSF is aided by the pulsations of the choroid plexus and by the motion of the cilia of ependymal cells."}, {"url": "http://www.anaesthesiamcq.com/FluidBook/fl3_6.php", "passage_text": "The CSF is formed by the choroid plexus (50%) and directly from the walls of the ventricules (50%).

Like saliva it is a filtrate of blood. It is also found inside the subarachnoid space of the meninges which surrounds both the brain and the spinal chord. The choroid plexuses are formed by the fusion of the pia mater, the most internal layer of the meninges and the ependyma, the lining of the ventricles. The Ventricles These four spaces are filled with cerebrospinal fluid and protect the brain by cushioning it and supporting its weight."}, {"url": "http://www.angelfire.com/wa/wafshaf50/CSF.html", "passage_text": "Formation: Clinical and experimental observation has established that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is mainly formed by secretion from the choroid plexuses of the cerebral ventricles. Circulation: That formed by the plexuses of the lateral ventricle passes through the interventricular formina into the third ventricle. "}]
