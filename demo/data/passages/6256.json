end tendons are designed to only stretch a small amount their job is to transmit force between the bones and the muscles for example when the biceps muscle on the front top of the arm contracts the tendon attached to the biceps muscle and elbow bone helps the muscle to pull on the elbow bones so the joint can bend "}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091004145059AAkRoK9", "passage_text": "answers best answer these are the answer i got from wikipedia a tendon is a tough band of fibrous connective tissue that usually connects muscle to bone and is capable of withstanding tension a joint is the location at which two or more bones make contact a ligament is a short band of tough fibrous dense regular connective tissue composed mainly of long stringy collagen fibers ligaments connect bones to other bones to form a joint"}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-the-difference-between-a-ligament-and-a-tendon.htm", "passage_text": "on one level there is not much difference organically between a ligament and a tendon both are formed from chains of collagen cells produced by proteins stored in the body this is where the similarity stops however a ligament acts much like a shock absorber and connects bone to bone ad one difference between a ligament and a tendon injury is the type of surgery which may be required a torn tendon may cause the entire attached muscle group to fail"}, {"url": "http://www.differencebetween.net/science/difference-between-ligaments-and-tendons/", "passage_text": "two of these structures that aid in movement and attachment of bone to other structures are ligaments and tendons people do sometimes confuse these words so for the convenience of everyone we shall differentiate the two words a ligament is a fibrous structure that connects bone to bone tendons on the other hand hold bones to muscles that is actually the main difference ligaments are actually fibrous structures which are strong and lengthy which in turn hold both of the bones together well "}, {"url": "http://www.umich.edu/~bme332/ch10ligten/bme332ligamenttendon.htm", "passage_text": "ligaments and tendons are soft collagenous tissues ligaments
