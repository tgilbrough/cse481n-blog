To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member. Peristalsis moves food along the small intestine, but we also see two other movements within the organ. While these two movements do not push the food along the tract like peristalsis, they do mix the chyme with the digestive juices and bring particles of food into contact with the wall where they can be absorbed."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/movement-through-the-small-intestine-peristalsis-segmentation-pendular-movement.html", "passage_text": "The small intestine is an important organ for digestion and absorption of nutrients. In this lesson you will learn about the enterogastric reflex. You will also learn how intestinal movements, such as peristalsis, segmentation, and pendular movement, improve digestion and absorption.

The main functions of the digestive system is \u2026 to digest the foods you eat, absorbs those nutrients from the foods you eat, and disposes of the waste product (poop). The digestive system refers to the system from the mouth to the  bowels. It is the system that the body used to draw nutrients from  food and to eliminate waste.

Physical digestion is the physical breakdown of food, using your teeth, called mastication. Chemical digestion uses different fluids and chemicals in your body to break down the food further, such as pepsin and hydrochloric acid.

In zoology, segmentation refers to the division of a body part into segments. It may be homomeric segmentation in which the segments are more or less the same, or heteromeric segmentation wherein the segments differ from one another. Word origin: Latin segmentum + atio (process). Related term(s): 1  Segment. noun, plural: segmentation. (1) (embryology) Cleavage, i.e. the repeated division of a fertilized ovum forming blastomeres. (2) (zoology) The division of animal or plant body into repetitive segments; metamerism or the state of developing segments or a series of repeating parts."}, {"url": "http://pathwayofasandwich.weebly.com/segmentation.html", "passage_text": "1 As a result of segmentation; a process by which some physical digestion occurs in the small intestine, the chime sloshes back and forth between segments of the small intestine that form when bands of circular muscle briefly contract. 2  A helpful animation that outlines the process of peristalsis and segmentation. 1 This image illustrates the segmentation of the chyme that occurs within the small intestine of the digestive tract. 2  Segmentation is the process of mixing the food contents in the digestive tract to create a more uniform mixture throughout."}]
