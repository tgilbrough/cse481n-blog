The leaflets in the mitral and tricuspid valves are supported by: 1  Annulus: tough fibrous ring attached to the leaflets that help support and maintain the proper shape of the valve. 2  Chordae tendineae: tough, fibrous strings. 3  These are similar to the strings supporting a parachute."}, {"url": "http://www.heartcaremw.com/services/heart-valve-clinics/diseases-treatments.html", "passage_text": "The heart is divided into four main areas, or chambers \u2013 two upper chambers (called the left and right atrium) and two lower chambers (called the left and right ventricle).

Heart valves are situated around the fibrous rings of the cardiac skeleton. The valves incorporate leaflets or cusps, which are pushed open to allow blood flow and which then close together to seal and prevent backflow. A heart valve normally allows blood to flow in only one direction through the heart. The four valves commonly represented in a mammalian heart determine the pathway of blood flow through the heart.

Regurgitation is also called insufficiency or incompetence. Regurgitation happens when a valve doesn't close properly and blood leaks backward instead of moving in the proper one-way flow. Every time your heart beats, blood flows into, through, and out of your heart. In fact, your heart moves about 100 gallons (379 liters) of blood through your body every hour. Two types of problems can disrupt blood flow though the valves: regurgitation or stenosis."}]
