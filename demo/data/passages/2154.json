And while the walls should also last the lifetime of the house, aluminum windows are only expected to hang around for 15 to 20 years. Wooden windows should last as long as 30 years. Your garage door opener won't have as lucky of a fate, however.

The typical dishwasher can be expected to last between seven and 12 years, with the average working expectancy being nine to 10 years. Certain factors, such as cost, quality, brand, care, maintenance and frequency of usage, can affect the life expectancy of a dishwasher. While your particular model may last for a longer or shorter duration than the average expectancy, it is good to have an idea of the average time you can expect your appliance to last. This will give you an idea of when the dishwasher will need to be replaced and help you to budget accordingly"}, {"url": "http://blogs.hrblock.com/2013/10/21/the-life-expectancy-of-7-major-appliances/", "passage_text": "I\u2019m wondering if manufacturers have taken such numbers into consideration and as a result take efforts to make sure your appliance does not last that long.

According to the results, the average lifespan for a modern dishwasher is just nine years. Although my Maytag was working well up until the accident, I purchased it back in 2001 and it appears to be bumping up against its expiration date. Fortunately, the contractor's insurance should cover the structural damage. But I still need to either fix my appliance -- which will cost me a couple hundred dollars -- or buy a new one, which could run as high as $900.

I've had my US Maytag dishwasher JetClean do well for almost 10 years. I think they're supposed to last anywhere from 8-15 years, more or less, depending on how much you use it, probably. I don't know about the pumps, sorry. If you suscribe to Consumer Reports, maybe they would have info on that. How long do the pumps usually last in Maytag\u2019s and is this good value? I think she payed \u00a3600 new it\u2019s in good condition apart from a few cracks on the lcd buttons and display."}]
