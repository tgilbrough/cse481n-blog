In contrast to this, a nonlinear equation will have a graph that does not have a straight line and, depending on the function, can have many different appearances including a U-shape or an S-shape."}, {"url": "http://www.montereyinstitute.org/courses/Algebra1/COURSE_TEXT_RESOURCE/U03_L2_T5_text_final.html", "passage_text": "In Function 2, the graph is a straight line, so it is a linear function. Summary. We\u2019ve explored a few different kinds of nonlinear functions. Like linear functions, inverse relation, quadratic, and exponential functions can help us model real world situations and understand them better. Unlike linear functions, the rate of change in nonlinear functions is not constant but variable."}, {"url": "http://math.tutorvista.com/calculus/nonlinear-function.html", "passage_text": "Most basically, the functions can be classified into two types -(1) Linear Functions(2) Nonlinear FunctionsLinear functions are the functions having a degree of one.
