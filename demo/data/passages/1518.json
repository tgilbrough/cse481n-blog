Normal temperature is usually defined as 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (F) or 37 degrees Celsius (C).

This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1\u00b0F (0.6\u00b0C) or more above or below 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C) . Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1\u00b0F (0.6\u00b0C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day.

A fever is a high temperature when the body's temperature rises above 37.5C (99.5F). The normal body temperature is between 36C-37C (96.8F-98.6F). The high temperature or fever often lasts around two to three days. Check for high temperature or fever using an appropriate thermometer and following the instructions.
