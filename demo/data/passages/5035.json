It is found in every cell may it be human, animal, plant or fungus. Inside the nucleus of each human cell (excluding the sex cells) you will find 23 pairs (NOT 13) of chomosomes. Chromosomes are made up of very, very long strands of DNA wound up like rope very tightly. A and T and C and G fit together, and they form a ladder-like double helix shape.
