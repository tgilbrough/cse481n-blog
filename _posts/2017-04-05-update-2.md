### [](#header-3)Tensorflow

[Tensorflow Installation Instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux)

We installed Tensorflow 1.0 with GPU support. The installation process was very easy and straightforward.
Attaching Tensorflow to the GPU was fairly as well by installing the tensorflow-gpu package.

#### [](#header-4)Uses

*   Provides a robust API for plenty of deep learning algorithms
*   Contains a variety of easy to use deep learning architectures (e.g. LSTM, GRU, CNNs, etc.)
*   Provides GPU support
*   We are using TF because:
    *   Open-source and well documented
    *   Arguably the most popular deep learning library within the machine learning community, providing a lot of good starting code for different ML and NLP projects.

### [](#header-3)word2vec

[word2vec Installation Instructions](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html)

#### [](#header-4)Uses

*   Ability to convert words to vectors that have been pre-trained on giant corpora
*   Converting words to vectors is essential in order to use deep learning and capture semantics of words
*   Huge dimensionality reduction from one-hot vocabulary encoding

* * *

### [](#header-3)NLTK

[NLTK Installation Instructions](http://www.nltk.org/install.html)

#### [](#header-4)Uses

*   Tons of built-in utility functions such as word tokenizers and POS taggers
*   Easy to use sentiment analysis tools

* * *

### [](#header-3)The Stanford Parser

[The Stanford Parser installation instructions](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/wiki/Installing-Third-Party-Software)

Parser can be easily used by downloading the English models from the above link and referring to them in
the NLTK package which provides the parser.

#### [](#header-4)Uses

*   Dependency and syntatic parsers that work with NLTK
*   Parses would be useful to further analyze and extract features from question in QA system
