As a procurement tool, it has some aspects that are similar to an electronic framework agreement, but where new suppliers can join at any time.

The buyer must usually evaluate a tender within 15 days of having received it and submit it to the Dynamic Purchasing System. This evaluation must include all tenders that match the specification. Once admitted, the supplier may improve a tender at any time but new providers can still join the DPS too."}, {"url": "http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110601212617/http:/ogc.gov.uk/documents/OGC_Guidance_on_Dynamic_Purchasing_Systems.pdf", "passage_text": "1.

Yes; where a dynamic purchasing system is divided into categories, the contracting authority should apply selection criteria that are proportionate and relevant to the characteristics of the category concerned.

An example use of a dynamic purchasing system is a purchase of taxi routes through a city. The system itself will create the list of suppliers who are able to provide the service and suppliers submit indicative bids for the main project. In a full tender however, the contract would be awarded to one or a small number of suppliers, who would therefore not necessarily be the most appropriate for each area within the contract. The commonly cited disadvantage of DPS is that it must be an open and electronic process."}, {"url": "http://grahnlaw.blogspot.com/2008/12/dynamic-purchasing-system-in-eu.html", "passage_text": "Against this background, it is necessary to define a completely electronic dynamic purchasing system for commonly used purchases, and lay down specific rules for setting up and operating such a system in order to ensure the fair treatment of any economic operator who wishes to take part therein.
