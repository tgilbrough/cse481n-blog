It is made up of a group of organs that transport blood throughout the body. The heart pumps the blood and the arteries and veins transport it. Oxygen-rich blood leaves the left side of the heart and enters the biggest artery, called the aorta. The aorta branches into smaller arteries, which then branch into even smaller vessels that travel all over the body."}, {"url": "http://www.innerbody.com/image/cardov.html", "passage_text": "The heart is a pumping system which takes in deoxygenated blood through the veins and delivers it to the lungs for oxygenation before pumping it into the various arteries (which provide oxygen and nutrients to body tissues by transporting the blood throughout the body).

Hemoglobin is the gas transporting protein molecule that makes up 95% of a red cell. As a consequence, fetal hemoglobin molecules attract and transport relatively more oxygen to the cells of the body. White Cells.

In the human body, the oxygen is absorbed by the blood stream in the lungs, being then transported to the cells where an elaborated change process takes place. Oxygen plays a vital role in the breathing processes and in the metabolism of the living organisms. In the human body, oxygen uptake is carried out by the following processes: Oxygen diffuses through membranes and into red blood cells after inhalation into the lungs. The heme group (that consists of an iron) of hemoglobin binds oxygen when it is present, changing haemoglobin\u2019s color from bluish red to bright red."}, {"url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Human_Physiology/Blood_physiology", "passage_text": "Overview of Blood [edit].
