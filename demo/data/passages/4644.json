Examples of monosaccharides include glucose (dextrose), fructose (levulose) and galactose. Monosaccharides are the building blocks of disaccharides (such as sucrose and lactose) and polysaccharides (such as cellulose and starch). With few exceptions (e.g., deoxyribose), monosaccharides have this chemical formula: C x (H 2 O) y, where conventionally x \u2265 3. Monosaccharides can be classified by the number x of carbon atoms they contain: diose (2) triose (3) tetrose (4), pentose (5), hexose (6), heptose (7), and so on."}, {"url": "http://www.ivyroses.com/HumanBiology/Nutrition/Types-of-Sugar.php", "passage_text": "The two main categories of sugars are monosaccharides and disaccharides. They are often described together with polysaccharides, and sometimes also oligosaccarides, due to the chemical relationship between these types of carbohydrates: 1  Categories of sugars 2  : Monosaccharides are simple (unit) sugars.

Three common references are sucrose, lactose, and maltose. Disaccharide is one of the four chemical groupings of carbohydrates (monosaccharide, disaccharide, oligosaccharide, and polysaccharide). Disaccharides are formed when two monosaccharides are joined together and a molecule of water is removed, a process known as dehydration reaction. For example; milk sugar (lactose) is made from glucose and galactose whereas the sugar from sugar cane and sugar beets (sucrose) is made from glucose and fructose."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.org/what-are-monosaccharides.htm", "passage_text": "You won't believe these 10 facts about people. Monosaccharides are a type of simple carbohydrate, or simple sugar. The word comes from the Greek manos, or single, and sacchar, sugar.

The simplest form of carbohydrates are monosaccharides. Monosaccharides are the simplest units of carbohydrates and the simplest form of sugar. They are the building blocks of more complex carbohydrates such as disaccharides and polysaccharides. Physically, they are usually colorless, can dissolve in water and have the appearance of a crystal-like substance. "}]
