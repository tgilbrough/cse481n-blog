The serum can be defined as the clear or yellowish fluid found inside the seroma; it is made up of plasma as well as other cells that come from various blood vessels which become damaged while the surgery is ongoing. It is characterized as a small/ big lump depending on the amount of fluid encased in it."}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/seroma", "passage_text": "A seroma is a collection of fluid that builds up under the surface of your skin. Seromas may develop after a surgical procedure, most often at the site of the surgical incision or where tissue was removed. The fluid, called serum, doesn\u2019t always build up right away. A seroma may form after a surgical procedure. In some cases, a seroma may form after a very minor surgery. Most seromas, though, will appear after a rather extensive procedure, or one in which a lot of tissue is removed or disrupted. Your surgical team will place drainage tubes in and around the incision to try to prevent a seroma"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroma", "passage_text": "A seroma is a pocket of clear serous fluid that sometimes develops in the body after surgery. When small blood vessels are ruptured, blood plasma can seep out; inflammation caused by dying injured cells also contributes to the fluid. Seromas are particularly common after breast surgery (for example after mastectomy), abdominal surgeries, and reconstructive surgery.

Serous fluid is also different from lymph. Seromas can also sometimes be caused by injury, such as when the initial swelling from a blow or fall does not fully subside. The remaining serous fluid causes a seroma that the body usually gradually absorbs over time (often taking many days or weeks); however, a knot of calcified tissue sometimes remains.

Serous fluid is the fluid compartment of blood that seeps out when blood vessels are injured or ruptured during operation.
