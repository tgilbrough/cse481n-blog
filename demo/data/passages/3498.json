A faulty engine speed sensor can be caused by a bad transmission. In most cases, it's found on automatics. This is why it's very important to have your car regularly checked. If a car is experiencing any of the above symptoms, it is always best if you take your car into a local garage and ask them to run computer diagnostic tests on the vehicle to see if the speed sensor is functioning correctly."}, {"url": "http://gadflyofthenation.blogspot.com/2012/03/how-can-you-tell-if-your-car-has-faulty.html", "passage_text": "A faulty vehicle speed sensor can cause a number of problems. The problem often is that these faults or symptoms can be very difficult to diagnose. Sensor faults can appear similar in many ways to other vehicle faults like a defective coil pack or a bad throttle position sensor.

The 45RFE / 545RFE transmissions use two sensors, an input speed sensor and an output speed sensor. Both are the same part number.

This sensor is the same as the input speed sensor, which can be used as a spare in case the input speed sensor fails. John says the failure of the input speed sensor is very unlikely. Fortunately maintaining the Output speed sensor is very easy."}, {"url": "http://freeasestudyguides.com/vehicle-speed-sensors.html", "passage_text": "Vehicle Speed Sensors. Vehicle Speed Sensors come in several different designs depending on the manufacturer. They\u2019re used as sensor input for the ABS and Traction Control systems. It inputs data to the transmission for shift control, cruise control, and ABS (anti-lock brakes) only to name a few. As the shaft of this sensor spins, it generates an on off signal to the vehicles PCM and TCM. The PCM converts this signal into vehicle speed. In later model vehicles this information is shared between computer systems by multiplexing."}, {"url": "http://www.toptransmissions.com/electrical-sensors", "passage_text": "The input speed sensor measures the RPM of the input shaft of the transmission. With the engine running and the vehicle in gear (forward or reverse), if the car or truck is not moving, the input shaft of the transmission is also not moving. This is because the torque converter, which is a fluid drive, allows this effect, which is perceived as 'slipping'. When the input shaft moves, the input speed sensor detects this motion, and wires deliver this signal to the control module. The Vehicle Speed Sensor measures vehicle speed. If it fails or malfunctions the automatic transmission may not operate properly. It may also cause the automatic transmission to go into failsafe mode making it appear that the problem is more severe than it actually is."}]
