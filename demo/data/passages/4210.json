Effects found at a convergent boundary between continental plates include: intense folding and faulting, a broad folded mountain range, shallow earthquake activity, shortening and thickening of the plates within the collision zone."}, {"url": "http://www.enotes.com/homework-help/what-country-an-example-continental-divergent-48089", "passage_text": "(Answer #1). The 3 types of tectonic plate boundaries are convergent, transform, and divergent. A convergent boundary is one where two plates are moving toward each other. Typically one plate is forced beneath the other (ex: the Andes mountains and the Japanese islands). "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_boundary", "passage_text": "In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary (because of subduction), is an actively deforming region where two (or more) tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere move toward one another and collide. When one plate is composed of oceanic lithosphere and the other is composed of continental lithosphere, the denser oceanic plate is subducted, often forming an orogenic belt and associated mountain range. This type of convergent boundary is similar to the Andes or the Cascade Range in North America."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_boundary", "passage_text": "As a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries. When two plates move towards one another, they form either a subduction zone or a continental collision. This depends on the nature of the plates involved. When one plate is composed of oceanic lithosphere and the other is composed of continental lithosphere, the denser oceanic plate is subducted, often forming an orogenic belt and associated mountain range. This type of convergent boundary is similar to the Andes or the Cascade Range in North America."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_boundary", "passage_text": "A subduction zone is formed at a convergent plate boundary when one or both of the tectonic plates is composed of oceanic crust. The denser plate, made of oceanic crust, is subducted underneath the less dense plate, which can be either continental or oceanic crust. When one plate is composed of oceanic lithosphere and the other is composed of continental lithosphere, the denser oceanic plate is subducted, often forming an orogenic belt and associated mountain range.

The Marianas Trench (paralleling the Mariana Islands), for example, marks where the fast-moving Pacific Plate converges against the slower moving Philippine Plate. "}, {"url": "http://geology.com/nsta/convergent-plate-boundaries.shtml", "passage_text": "When a convergent boundary occurs between two oceanic plates one of those plates will subduct beneath the other. Normally the older plate will subduct because of its higher density. The subducting plate is heated as it is forced deeper into the mantle and at a depth of about 100 miles (150 km) the plate begins to melt.

In this case, an underwater trench can form on the oceanic side, and volcanoes and mountains can form on the continental side. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member. The collision of this oceanic and continental plate was how the Andes mountains were formed. Convergent boundaries can also form islands. The northern part of the Pacific Plate is subducting under the North American Plate, and the result is the formation of the Aleutian Islands."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/convergent-boundary-definition-facts-examples.html", "passage_text": "Examples of Convergent Boundaries.
