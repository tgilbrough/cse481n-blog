From a Linguistics viewpoint, recursion can also be called nesting. As I've stated in this answer to what defines a language (third-last bullet point), recursion is a phenomenon where a linguistic rule can be applied to the result of the application of the same rule.. Let's see an example of this.

The Chomskyan view is that this ability is quite special, unique to humans. It is, in essence, what distinguishes us from other animals-the source of complex thought and communication, and thus complex mathematical, artistic and linguistic ability. Abe and Watanabe's study shows that songbirds are able to process a recursive grammar-this is perhaps the most significant aspect of their paper. More on that later.

The distinction is important because there is a long history of argument about UG*, whereas most people working on language agree that there is Universal Grammar.

Generally speaking, recursion refers to the process of having the DNS server itself to make queries to other DNS servers on behalf of the client who made the original request. In essence, the DNS server becomes a DNS client. If the DNS server does not know the address of the requested site, then it will forward the request to another DNS server. In order to do so, the DNS server must know of the IP address of another DNS server that it can forward the request to. This is the job of root hints."}]
