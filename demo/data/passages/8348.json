located along the line between the metals and nonmetals in the periodic table the metalloids are boron silicon germanium arsenic antimony and tellurium polonium is often considered a metalloid tooproperties of the semimetals or metalloids the electronegativities and ionization energies of the metalloids are between those of the metals and nonmetals so the metalloids exhibit characteristics of both classessilicon for example possesses a metallic luster yet it is an inefficient conductor and is brittlehe reactivity of the metalloids depends on the element with which they are reacting for example boron acts as a nonmetal when reacting with sodium yet as a metal when reacting with fluorine the boiling points melting points and densities of the metalloids vary widely"}]
