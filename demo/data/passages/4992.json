If you ask for a relative location you need to state what you want it relative to. For instance Brazil is a very large country in South America, as the previous answerer states, it is west relative to Africa. However it is south relative to North America. Absolute location is also something of a misnomer as this is usually asking for a location in terms of Latitude and Longitude. But once again the co-ordinates are relative to a point in the Atlantic Ocean where the Prime Meridian and the Equator meet. The absolute location of Muscat, Oman (Muscat is the Capital) is: 23.61 N; 58.54 E It is on the Gulf of Oman next to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and across the gulf fr \u2026 om Iran."}]
