An average of 50 to 260 inches (125 to 660 cm.) of rain falls yearly. Rain forests belong to the tropical wet climate group. A tropical rain forest has more kinds of trees than any other area in the world. Scientists have counted about 100 to 300 species in one 2 1/2-acre (1-hectare) area in South America.

Temperate rainforests are found along coasts in temperate regions. The largest temperate rainforests are on the Pacific coast in North America, stretching from Alaska to Oregon. Other temperate rainforests are found along the coast of Chile, the United Kingdom, Norway, Japan, New Zealand, and S. Australia. Tropical rainforests are lush and warm all year long! Temperatures don\u2019t even change much between night and day. The average temperature in tropical rainforests ranges from 70 to 85\u00b0F (21 to 30\u00b0C).

They are found all over the world but the majority of the tropical rainforest lies in South America in Brazil. The weather in the tropical rainforest is rainy yet pleasant all year round, day or night. Rainforests are extremely important because the water they produce is evaporated and then used as rain in other areas. The average temperature of the tropical rainforest remains between 70 and 85\u00b0 F. The tropical rainforest is very rainy as its name implies. The rainfall can reach up to 400 inches in one year."}, {"url": "http://www.cotf.edu/ete/modules/msese/earthsysflr/rforest.html", "passage_text": "Tropical Rainforest The tropical rainforest is a hot, moist biome found near Earth's equator.
