HBOT is a treatment that can be traced back to the 1600s. The first well-known chamber was built and run by a British clergyman named Henshaw. Because the goals of HBOT for wound healing include cellular proliferation and angiogenesis, HBOT is generally performed daily for a minimum of 30 treatments. Treatment is generally at 2 to 2.4 ATA for a total of 90 minutes of 100% oxygen breathing time."}, {"url": "http://www.hbot.com/faq", "passage_text": "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a medical treatment which enhances the body's natural healing process by inhalation of 100% oxygen in a total body chamber, where atmospheric pressure is increased and controlled.

This increased level of accessible oxygen provides numerous benefits, making HBOT an exceptionally effective treatment for a wide range of health conditions. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment also curbs infection by providing a hostile environment to anaerobic bacteria, which thrive in the absence of oxygen. It promotes the growth of new capillaries and blood vessels to areas with poor circulation and boosts collagen formation for faster wound healing."}, {"url": "https://www.beaumont.edu/centers-services/hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy/what-is-hyperbaric-medicine/", "passage_text": "The hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber at Beaumont Hospital is a multi-place facility, of which there over 175 in use in the USA.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized room or tube. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a well-established treatment for decompression sickness, a hazard of scuba diving. Other conditions treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy include serious infections, bubbles of air in your blood vessels, and wounds that won't heal as a result of diabetes or radiation injury. In a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber, the air pressure is increased to three times higher than normal air pressure. Under these conditions, your lungs can gather more oxygen than would be possible breathing pure oxygen at normal air pressure. Your blood carries this oxygen throughout your body.

An increase in blood oxygen temporarily restores normal levels of blood gases and tissue function to promote healing and fight infection. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used to treat several medical conditions. And medical institutions use it in different ways. Your doctor may suggest hyperbaric oxygen therapy if you have one of the following conditions: 1  Anemia, severe. 2  Brain abscess. 3  Bubbles of air in your blood vessels (arterial gas embolism). 4  Burn."}]
