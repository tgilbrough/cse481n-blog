The postsynaptic density (PSD) is a structure composed of both membranous and cytoplasmic proteins localized at the postsynaptic plasma membrane of excitatory synapses. Biochemical and molecular biological studies have identified a number of proteins present in the PSD. The interneuronal chemical synapse consists of a presynaptic element and an apposed postsynaptic element with an intervening synaptic cleft width of 10\u201320 nm. Both the presynaptic and the postsynaptic membranes display densities on the cytoplasmic faces (Palay, 1958)."}, {"url": "http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Postsynaptic_density", "passage_text": "Composition Edit.
