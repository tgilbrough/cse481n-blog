Galvanizing involves coating corrosive metals, such as steel and iron, with a non-corrosive metal.

The resulting coated steel can be used in much the same way as uncoated. A typical hot-dip galvanizing line operates as follows: 1  Steel is cleaned using a caustic solution. 2  The caustic cleaning solution is rinsed off. 3  The steel is pickled in an acidic solution to remove mill scale. 4  The pickling solution is rinsed off. 5  A flux, often zinc ammonium chloride is applied to the steel to inhibit oxidation of the cleaned 6  ...

Hot-dip galvanizing (HDG) , as referenced on this site, is the process of dipping fabricated steel into a kettle or vat containing molten zinc.

When the dried steel part is immersed in the galvanizing bath the steel surface is wetted by the molten zinc and reacts to form a series of zinc-iron alloy layers. The work remains in the bath until its temperature reaches that of the molten zinc, so that all the galvanizing reactions can go to completion. In simplistic terms, while there is zinc on the surface the steel will be protected from corrosion. Hot dip galvanizing is one of a number of methods available to the surface finisher for applying a zinc coating to an item. Other techniques include electroplating, mechanical plating, and sherardising, painting with zinc-rich coatings and zinc spraying or metallising"}]
