How long can you go without water? Assuming you're in reasonable shape and in ideal conditions -- that is, not in the heat or cold and not exerting, a human can probably live for about 3 to 5 days without any water. Healthier humans can live another day or so longer. This isn't something you should test."}, {"url": "http://www.thewaterpage.com/live-without-water.htm", "passage_text": "A person can survive only three to five days without water, in some cases people have survived for an average of one week.

The human body needs food and water to survive. A human can go for more than three weeks without food (Mahatma Gandhi survived 21 days of complete starvation), but water is a different story. At least 60% of the adult body is made of it and every living cell in the body needs it to keep functioning. Three to four days would be more typical. You can go 100 hours without drinking at an average temperature outdoors, Claude Piantadosi of Duke University told Fox.

In a harsh environment \u2014 it's snowing, say \u2014 you have 3 hours to survive without shelter. After 3 days, you need water or you'll perish. You can make it 3 weeks without food, though we promise you that won't be fun. Despite this possibly helpful rule, some people have survived 8 to 10 days without water. Again, leave such shenanigans to the truly desperate."}]
