Magnets only attract certain types of metals, other materials such as glass, plastic and wood aren't attracted. Metals such as iron, nickel and cobalt are attracted to magnets. Most metals however are not attracted to magnets, these include copper, silver, gold, magnesium, platinum, aluminium and more.

Magnets have north poles and south poles. These attract each other. But two north poles will repel each other, as will two south poles. Iron is magnetic, so any metal with iron in it will be attracted to a magnet.
