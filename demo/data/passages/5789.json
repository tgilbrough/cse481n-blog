Arsenic occurs in many minerals, usually in conjunction with sulfur and metals, and also as a pure elemental crystal. Arsenic is a metalloid. It can exist in various allotropes, although only the gray form has important use in industry. The three most common arsenic allotropes are metallic gray, yellow, and black arsenic, with gray being the most common. Gray arsenic (\u03b1-As, space group R 3 m No. 166) adopts a double-layered structure consisting of many interlocked, ruffled, six-membered rings."}, {"url": "http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm319827.htm", "passage_text": "Arsenic is a chemical element distributed in the Earth\u2019s crust.

Due to natural geological contamination, high levels of arsenic can be found in drinking water that has come from deep drilled wells. 2.3 Arsenic occurs in different forms and some is transported between different parts of the environment where it may change its form.
