This information is relayed in real time to produce images on a computer screen. Many people who hear the term  ultrasound  likely picture a pregnant woman in her doctor's office getting a sneak peek of the baby growing inside her womb -- perhaps even finding out whether she should paint the nursery pink or blue."}, {"url": "http://science.howstuffworks.com/ultrasound1.htm", "passage_text": "In ultrasound, the following events happen: 1  The ultrasound machine transmits high-frequency (1 to 5 megahertz) sound pulses into your body using a probe. 2  The sound waves travel into your body and hit a boundary between tissues (e.g. between fluid and soft tissue, soft tissue and bone). "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound", "passage_text": "Ultrasound s are sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing. Ultrasound is not different from 'normal' (audible) sound in its physical properties, only in that humans cannot hear it. This limit varies from person to person and is approximately 20 kilohertz (20,000 hertz) in healthy, young adults. Ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20 kHz up to several gigahertz"}, {"url": "http://americanpregnancy.org/prenatal-testing/ultrasound/", "passage_text": "Ultrasound: Sonogram.

The images can provide valuable information for diagnosing and treating a variety of diseases and conditions. Most ultrasound examinations are done using a sonar device outside your body, though some ultrasound examinations involve placing a device inside"}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/ultrasound", "passage_text": "An ultrasound scan is a medical test that uses high-frequency sound waves to capture live images from the inside of your body. The technology is similar to that used by sonar and radar, which help the military detect planes and ships. An ultrasound allows your doctor to see problems with organs, vessels, and tissues\u2014without needing to make an incision. Unlike other imaging techniques, ultrasound uses no radiation, so it is the preferred method for viewing a developing fetus during pregnancy."}]
