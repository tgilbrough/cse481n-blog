By superfoods Leave a Comment. D-Ribose is a sugar that has been shown to boost levels of the energy compound ATP. Because D-ribose is a simple sugar, it is extremely well absorbed. Food sources do not supply enough of the recommended amounts of ribose. However, the body generally synthesized enough ribose from glucose to meet its needs.

Ribose is a kind of sugar that is produced by the body. It is used as a medicine. Ribose is used to improve athletic performance and the ability to exercise by boosting muscle energy. It has also been used to improve symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, and coronary artery disease. Ribose is an energy source that the body makes from food. There is some evidence that supplemental ribose might prevent muscle fatigue in people with genetic disorders that prevent sufficient energy production by the body. It might provide extra energy to the heart during exercise in people with heart"}]
