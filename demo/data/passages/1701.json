In the early 1820s, an English mathematician by the name charles Babbage, designed a computing machine called the Difference Engine. This machine was to be used in the calculating and printing of simple math tables. Early Counting Tools. A computer is a machine that works with data and information in the form of numbers. People from the beginning of time, and throughout the years, have invented and continue to invent things that help them count.

I wouldn't call it a computer either, though some people do: it was a machine specifically for breaking the Lorenz machine ciphers, although by 1945 the programming had become more flexible. But the Colossus was crucial in showing Alan Turing the speed and reliability of electronics. But Alan Turing himself never made a point of saying he was first with the idea. And his earnings were always modest. Picture from a Japanese graphic book of Turing's story.

In 1822, Charles Babbage conceptualized and began developing the Difference Engine, considered to be the first automatic computing machine. The Difference Engine was capable of computing several sets of numbers and making hard copies of the results. First programmable computer. The Z1 was created by German Konrad Zuse in his parents' living room between 1936 and 1938. It is considered to be the first electro-mechanical binary programmable computer, and the first really functional modern computer."}]
