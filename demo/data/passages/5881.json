Most oximeters give a reading 2% over or 2% under what your saturation would be if obtained by an arterial blood gas. For example, if your oxygen saturation reads 92% on the pulse oximeter, it may be actually anywhere from 90 to 94%. The oximeter reading may be less accurate if a person is wearing nail polish, artificial nails, has cold hands, or has poor circulation. Beams of light from the device pass through the Pulse oximetry is a way to measure how much oxygen your blood is carrying. By using a small device called a pulse oximeter, your blood oxygen level can be checked without needing to be stuck with a needle."}, {"url": "http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/pulse_oximetry/who_ps_pulse_oxymetry_tutorial1_the_basics_en.pdf", "passage_text": "The Pulse Oximeter In this tutorial you will learn about:\u2022 The function of a pulse oximeter\u2022 How oxygen is transported to the tissues\u2022 How a pulse oximeter can help you in anaesthesia 2. \u00a9 WHO, 2011.

A pulse oximeter is a medical device that indirectly monitors the oxygen saturation of a patient's blood (as opposed to measuring oxygen saturation directly through a blood sample) and changes in blood volume in the skin, producing a photoplethysmogram. Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive method for monitoring a person's O 2 saturation. In its most common (transmissive) application mode, a sensor device is placed on a thin part of the patient's body, usually a fingertip or earlobe, or in the case of an infant, across a foot"}, {"url": "http://www.pulseoximetersplus.com/categories/Pulse-Oximeter-News/What-Does-a-Pulse-Oximeter-Reading-Mean/", "passage_text": "What Does a Pulse Oximeter Reading Mean. Pulse oximeter is a medical device you can use if you want to know the level of saturation of oxygen in your blood. The readings produce by this device are accompanied by the respiratory rate as well as by the percentage of oxygen a person is able to breathe in. If you have history of cardiac and respiratory disease, you would definitely need a pulse oximeter in your home in order for you to be able to monitor your body on a regular basis. The blood circulating the human body is able to carry two forms of oxygen."}, {"url": "http://www.turnermedical.com/Articles.asp?ID=239", "passage_text": "Pulse oximeters are medical devices used to measure the oxygen level (or oxygen saturation) in the blood.

A pulse oximeter uses two frequencies of light (red and infrared) to determine the percentage (%) of hemoglobin in the blood that is saturated with oxygen. The percentage is called blood oxygen saturation, or SpO 2.
