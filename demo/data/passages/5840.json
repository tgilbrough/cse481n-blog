A substrate in chemistry is a particular example of a reactant. Reactants go through chemical changes to yield products. In the case of a substrate, it is a reactant which has the potential to turn into a specific product, but only very slowly. The chemical reaction of a substrate is facilitated by an enzyme."}, {"url": "http://www.chemistryexplained.com/St-Te/Substrate.html", "passage_text": "A substrate is the substance upon which an enzyme acts in an enzymatic reaction. Enzymes are biological catalysts that increase the rate of chemical reactions by decreasing the activation energy required for that reaction."}, {"url": "http://www.chemicool.com/definition/substrate.html", "passage_text": "Definition of substrate.

Enzymes catalyze chemical reactions involving the substrate(s).

In synthetic and organic chemistry, the substrate is the chemical of interest that is being modified. In biochemistry, an enzyme substrate is the material upon which an enzyme acts. When referring to Le Chatelier's Principle, the substrate is the reagent whose concentration is changed."}]
