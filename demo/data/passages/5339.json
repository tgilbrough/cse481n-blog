Dividing the total variable costs for a given time period by that period's production volume will yield the unit variable cost. "}, {"url": "http://amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&c=dsp&k=total+variable+cost", "passage_text": "A cost measure directly related to total variable cost is average variable cost. Total variable cost is the opportunity cost incurred in the short-run production that depends on the quantity of output. As the name clearly implies, total variable cost is variable, it changes. The center column is the total variable cost of producing each quantity, which is exactly $0 if no Stuffed Amigos are produced and rises to $43 if 10 Stuffed Amigos are produced. This is the essence of variable cost. Greater production entails greater total"}, {"url": "http://www.accountingtools.com/questions-and-answers/total-cost-formula.html", "passage_text": "The total cost formula is used to derive the combined variable and fixed costs of a batch of goods or services. The formula is the average fixed cost per unit plus the average variable cost per unit, multiplied by the number of units. The calculation is: (Average fixed cost + Average variable cost) x Number of units = Total cost. For example, a company is incurring $10,000 of fixed costs to produce 1,000 units (for an average fixed cost per unit of $10), and its variable cost per unit is $3. At the 1,000-unit production level, the total cost of the production is: ($10 Average fixed cost + $3 Average variable cost) x 1,000 Units = $13,000 Total cost. There are several problems with the total cost formula, which are as follows:"}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071116064747AAVUdn0", "passage_text": "Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: variable cost = Total Cost-fixed cost $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00 As output is 1 unit, average variable cost = $5.00 ($5.00 / 1) So, the formula is: variable cost = $5.00 * output.

Thumbs up."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/variable-cost-definition-formula-examples.html", "passage_text": "By dividing the total variable costs for a specific period by that same period's production volume will provide us with the variable cost per spark plug. For example, if the spark plug business made 500,000 units last year, its unit variable cost is $90,000 / 500,000, or $0.18. Formula of Variable Cost. The formula to calculate variable cost is: Total Variable Cost = Total Quantity of Output * Variable Cost Per Unit of Output. To recognize variable costs, it is important to understand how to categorize costs. Variable costs are those which do not remain constant, specifically when production activities fluctuate"}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/total-cost-in-economics-definition-formula.html", "passage_text": "Formula. TC (total cost) = TFC (total fixed cost) + TVC (total variable cost). Now that you know the formula and things to consider, let's go back to that question in the beginning of how much it costs to operate your car every month. In economics, total cost is made up of variable costs + fixed costs. Variable costs (VC) are costs that change based on how many goods you produce or how much of a service you use. Fixed costs (FC) are costs that don't change from month to month and don't vary based on activities or the number of goods used."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost", "passage_text": "If one assumes that the unit variable cost is constant, as in cost-volume-profit analysis developed and used in cost accounting by the accountants, then total cost is linear in volume, and given by: total cost = fixed costs + unit variable cost * amount. One can decompose total costs as the sum of fixed costs and variable costs. In the Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis model, total costs are linear in volume. The total cost curve, if non-linear, can represent increasing and diminishing marginal returns."}]
