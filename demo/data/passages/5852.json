The set-up for fluorescence detection in a capillary electrophoresis system can be complicated. The method requires that the light beam be focused on the capillary, which can be difficult for many light sources. Laser-induced fluorescence has been used in CE systems with detection limits as low as 10 \u221218 to 10 \u221221 mol."}, {"url": "http://chemistry.tutorvista.com/environmental-chemistry/capillary-electrophoresis.html", "passage_text": "Capillary Electrophoresis System. 1  The DNA fragments are separated by size. 2  The agarose gel is used for separation of large DNA molecule and the polyacrylamide gel is used for the small DNA fragments. 3  The gel is dipped in the buffer solution.

There two main techniques by which electrophoresis is achieved today: gel and capillary electrophoresis, both of which are based on the same principle of size and charge based fragment separation. Capillaries are made of fused silica and have an internal diameter of only 50-100\u03bcm and can be 25-100cm in length. Similarly to gel electrophoresis, size separation is achieved via use of buffer solutions and application of positive and negative charges at either end of the capillary."}, {"url": "http://chemistry.tutorvista.com/environmental-chemistry/capillary-electrophoresis.html", "passage_text": "Capillary Electrophoresis.

Capillary electrophoresis (CE), also known as capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), can be used to separate ionic species by their charge and frictional forces. In traditional electrophoresis, electrically charged analytes move in a conductive liquid medium under the influence of an electric field. With DNA capillary electrophoresis, DNA strands are made through DNA replication with dNTPs that are fluorescently labeled for the different nucleotides. Each base is labeled a different color. A fine laser lights up the DNA strand in the capillary tube and reads what color fluoresces."}, {"url": "http://chemistry.tutorvista.com/environmental-chemistry/capillary-electrophoresis.html", "passage_text": "The capillary electrophoresis is good and widely used due to the following advantage.It is a high resolution non chromatography separation technique.It has low operating cost and small amount of sample is required.
