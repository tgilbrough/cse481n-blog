Yaw originated in the aviation industry as yaw, pitch and roll must be controlled for the successful flight of an aircraft but the yaw rate is now an essential part of automotive safety.he yaw rate is something that is continuously measured by the yaw sensors and compared with the tire angle but the system only acts when the necessary action is required."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaw_%28rotation%29", "passage_text": "A yaw rotation is a movement around the yaw axis of a rigid body that changes the direction it is pointing, to the left or right of its direction of motion."}, {"url": "http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/yaw.html", "passage_text": "We can then define the orientation of the aircraft by the amount of rotation of the parts of the aircraft along these principal axes. The yaw axis is perpendicular to the wings and lies in the plane of the aircraft centerline. A yaw motion is a side to side movement of the nose of the aircraft as shown in the animation. The yawing motion is being caused by the deflection of the rudder of this aircraft. The rudder is a hinged section at the rear of the vertical stabilizer. As described on the shape effects slide, changing the angle of deflection at the rear of an airfoil changes the amount of lift generated by the foil."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics", "passage_text": "Roll, pitch and yaw refer, in this context, to rotations about the respective axes starting from a defined equilibrium state. The equilibrium roll angle is known as wings level or zero bank angle, equivalent to a level heeling angle on a ship. Yaw is known as heading.he three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three dimensions about the vehicle's center of mass, known as roll, pitch and yaw (quite different from their use as Tait-Bryan angles). Aircraft engineers develop control systems for a vehicle's orientation (attitude) about its center of mass."}]
