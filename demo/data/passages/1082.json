[{"url": "http://www.turkeyandturkeyhunting.com/turkey-scratchings/brian-lovett-blog/turkeys-365-all-about-turkey-beards", "passage_text": "The beard is a collection of filaments, or bristles, protruding from the breast of a male turkey, just below his chest. It begins growing when a bird is about 5 months old and continues to grow throughout his life, typically 4 or 5 inches per year. Spring jakes usually have 3- to 4-inch beards, though some early-hatched birds sport 5-inch beards. When a gobbler reaches 2, his beard is usually 8 to 10 inches. A beard gets its black color from melanin, a pigment that colors and strengthens feathers. Therefore, most 3-year-old and older gobblers have \u201conly\u201d 9- to 10-inch beards. Further, their tips will be mostly black because the original amber filaments have broken off. Some hens \u2014 maybe one in 20, depending on the location \u2014 also grow beards. Typically, hen beards are thin and measure 6 to 8 inches."}, {"url": "http://guidedturkeyhunting.com/turkey-info/turkey-beard-anyway/", "passage_text": "Published January 18, 2013 | By Larry Stephens. The beard of a turkey is a curious oddity. Actually, it is not a beard or hair at all. It is a modified feather that forms kind of a stiff bristle. Since the cluster of bristles resembles a beard of sorts, people began referring to it as a beard. By the next spring he will be a 2 year old and sport a beard up to 9-10\u2033.

RE: how fast does a turkey' s beard grow? Maytom is right about the spurs tellin the age. a jake will have 1/2 or less spur length. a 2 year ole tom will have spurs up to one inch long. spurs longer than an inch, will be at least a 3 year old turkey. my personal belief is a tom with 1 1/8 spurs is a 3 year old. RE: how fast does a turkey' s beard grow? Totoe and Don are right on about the beards. Spurs are a better  age teller, but when they hit the 1 mark and a little beyond, it' s a toss up about the bird being a 3-4-5 year old!! Depending on which state you hunt, some spur length' s grow longer per age group."}, {"url": "https://www.biggamelogic.com/ArticlesNews/tabid/136/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/437/Scoring-A-Wild-Turkey.aspx", "passage_text": "That scores this gobbler at 65.25.
