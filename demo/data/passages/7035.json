In normal cells, the binding of epidermal growth factor to its receptor on the cell surface is an important signal that promotes cell proliferation. Receptors recognize and bind to other substances, and the binding typically has a specific effect on the cells. EGFR is one of a group of receptors called receptor tyrosine kinases that help regulate cell growth, division, survival, and death. This regulation is a very complex process involving the activation of a series of signals along various pathways"}, {"url": "https://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA162356267", "passage_text": "EGFR is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a central role in regulating cell division and death.

It functions as an on or off switch in many cellular functions. Tyrosine kinases are a subclass of protein kinase. The phosphate group is attached to the amino acid tyrosine on the protein. Tyrosine kinases are a subgroup of the larger class of protein kinases that attach phosphate groups to other amino acids (serine and threonine).
