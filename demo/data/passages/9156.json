There are three types of filaments in the cytoplasm of most vertebrate cells: microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. Microfilaments. The microfilament system is a network of filaments 6 nanometers (nm) in diameter that are important for anchoring plasma membrane proteins, for producing cell movement, and for cell division."}, {"url": "http://www.sparknotes.com/biology/cellstructure/intracellularcomponents/section1.html", "passage_text": "In this section we will discuss the intracellular components that are not organelles.

It forms a framework for the movement of organelles around the cytoplasm-most of the organelles are attached to the cytoskeleton. The network consists of protein microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. The cytoskeleton provides an important structural framework for: 1  Cell shape. 2  For cells without cell walls, the cytoskeleton determines the shape of the cell. 3  This is one of the functions of the intermediate filaments. 4  Cell movement."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Where_is_the_Cytoskeleton_located", "passage_text": "The cytoskeleton is the scaffolding of a cell.

These structures give the cell its shape and help organize the cell's parts. In addition, they provide a basis for movement and cell division. In many types of cells, networks of actin filaments are found beneath the cell cortex, which is the meshwork of membrane-associated proteins that supports and strengthens the plasma membrane.
