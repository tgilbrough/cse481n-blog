In our acid-base titration lab, we used phenolphthalein to monitor the neutralization reactions. What are the chemical differences between an equivalence point and an endpoint in titration and use this to explain whether phenolphthalein could be used as an indicator in any acid/base neutralization.

This is a delicate procedure that requires patience and a good observation skills. Usually, an indicator is used in titration to determine the endpoint of the reaction.

This procedure is commonly used in the field of analytical chemistry"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endpoint_(chemistry)", "passage_text": "(July 2013). The equivalence point, or stoichiometric point, of a chemical reaction is the point at which chemically equivalent quantities of acid and base have been mixed. In other words, the moles of acid are equivalent to the moles of base. It can be found by means of an indicator, most often phenolphthalein. Redox indicators are also frequently used. A drop of indicator solution is added to the titration at the start; when the color changes the endpoint has been reached, this is an approximation of the equivalence point."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endpoint_(chemistry)", "passage_text": "An acid-base indicator (e.g., phenolphthalein) changes color depending on the pH.

Titration with a pH meter follows the same procedure as a titration with an indicator, except that the endpoint is detected by a rapid change in pH, rather than the color change of an indicator.

For this application, it turns colorless in acidic solutions and pink in basic solutions. Phenolphthalein is slightly soluble in water and usually is dissolved in alcohols for use in experiments. It is a weak acid, which can lose H + ions in solution. The phenolphthalein molecule is colorless, and the phenolphthalein ion is pink. When a base is added to the phenolphthalein, the molecule \u21cc ions equilibrium shifts to the right, leading to more ionization as H + ions are removed.
