The procedure is either by classic arthrotomy or arthroscopy. Arthroscopic synovectomy has many advantages over open synovectomy: including minimal invasive surgery, short hospital stay, diminution of postoperative joint stiffness, and better complete synovectomy. In an arthroscopic procedure, the excision can be restricted to the areas of involvement in the localized form. When total synovectomy is indicated, an experienced arthroscopist can more adequately perform a total synovectomy than an open A"}, {"url": "http://www.medicalport.org/medical-procedures-medical-tourism-portugal/orthopedics/knee-arthrotomy-and-arthroscopy.aspx", "passage_text": "Arthroscopy is a surgical procedure by which the internal structure of a joint is examined for diagnosis and/or treatment using a tube-like viewing instrument called an arthroscope.

For knee arthroscopy only two small incisions are made, one for the arthroscope and one for the surgical instruments to be used in the knee cavity."}]
