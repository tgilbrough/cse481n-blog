Carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, travels from the blood to the alveoli, where it can be exhaled. Between the alveoli is a thin layer of cells called the interstitium, which contains blood vessels and cells that help support the alveoli.

The process of inhalation must inflate the alveoli, but it can only do so because of the presence of a surfactant fluid that coats the alveoli and lowers the surface tension of their walls."}, {"url": "http://www.macmillan.org.uk/information-and-support/lung-cancer/understanding-cancer/the-lungs.html", "passage_text": "They divide to form smaller tubes called bronchioles, which carry air through the lungs.

In the alveoli, oxygen is absorbed from the air we breathe in and passes into the bloodstream to be circulated around the body.
