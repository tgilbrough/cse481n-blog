Conversely, the cost of malpractice insurance for a dentist is static no matter the number of customers seen but can increase on an annual basis. Dental practices that see more patients and offer a wider variety of services spend more on the materials to accomplish this extra work. On average, dental supply expenses take up approximately 5 percent of the practice's revenue according to Dental Economics."}, {"url": "http://www.dentaleconomics.com/articles/print/volume-96/issue-9/features/the-real-cost-of-dentistry.html", "passage_text": "We will begin our cost analysis with a simple and basic dental procedure-a Class I occlusal composite filling (code D2391).

Additionally, we will calculate the average cost to keep the dental office open per hour based upon a national average of rural and urban areas. In other words, if a dental office can net $312 an hour after all expenses, that office should fall into the $525,000 average yearly revenue bracket.

Price is the easier of the two concepts. Price, as with any commodity, is determined by the marketplace. Currently the national average for the price of a dental practice is approximately 65% of the past year's gross receipts.

Taking into account practice overhead, it will take monthly collections of $21,200, $16,000, or $14,000 respectively to cover the debt service. We should also look at controlling our supply expenses and bank fees.
