[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic", "passage_text": "A ceramic is an inorganic, nonmetallic solid material comprising metal, nonmetal or metalloid atoms primarily held in ionic and covalent bonds. The crystallinity of ceramic materials ranges from highly oriented to semi-crystalline, and often completely amorphous (e.g., glasses). A ceramic material is an inorganic, non-metallic, often crystalline oxide, nitride or carbide material. Some elements, such as carbon or silicon, may be considered ceramics. Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, weak in shearing and tension."}, {"url": "http://www.overstock.com/guides/porcelain-tiles-vs-ceramic-tiles", "passage_text": "Ceramic tile is made from natural clay, sand and water. These materials are molded to form square or rectangular tiles and then baked in a kiln to remove most of the moisture. Porcelain tile is also made from clay but tends to be made using denser types of clay than ceramic. Ceramic is likely to chip or crack if objects are dropped on it, and the tiles are not expected to hold up for as long as porcelain units. Ceramic should not be used in most commercial applications, while porcelain can be used in light-or medium-duty commercial projects in addition to residential. 1  Installation."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic_art", "passage_text": "Ceramic art is art made from ceramic materials (including clay), which may take forms including art ware, tile, figurines, sculpture, and tableware. Ceramic art is one of the arts, particularly one of the visual arts, and of those, it is one of the plastic arts. While some ceramics are considered fine art, some are considered to be decorative, industrial or applied art objects. Ceramics may also be considered artifacts in archaeology. There is a long history of ceramic art in almost all developed cultures, and often ceramic objects are all the artistic evidence left from vanished cultures, like that of the Nok in Africa over 2,000 years ago."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic", "passage_text": "The word  ceramic comes from the Greek word \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (keramikos), of pottery or for pottery, from \u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (keramos), potter's clay, tile, pottery.

Ceramics are all around us.

Once the ceramic has been shaped, it is fired in a high temperature oven known as a kiln. Often, ceramics are covered in decorative, waterproof, paint-like substances known as glazes.
