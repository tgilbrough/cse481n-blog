The left hemisphere's functions are analytic thought, logic, language, science and math. The right hemisphere's functions include holistic thought, intuition, creativity, art, and music. The two hemispheres are connected by the corpus callosum. The cerebellum is also divided into left and right hemispheres. The brain can be divided into two hemispheres: the left and right brain.
