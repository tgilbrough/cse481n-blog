Abnormally high amounts of sugar in the urine, known as glycosuria, are usually the result of high blood sugar levels. High blood sugar usually occurs in diabetes, especially when untreated. Normally, when blood is filtered in the kidneys, some sugar remains in the fluid that will later become urine.

This condition can cause urine glucose levels to be high even if the blood glucose levels are normal. When too much glucose is found in the urine, the most common culprit is diabetes.

The test for urine glucose uses a small dipstick that changes color after it has been dipped in urine.

First, the renal threshold \u2014 the blood glucose level at which the kidneys begin to excrete glucose in the urine \u2014 is relatively high.

It's used to monitor both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. If your blood glucose rises above normal, your kidneys get rid of the extra glucose in your urine. That's why a urine glucose test may be able to determine whether your blood glucose is too high. Although easier to perform than a blood test, a urine test for glucose is not as accurate as a blood test. Urine tests are usually used only when blood testing for glucose is difficult or impossible."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosuria", "passage_text": "Glycosuria or glucosuria is the excretion of glucose into the urine. Ordinarily, urine contains no glucose because the kidneys are able to reclaim all of the filtered glucose back into the bloodstream. Glycosuria is nearly always caused by elevated blood glucose levels, most commonly due to untreated diabetes mellitus. Rarely, glycosuria is due to an intrinsic problem with glucose reabsorption within the kidneys themselves, a condition termed renal glycosuria."}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/urine-tests", "passage_text": "While blood glucose testing is the primary way to test for high glucose, urine testing can also be useful: because excess glucose in the body eventually passes through urine, testing urine can provide insight into whether or not there is excess glucose throughout the rest of your body.
