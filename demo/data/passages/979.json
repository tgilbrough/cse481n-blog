The basic working unit of the nervous system is a cell called a neuron. The human brain contains about 100 billion neurons. The nervous system consists of two main parts: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system: 1  The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord."}, {"url": "http://biology.about.com/od/organsystems/ss/central-nervous-system.htm", "passage_text": "The central nervous system (CNS) is the processing center for the nervous system. It receives information from and sends information to the peripheral nervous system. The two main organs of the CNS are the brain and spinal cord. Interneurons relay signals between motor and sensory neurons. The nervous system consists of the brain, spinal cord, and a complex network of neurons. This system is responsible for sending, receiving, and interpreting information from all parts of the body."}, {"url": "http://www.innerbody.com/image/nervov.html", "passage_text": "Nerves. Nerves are bundles of axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) that act as information highways to carry signals between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body. Each axon is wrapped in a connective tissue sheath called the endoneurium. 1 Sensory. 2  The sensory function of the nervous system involves collecting information from sensory receptors that monitor the body\u2019s internal and external conditions. 3  These signals are then passed on to the central nervous system (CNS) for further processing by afferent neurons (and nerves)."}, {"url": "http://www.livescience.com/22665-nervous-system.html", "passage_text": "The nervous system is a complex collection of nerves and specialized cells known as neurons that transmit signals between different parts of the body. It is essentially the body\u2019s electrical wiring. Structurally, the nervous system has two components: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system consists of sensory neurons, ganglia (clusters of neurons) and nerves that connect to one another and to the central nervous system. Functionally, the nervous system has two main subdivisions: the somatic, or voluntary, component; and the autonomic, or involuntary, component."}, {"url": "http://www.innerbody.com/image/nervov.html", "passage_text": "The nervous system consists of the brain, spinal cord, sensory organs, and all of the nerves that connect these organs with the rest of the body.

Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago. At the cellular level, the nervous system is defined by the presence of a special type of cell, called the neuron, also known as a nerve cell. Neurons have special structures that allow them to send signals rapidly and precisely to other cells."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_function_of_the_nervous_system", "passage_text": "In general, the function of the nervous system is to transmit sensory information to the brain for processing and to transmit motor information from the brain for action. The nervous system controls what the organism does; it is in charge. The mind (for those species intelligent enough to have minds) is generated by the nervous system. The nervous system controls our lives and all of our body functions."}, {"url": "https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/neuro/conditioninfo/Pages/parts.aspx", "passage_text": "1 The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord. 2  The peripheral nervous system is made up of the nerve fibers that branch off from the spinal cord and extend to all parts of the body, including the neck and arms, torso, legs, skeletal muscles and internal organs.
