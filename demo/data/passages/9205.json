Epiglottitis is inflammation (swelling) of the epiglottis-a flap located at the base of the tongue which stops food from going down the wrong way into the windpipe (trachea) when we are eating.

It acts as a switch between the larynx and the esophagus to permit air to enter the airway to the lungs and food to pass into the gastrointestinal tract. In its relaxed position, the epiglottis projects into the pharynx, or throat, and rests just posterior to the tongue. Viewed from the posterior direction, it is shaped like a teardrop with a wide, rounded region at the superior end and a narrow tapered point at its inferior end.... Click to read more below."}]
