While Ferrari, Red Bull and other teams are conducting more CFD runs, they are also limited by F1 regulations in the amount of CFD that can be used. F1's governing body dictates the number of teraflops [computing power] a team can run, as well as the hours of wind tunnel testing performed each week."}, {"url": "http://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Introduction_to_CFD", "passage_text": "Fluid dynamics is a field of science which studies the physical laws governing the flow of fluids under various conditions. Great effort has gone into understanding the governing laws and the nature of fluids themselves, resulting in a complex yet theoretically strong field of research. CFD has enabled us to understand the world in new ways. We can now see what it is like to be in a furnace, model how blood flows through our arteries and veins and even create virtual worlds."}, {"url": "http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/computational-fluid-dynamics-CFD", "passage_text": "Part of the Mathematics glossary: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is the use of applied mathematics, physics and computational software to visualize how a gas or liquid flows -- as well as how the gas or liquid affects objects as it flows past. Computational fluid dynamics is based on the Navier-Stokes equations. These equations describe how the velocity, pressure, temperature, and density of a moving fluid are related."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics", "passage_text": "Computational fluid dynamics, usually abbreviated as CFD, is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and algorithms to solve and analyze problems that involve fluid flows.
