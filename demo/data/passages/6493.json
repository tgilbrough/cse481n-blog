The humanistic approach sought to glimpse the whole person, not just fragmented parts of the personality or isolated cognitions.

Mental chronometry is studied using the measurements of reaction time (RT). Reaction time is the elapsed time between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the subsequent behavioral response. In psychometric psychology it is considered to be an index of speed of processing. That is, it indicates how fast the thinker can execute the mental operations needed by the task at hand. In turn, speed of processing is considered an index of processing efficiency"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "passage_text": "Psychology is the study of mind and behavior.
