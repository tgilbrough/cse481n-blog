The beans develop only on mature plants that have obtained 10 feet or more in height. It takes about five months for the beans to ripen. Vanilla bean plants grow best when the air temperatures are between 80 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit, which means they need a heated greenhouse in most climates. They require bright shade and high humidity, which equals daily misting, but not wet soil."}, {"url": "http://homeguides.sfgate.com/vanilla-bean-plant-58942.html", "passage_text": "The vanilla bean plant (Vanilla planifolia) belongs to the Orchidaceae or orchid family.

When a slave discovered that the vanilla bean plant could be pollinated by hand, cultivation of vanilla spread all over the world. Many green thumbs attempt to grow the vanilla bean in their homes, but it can be a difficult and lengthy process. Hand-pollination and humidity are the keys to growing a vanilla bean plant. Step 6. Re-pot your vanilla bean plant as it grows. Transplant it to a larger pot about once each year so that the plant doesn't become pot-bound. It can take up to five years for a vine to mature and bear vanilla beans."}]
