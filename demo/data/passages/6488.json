I like the principle level, (if you have more than one), to be at exactly the same height as the matress of the bed. I think a lot of people make it too low, or worse, too high. Shorter nightstands, such as a low profile modern style that is only 18\u201d TO 20\u201d off the floor, call for a taller lamp to equal the visual proportion if the headboard is higher than 36\u201d above the nightstand top.

The average bed is around the same height. If you have a higher bed that needs a stepping stool, or a lower, minimalist type bed, you should adjust the night table height accordingly.

The height of the ideal bedside lamp for your room depends upon the nightstand or table upon which the lamp sits. If the nightstand is tall, such as 25 to 30 inches, the lamp should be in the 30-inch range in order to look proportional against a headboard or the room in general.

For the past ten years, we've had very low bedside tables. Whether it's a low cut side table or a vintage trunk, I've tended to go low slung. This past weekend, however, we rearranged and moved our IKEA Anes dressers next to our bed to shake things up a bit. I would start with 27 for the side table or nightstand (near table height) and then adjust your bed lower from there. Ours is about 4-5 from mattress to side table, which is perfect for us right now."}, {"url": "http://ths.gardenweb.com/discussions/2448244/height-of-nightstand-in-relation-to-mattress", "passage_text": "Sonicmom, you should do some mock-ups of different height nightstands with cardboard boxes or stacks of books or something.
