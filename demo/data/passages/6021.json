Good decision-making processes, and therefore good governance, share several characteristics. Good governance is equitable and inclusive.

This means that all groups, particularly the most vulnerable, should have opportunities to participate in the process."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_governance", "passage_text": "Good governance is an indeterminate term used in international development literature to describe how public institutions conduct public affairs and manage public resources. Governance is the process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented (or not implemented). The term governance can apply to corporate, international, national, local governance or to the interactions between other sectors of society. The concept of good governance often emerges as a model to compare ineffective economies or political bodies with viable economies and political bodies. Again, to refer to President Obama\u2019s speech, what Africa needs is not more strong men, it needs more strong democratic institutions that will stand the test of time. (Applause.) Without good governance, no amount of oil or no amount of aid, no amount of effort can guarantee Nigeria\u2019s success."}]
