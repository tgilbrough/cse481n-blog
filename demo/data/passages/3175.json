Actually the synapse occurs between the \u201csynaptic end bulbs\u201d of the motor neuron and \u201cmotor end plate \u201d of muscle fiber. The motor end plate is in fact the highly excitable region of muscle fiber plasma membrane and it is responsible for initiating action potentials across the muscle surface. Synaptic cleft is the space between the motor end plate (muscle fiber part) and synaptic end bulb (motor neuron part) of the neuromuscular junction. It is 20 to 30 nanometers wide. Because of this cleft, the connection between the motor neuron and the muscle fiber is not continuous and there is a break"}, {"url": "http://www.ivyroses.com/HumanBody/Muscles/Muscle_Anatomy-Neuromuscular-Junction.php", "passage_text": "Each neuromuscular junction consists of the axon terminal of a motor neuron and the motor end plate of a muscle fibre. : 1  The long processes of neurones are called axons. : 2  The part of the sarcolemma of the muscle cell that is in closest proximity to the synaptic end bulb is called the  motor end plate .

The somatic neuromuscular junction is the site of communication between motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibres. Specialisations of the neuromuscular junction mean that activity in and release of transmitter from motor neurons produces contraction of skeletal muscle fibres rapidly and reliably."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction", "passage_text": "In vertebrates, motor neurons release acetylcholine (ACh), a small molecule neurotransmitter, which diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the cell membrane of the muscle fiber, also known as the sarcolemma. It is at the neuromuscular junction that a motor neuron is able to transmit a signal to the muscle fiber, causing muscle contraction."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/The_junction_between_a_motor_neurons_axon_and_the_muscle_cell_membrane_is_called_a_neuromuscular_junction_or_a", "passage_text": "The junction between a motor neruon's axon and the muscle cell membrane is called a neuromuscular junction or a myoneural junction?
