It is essentially the body\u2019s electrical wiring. Structurally, the nervous system has two components: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system consists of sensory neurons, ganglia (clusters of neurons) and nerves that connect to one another and to the central nervous system.

However, the central nervous system is composed of the brain and spinal cord. The first is the central nervous system, which includes the brain and the spinal cord.

The part of the PNS that is under voluntary control is called the somatic nervous system. Ad. Certain functions of the peripheral nervous system are automatic.

The nervous system monitors and coordinates internal organ function and responds to changes in the external environment. Motor nervous system cells carry information from the CNS to organs, muscles, and glands. The motor nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.
