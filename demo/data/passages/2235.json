Essential means that it is not produced by the body and therefore it must be taken in either by diet or by taking supplements.

It is an essential amino acid for humans. Lysine's codons are AAA and AAG. Lysine is a base, as are arginine and histidine. The \u03b5-amino group often participates in hydrogen bonding and as a general base in catalysis.
