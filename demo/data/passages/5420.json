Macronutrients are nutrients that provide calories or energy. The prefix makro is from the Greek and means big or large, used because macronutrients are required in large amounts. There are three broad classes of macro-nutrients: proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Carbohydrates are roughly 50% oxygen, and like fats, they usually have less than 5% nitrogen or none at all. Proteins, on the other hand, consist of 15-25% nitrogen and about an equal amount of oxygen. The three macronutrients are often found together in most foods, but in varying amounts, or alone in other foods."}, {"url": "http://www.innerbody.com/nutrition/macronutrients", "passage_text": "Like carbohydrates and lipids, proteins are one of the macronutrients. Though protein provides your body with 4 kcals per gram, giving you energy is not its primary role. Rather, it\u2019s got way too many other things going on. In fact, your body contains thousands of different proteins, each with a unique function. A complete protein includes all of the essential amino acids. Complete proteins include all animal proteins and soy. Incomplete proteins lack one or more essential amino acids. Beans, nuts, grains and vegetables are incomplete proteins."}, {"url": "http://paleoleap.com/micronutrients-nourishing-diet/", "passage_text": "This framework consists of two types of nutrients: macronutrients (protein, fat, and carbohydrates), which supply energy in the form of calories, and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), which support the various biochemical processes in your body. Keeping track of macronutrients is fairly simple \u2013 there are only three, and most people have a rough idea of what kinds of foods supply which ones. But tracking every single micronutrient in your diet to make sure you meet your RDA would be impossibly tedious.
