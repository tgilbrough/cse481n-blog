Autosomes appear in pairs whose members have the same form but differ from other pairs in a diploid cell, whereas members of an allosome pair may differ from one another and thereby determine sex. There are two copies of each autosome (chromosomes 1-22) in both females and males. The sex chromosomes are different: There are two copies of the X-chromosome in females, but males have a single X-chromosome and a Y-chromosome."}, {"url": "http://www.mayoclinic.org/autosomal-dominant-inheritance-pattern/IMG-20006210", "passage_text": "Print.

Autosomal dominant is one of several ways that a trait or disorder can be passed down (inherited) through families. In an autosomal dominant disease, if you inherit the abnormal gene from only one parent, you can get the disease. Often, one of the parents may also have the disease. It also depends on whether the trait is dominant or recessive.

There is one pair of sex chromosomes and 22 pairs of autosomes. A gene is the part of a chromosome that codes for a particular function. There can be thousands of genes on a chromosome.
