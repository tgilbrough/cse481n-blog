Only the 'visible' wavelengths can. 1  Comments (0). 2  Report.

The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light. A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 390 to 700 nm. In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 430\u2013770 THz."}, {"url": "http://www.energeticsynthesis.com/index.php/library/science-of-ascension/2211-visible-light-spectrum", "passage_text": "Details.

Electromagnetic energy travels in waves and spans a broad spectrum from very long radio waves to very short gamma rays. The human eye can only detect only a small portion of this spectrum called visible light. A radio detects a different portion of the spectrum, and an x-ray machine uses yet another portion. "}, {"url": "http://cmb.physics.wisc.edu/pub/tutorial/spectrum.html", "passage_text": "The electromagnetic spectrum is a map of all the types of light that we can identify. It separates all the types of light by wavelength because that directly relates to how energetic the wave is. More energetic waves have shorter wavelengths while less energetic waves have longer wavelengths. Not all light is in the visible spectrum, which is the light you can see. There are many kinds of electromagnetic waves that you can't see. Just look at the spectrum below. When we talk about a light detector, we are referring to any instrument that detects electromagnetic radiation."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Which_portion_of_the_electromagnetic_spectrum_can_human_eyes_detect", "passage_text": "Share to: It is our eyes that are capable of detecting a portion of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum called visible light, or the optical spectrum.
