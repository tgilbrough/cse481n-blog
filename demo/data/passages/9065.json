Cytoplasm-The cytoplasm, or protoplasm, of bacterial cells is where the functions for cell growth, metabolism, and replication are carried out. It is a gel-like matrix composed of water, enzymes, nutrients, wastes, and gases and contains cell structures such as ribosomes, a chromosome, and plasmids. Unlike the eukaryotic (true) cells, bacteria do not have a membrane enclosed nucleus. The chromosome, a single, continuous strand of DNA, is localized, but not contained, in a region of the cell called the nucleoid. All the other cellular components are scattered throughout the cytoplasm."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_structure_that_surrounds_the_cytoplasm_in_a_bacterial_cell", "passage_text": "The cell membrane (also called the plasma membrane, plasmalemma, or phospholipid bilayer) surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell and, in animal cells, physically separates \u2026 the intracellular components from the extracellular environment, thereby serving a function similar to that of skin.
