Merge this question into. Split and merge into it. Answer by Tinytot28. Confidence votes 56. grass is vascular. it has specialized vascular tissues that transport water (xylem) and nutrients and minerals (phloem). this is a vascular plant because it can reproduce plants!

Most plants have a vascular design. Vascular plants are those which have tubes called xylem or phloem inside of them for the transport of liquid. Plants which have roots, stems and leaves are vascular. Nonvascular plants do not have tubes inside and must move water through them in a different manner. Examples of vascular plants would be trees, vegetable plants, grass and anything with flowers. Nonvascular plants include mosses, liverworts and hornworts. Very few kinds of vascular plants are seedless. Instead they produce spores for the purpose of regeneration. Nonvascular plants do not produce fruit or generate seeds. They also produce spores for reproduction, which is a complicated process."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Is_grass_a_vascular_plant", "passage_text": "Grass is a vascular plant because it has vascular tissue that carries food, water, and nutrients, it has a true root system, and it's made of long, tube-like cells.

In plants, a vascular system is analogous to the heart, veins and arteries of an animal (which is why it's called a cardiovascular system). It is a system of tubes that transports water and nutrients throughout the plant. Phloem tissue carries sugar from the leaves to other cells of the plants.
