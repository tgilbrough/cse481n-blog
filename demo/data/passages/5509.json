A CSF leak is a condition that occurs when the CSF leaks through a defect in the dura or the skull and out through the nose or ear. A CSF leak results from a hole or tear in the dura, the outermost layer of the meninges. Causes of the hole or tear can include head injury and brain or sinus surgery. CSF leaks may also occur after lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap or spinal anesthesia. Spontaneous CSF leaks can also occur for no known reason"}, {"url": "https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/csf/tab/test", "passage_text": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may be used to help diagnose a wide variety of diseases and conditions affecting the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).
