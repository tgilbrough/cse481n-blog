Short-acting anticholinergic medications work in about 15 minutes and last for 6-8 hours. Some providers do not consider these drugs as reliever medication because they take longer to work than beta-agonist drugs. While the beta-agonists affect the bronchioles (small airways), anticholinergics affect the muscles around the bronchi (large airways). When the lungs are irritated, these bands of muscle can tighten, making the bronchi narrower."}, {"url": "http://memory.ucsf.edu/ftd/medical/treatment/avoid/multiple", "passage_text": "Anticholinergics decrease acetylcholine activity to balance out the production of dopamine and acetylcholine.
