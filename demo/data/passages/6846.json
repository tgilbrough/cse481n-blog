Primary Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK) are available from single or from pooled donors isolated from the epidermis of juvenile foreskin or adult skin from different locations like the face, the breasts, the abdomen, and the thighs."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte", "passage_text": "A keratinocyte is the predominant cell type in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, constituting 90% of the cells found there. Those keratinocytes found in the basal layer (stratum basale) of the skin are sometimes referred to as basal cells or basal keratinocytes. Since keratinocyte differentiation inhibits keratinocyte proliferation, factors that promote keratinocyte proliferation should be considered as preventing differentiation.

Keratinocytes form tight junctions with the nerves of the skin and hold the Langerhans cells and intra-dermal lymphocytes in position within the epidermis.
