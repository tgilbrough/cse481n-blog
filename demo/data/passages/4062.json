A comprehensive metabolic panel is a blood test that measures your sugar (glucose) level, electrolyte and fluid balance, kidney function, and liver function. Glucose is a type of sugar your body uses for energy. Electrolytes keep your body's fluids in balance. It also controls the amounts of glucose, protein, and fat in the blood and releases substances that keep your immune system healthy. Your doctor may order a comprehensive metabolic panel as part of a regular health examination."}, {"url": "http://www.cancer.org/treatment/understandingyourdiagnosis/examsandtestdescriptions/understanding-your-lab-test-results", "passage_text": "Here are 2 of the most common types of blood tests and what they can tell the doctor about your health: the complete blood count (CBC) and the chemistry panel. Some people find it helps to ask for a copy of their lab results and have a member of their health care team go over the numbers with them. The most common lab test that you\u2019ll have done during treatment is called a complete blood count, or CBC. Blood is made up of water, proteins, nutrients, and living cells. A CBC tells your health care team about the cells in your blood."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_metabolic_panel", "passage_text": "The comprehensive metabolic panel, or chemical screen, (CMP; CPT code 80053) is a panel of 14 blood tests which serves as an initial broad medical screening tool.
