Earthenware may be biscuit (or bisque) fired to temperatures between 1,000 and 1,150 \u00b0C (1,800 and 2,100 \u00b0F) and glost-fired (or glaze-fired) to between 950 to 1,050 \u00b0C (1,740 to 1,920 \u00b0F), the usual practice in factories and some studio potteries. Darker-colored earthenwares, typically orange or red, due to a comparatively high content of iron oxide are widely used for flower pots, tiles and some decorative and oven wares.

The three most common types of clay are earthenware, stoneware, and kaolin. Earthenware, or common clay, contains many minerals, such as iron oxide (rust), and in its raw state may contain some sand or small bits of rock. Earthenware is a secondary clay that has been transported by moving water some distance, picking up minerals and other materials before settling in a river bed. Because of its many impurities, earthenware melts at a cooler temperature than other clays. Called a low-fire clay, earthenware fires (or bakes) in a temperature range of 1700 to 2100\u00b0F (926\u20131150\u00b0C).
