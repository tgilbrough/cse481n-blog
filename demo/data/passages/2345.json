Below is centroid formulas for some geometric figures: A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with two sides parallel. The centroid of a triangle is the point where the triangle's medians intersect. The centroid is always inside the triangle. In the case of an equilateral triangle, incenter, circumcenter, centroid and orthocentre occur at the same point."}]
