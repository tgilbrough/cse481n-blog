Since its beginning in Japan, Reiki has been adapted across varying cultural traditions. It uses a technique commonly called palm healing or hands-on-healing. Through the use of this technique, practitioners believe that they are transferring universal energy through the palms of the practitioner, which they believe encourages healing. Reiki is considered pseudoscience. It is based on qi (chi), which practitioners say is a universal life force, although there is no empirical evidence that such a life force exists.
