The phenotype includes physical characteristics, behaviors corresponding to such species, structures, organs, behaviors, relfexes, etc. The genotype is the genetic programming that provides the phenotype. The phenotype is a physical manifestation of the genotype, which means that it's what happens on the outside because an organism has the gene. An example of a \u2026 phenotype would be if someone had blue eyes or something."}, {"url": "http://www.differencebetween.net/science/difference-between-genotype-and-phenotype/", "passage_text": "Genotype vs Phenotype. Genotype and phenotype are terms used to differentiate between the genetic makeup of an organism and the way it expresses itself. There are interesting differences between the two terms. Let\u2019s find out what they are: A genotype refers to the actual set of genes that an organism carries inside. 1. Genotype decides the genetics and inherited traits of an organism, but phenotypes refer to the actual display of these traits. 2. Genotypes are decided by inherited genes, while phenotype are determined by the effect of environmental factors. 3. The genotype largely determines the ultimate phenotype of an organism."}, {"url": "http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BIO48/5.Geno.Pheno.HTML", "passage_text": "PHENOTYPE AND GENOTYPE. Definitions: phenotype is the constellation of observable traits; genotype is the genetic endowment of the individual. Phenotype = genotype + development (in a given environment). To consider these in the context of evolutionary biology, we want to know how these two are related. "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypes", "passage_text": "A phenotype (from Greek phainein, meaning to show, and typos, meaning type) is the composite of an organism 's observable characteristics or traits, such as its morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, phenology, behavior, and products of behavior (such as a bird's nest). A phenotype results from the expression of an organism's genes as well as the influence of environmental factors and the interactions between the two. When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species, the species is called polymorph."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_are_Genotype_and_Phenotype", "passage_text": "It's a genotype.

"}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_are_Genotype_and_Phenotype", "passage_text": "Genotype refers to the genetic traits in an organism. It has to do with the genetic coding of an organism. Such coding is inheritable. The genotype is the genetic load that is copied every time a cell divides, and therefore is inherited down to the next generation.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The genotype\u2013phenotype distinction is drawn in genetics.  Genotype  is an organism's full hereditary information.  Phenotype  is an organism's actual observed properties, such as morphology, development, or behavior. This distinction is fundamental in the study of inheritance of traits and their evolution. An organism's genotype is a major (the largest by far for morphology) influencing factor in the development of its phenotype, but it is not the only one. Even two organisms with identical genotypes normally differ in their phenotypes. One experiences this in everyday life with monozygous (i.e. identical) twins."}]
