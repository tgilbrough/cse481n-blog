A prothrombin time test can be used to check for bleeding problems. PT is also used to check whether medicine to prevent blood clots is working. A PT test may also be called an INR test. INR (international normalized ratio) stands for a way of standardizing the results of prothrombin time tests, no matter the testing method. So your doctor can understand results in the same way even when they come from different labs and different test methods."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time", "passage_text": "The prothrombin time (PT) \u2014 along with its derived measures of prothrombin ratio (PR) and international normalized ratio (INR) \u2014 are assays evaluating the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. This test is also called ProTime INR and PT/INR. They are used to determine the clotting tendency of blood, in the measure of warfarin dosage, liver damage, and vitamin K status.

The INR is a test of blood clotting, which is primarily used to monitor warfarin therapy, where the aim is to maintain an elevated INR in a certain range eg, 2.0 to 3.0.

If you take blood thinners, also called anti-clotting drugs or anticoagulants, it's especially important to check your INR. The INR is figured out using the results of the prothrombin time (PT) test, which measures the time it takes for your blood to clot. These include the method each lab uses to do the test. Even if your test results are different from the normal value, you may not have a problem. To learn what the results mean for you, talk with your health care provider. The INR is a ratio, so it's just a number, not a number tied to time or another value."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_an_INR_blood_test", "passage_text": "This is a test derived from another, the prothrombin ratio. It measures the extrinsic clotting pathway system, commonly used to measure warfarin (blood thinning) drugs. A normal, healthy person will have an INR of 1. In warfarin therapy, an INR is usually aimed for around 2. INR is the international normalized value for prothrombin time. It is a value that measures the extrinsic pathway of clotting, and is often used to determine how quickly the person will make clots.
