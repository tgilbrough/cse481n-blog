Ammonium is also a general name for positively charged or protonated substituted amines and quaternary ammonium cations (NR 4 +), where one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by organic groups (indicated by R).

It is a colourless gas with a characteristic pungent smell. Ammonia contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilizers. Ammonia is a colourless gas with a characteristic pungent smell. It is lighter than air, its density being 0.589 times that of air. It is easily liquefied due to the strong hydrogen bonding between molecules; the liquid boils at \u221233.3 \u00b0C (\u221227.94 \u00b0F), and freezes at \u221277.7 \u00b0C (\u2212107.86 \u00b0F) to white crystals."}, {"url": "http://chemistry.about.com/od/molecularformulas/a/Ammonia-Molecular-Formula.htm", "passage_text": "Ammonia is a gas at ordinary room temperature and pressure.

N and H are symbols for nitrogen and hydrogen respectively, which are elements. Only elements have symbols. Ammonia does not have a symbol but a chemical formula NH3 is ammonia NH4 is ammonium cation it is a positively charged polyatomic cation. Source(s): AP Chem student. EDFF \u00b7 6 years ago.
