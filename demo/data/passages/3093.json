It is perfectly compatible with any other traditional or alternative modality. The BMP (BioMagnetic Pair) studies, detects, classifies, measures and allows the correction of pH imbalances in living organisms. By reestablishing the natural pH balance of the body, different microorganisms such as virus, fungi, bacteria and parasites can be kept under control by our renewed natural defenses."}, {"url": "http://www.biomagnetism.ie/", "passage_text": "The practitioners of the Institute have been Certified to provide BioMagnetism Therapy by the El Centro de Investigacion de Biomagnetismo Medico, S.C. in Mexico, The University of Chapingo, Mexico and by Dr. Isaac Goiz Duran. He is not a Medical Doctor, he is not making a medical diagnosis or providing medical advice or care. You should see a Medical Doctor for medical care, and you should view BioMagnetism Therapy care as additional therapy to the medical care provided by a Medical Doctor. Biomagnetism Therapy is not a substitute for Physician consultation, evaluation, or treatment. Biomagnetism Therapy consists of applying medium intensity magnets between 1000- 15 000 gauss in specific areas of the body in order to help balance the pH levels, of Alkalinity and Acidity in the body"}, {"url": "http://www.biomagnetismusa.com/", "passage_text": "Biomagnetism is a scientifically sound alternative treatment that may help restore and maintain physical and mental health.

In contrast, organisms' use of magnetism in navigation is magnetoception and the study of the magnetic fields' effects on organisms is magnetobiology. The origin of the word biomagnetism is unclear, but seems to have appeared several hundred years ago, linked to the expression animal magnetism.. The present scientific definition took form in the 1970s, when an increasing number of researchers began to measure the magnetic fields produced by the human body."}, {"url": "http://www.shiatsutoronto.org/what-is-biomagnetic-pair-therapy/", "passage_text": "Medical Biomagnetism also called BioMagnetic Pair Therapy is a natural complementary therapy that diagnoses and treats a large number of illnesses through the use of pairs of medium intensity magnets.
