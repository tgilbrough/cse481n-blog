Anchorage is defined by OSHA as a secure point of attachment for lifeline, lanyards or deceleration device. The most overlooked component in a personal fall arrest system is planning for a suitable anchorage point. The following guidelines should be followed when planning or determining anchorage and connection: 1 Inspect anchorage connector attachment point for corrosion, cracks, deformities or other defects that may weaken the structure. 2  Do not attach to vertical structures unless a means of restraining the connector from sliding down the structure is present. 3  Never connect a shock-absorbing lanyard to a retractable lanyard."}]
