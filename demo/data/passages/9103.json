At the beginning of the titration, the EDTA reacts with the remaining calcium ion that has not been complexed. After all the calcium has reacted the next portion of EDTA reacts with the magnesium complex which was formed earlier. One such reagent that is widely used is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). An organic agent which has two or more groups capable of complexing with a metal ion is called a chelating agent. The complex which is formed in this manner is called a chelate."}, {"url": "http://www.york.ac.uk/media/chemistry/informationforschools/copper.doc", "passage_text": "I2(aq) + 2S2O32-(aq) \u2192 2I-(aq) + S4O62-(aq).

An acid-base titration would not at first sight seem to be very helpful. The blue colour of your solution is caused by the Cu2+(aq) ion.
