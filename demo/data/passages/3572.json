Closely examine the map below, which shows the 15 major tectonic plates. As you can see, some of the plates contain continents and others are mostly under the ocean. The border between two tectonic plates is called a boundary. All the tectonic plates are constantly moving \u2014 very slowly \u2014 around the planet, but in many different directions. Some are moving toward each other, some are moving apart, and some are sliding past each other."}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/natural_hazards/tectonic_plates_rev2.shtml", "passage_text": "Where convection currents converge, plates move towards each other. The movement of the plates, and the activity inside the Earth, is called plate tectonics. Plate tectonics cause earthquakes and volcanoes. The point where two plates meet is called a plate boundary. Earthquakes and volcanoes are most likely to occur either on or near plate boundaries. The map shows the world's tectonic plates and the distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes.
