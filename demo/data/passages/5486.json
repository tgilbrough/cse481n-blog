In other words, people build a series of mental filters through biological and cultural influences. Chong and Druckman suggest framing research has mainly focused on two types of frames: equivalency and emphasis frames. Equivalency frames offer different, but logically equivalent phrases, which cause individuals to alter their preferences."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_frame_theory", "passage_text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

The Basics. Framing theory and the concept of framing bias suggests that how something is presented (the frame) influences the choices people make. This idea is important because it is contrary to the central concept of of rational choice theory. The elements of the Communication Frame include: A message, an audience, a messenger, a medium, images, a context, and especially, higher-level moral and conceptual frames. The choice of language is, of course, vital, but it is vital because language evokes frames"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_frame_theory", "passage_text": "Relational frame theory focuses on how humans learn language (i.e., communication) through interactions with the environment and is based on a philosophical approach referred to as functional contextualism.

From the RFT perspective, relational framing is the process that underlies language (see Hayes, et al., 2001). In contrast to the outdated Skinnerian approach which came before it, RFT is a modern, behavior analytic approach to human language. Any stimulus can be related to any other stimulus in accordance with any relational frame. Since natural language has its greatest use in the description and analysis of our environment, the fact that relational framing is arbitrarily applicable does not mean that it is arbitrarily applied."}]
