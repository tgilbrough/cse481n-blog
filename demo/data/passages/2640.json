The thyroid gland covers the windpipe from three sides. Two hormones of the thyroid gland, T3 (thyroxine) and T4 (triiodothyronine), help the body to produce and regulate the hormones adrenaline (also called epinephrine) and dopamine. Hormones are chemical substances that help control certain cells and organs. Other hormones from this gland also help regulate metabolism, which is the process by which calories and oxygen are converted into energy. Without a functioning thyroid, the body would not be able to break down proteins and it would not be able to process carbohydrates and vitamins."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/women/picture-of-the-thyroid", "passage_text": "1 Hypothyroidism: Low production of thyroid hormone. 2  Thyroid damage caused by autoimmune disease is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. 3  Graves disease: An autoimmune condition in which the thyroid is overstimulated, causing hyperthyroidism. The thyroid secretes several hormones, collectively called thyroid hormones. The main hormone is thyroxine, also called T4.

Thyroid hormone controls many activities in your body, including how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats. Diseases of the thyroid cause it to make either too much or too little of the hormone. Thyroid cancer happens when cancer cells form from the tissues of the thyroid gland. Most people with thyroid cancer have a thyroid nodule that does not cause any symptoms. If you do have symptoms, you may have swelling or a lump in your neck.

It participates in these processes by producing thyroid hormones, the principal ones being thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3), which is more active. These hormones regulate the growth and rate of function of many other systems in the body. T 3 and T 4 are synthesized from iodine and tyrosine. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, the most common cause being Graves' disease \u2014an autoimmune disorder. In contrast, hypothyroidism is a state of insufficient thyroid hormone production. Worldwide, the most common cause is iodine deficiency."}, {"url": "http://www.bastyr.edu/news/health-tips/2012/04/what-your-thyroid-and-what-does-it-do", "passage_text": "Because it affects virtually every organ in our bodies, the thyroid gland can be linked to modest changes in body weight and energy levels.
