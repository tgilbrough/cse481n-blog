BVD is responsible for significant economic losses due to decreased milk production, reproductive problems, treatment costs, and mortality. Cost estimates in herds with BVD range from $24 to $200 per cow per year. BVD often interacts with other disease of the respiratory and digestive tract and can affect multiple organ systems. The clinical scenario that occurs when a herd is infected with BVD depends on the level of immune protection in the herd and the strain of the infecting virus. One of the problematic aspects associated with BVD is the presence of persistently infected (PI) cattle."}, {"url": "http://www.nadis.org.uk/bulletins/control-of-bovine-virus-diarrhoea-(bvd).aspx", "passage_text": "The cytopathic BVD virus usually arises from changes in the BVD virus within the PI animal. Mucosal disease is most commonly seen in 6 to 12 month-old calves, and is usually seen as sudden onset depression, fever and anorexia, with excess salivation. Ulcers appear in the mouth and on the muzzle.

Signs of infection vary and include fertility problems such as abortions and birth defects, scour and reduced milk yield. Bovilis BVD is licensed for use in cows and heifers from 8 months old to protect the foetus from infection with BVD virus via the placenta.
