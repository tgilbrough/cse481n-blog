Woven fabric is generally crisp and not stretchy*. It can be as thin as chiffon or as thick as denim. *Some woven fabrics, like stretch denim or stretch poplin, have spandex woven in to give it some stretch. A stretch poplin may have 15% stretch across the grain, which means a 10\u2033 piece of fabric can stretch up to 11.5\u2033. When you think of knit fabrics, think of t-shirts and leggings.

A distinguishing feature of woven fabrics is the lack of stretch. \u2022 Woven fabric does not have a problem with washing. Now, that you know the difference between knit and woven, there is an important fact to remember.

Woven fabrics are made up of a weft-the yarn going across the width of the fabric-and a warp-the yarn going down the length of the loom. The side of the fabric where the wefts are double-backed to form a non-fraying edge is called the selvedge. There are three types of woven fabrics. In satin-weave fabric there is a complex arrangement of warp and weft threads, which allows longer float threads either across the warp or the weft. The long floats mean the light falling on the yarn doesn't scatter and break up, like on a plain-weave."}, {"url": "http://www.craftsy.com/blog/2013/06/knit-vs-woven-fabrics/", "passage_text": "The concept of knit vs. woven fabrics didn\u2019t occur to me until I started knitting. Watching that needle create loops, dipping in and out of each stitch, is fascinating. It\u2019s even more fascinating when you think about it as a fabric that clothes your body. For sewists, knit fabrics are more difficult to work with because they stretch and the edges curl. Beginner sewists, beware! But the nice thing about knit fabrics is that they are usually softer and a bit more breathable than woven fabrics.
