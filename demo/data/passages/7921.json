When a certain gene is known to cause a disease, we refer to it as a single gene disorder or a Mendelian disorder. For example, you may have heard of cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, Fragile X syndrome, muscular dystrophy, or Huntington disease. These are all examples of single gene disorders.

A single gene trait is an allele. An allele is a trait controlled by a single gene. Each allele produces a distinct phenotype. A polygenic trait is a trait in which multiple sets of alleles are used to determine the trait, whereas in a single gene trait aka. a Mendelian trait, only one pair of alleles \u2026 is used."}, {"url": "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/trait", "passage_text": "trait. A characteristic or condition that is determined by one's genes. The color of an animal's coat and the shape of a plant's leaves are physical traits.

The following is a list of some autosomal human traits that have been attributed to a single gene. Although clearly other genes are involved, the inheritance of each of these phenotypic traits acts as if it were governed by a single gene. First, indicate your expression of the trait (i.e., circle the appropriate phenotype)."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/the-influence-of-single-gene-pair-inheritance-on-development.html", "passage_text": "Single gene-pair inheritance occurs when a trait is linked to one gene-pair that consists of two alleles. This is also referred to as Mendelian inheritance. An allele is one part of the gene-pair. One allele is inherited from the father and one is inherited from the mother. One way that this can occur is through single gene-pair inheritance. Single gene-pair inheritance occurs when a trait is linked to one gene-pair that consists of two alleles. Traits that are controlled by a single gene will follow a predictable pattern of inheritance."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_a_single-gene_trait", "passage_text": "A single gene trait is controlled by a single gene.
