Gene mutations related to bile duct cancers are usually acquired during life rather than being inherited. For example, acquired changes in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene are found in most bile duct cancers. Other genes that may play a role in bile duct cancers include KRAS, HER2, and MET. Some of the gene changes that lead to bile duct cancer might be caused by inflammation. But sometimes what causes these changes is not known. Many gene changes might just be random events that sometimes happen inside a cell, without having an outside cause.

Bile ducts collect this bile, draining it into the gallbladder and finally into the small intestine where it aids in the digestion process. Bile duct cancer is also called cholangiocarcinoma. Bile duct cancer is a rare form of cancer, with approximately 2,000 new cases diagnosed in the United States each year. There are three general locations where this type of cancer may arise within the bile drainage system: 1  Within the liver (intrahepatic) affecting the bile ducts located within the liver. The incidence of bile duct cancer increases with age. It is a slow-growing cancer that invades local structures and for that reason, the diagnosis is often made late in the disease process when the bile ducts become blocked. This blockade prevents bile drainage from the liver into the gallbladder and intestine."}]
