Algae are the simplest of these plants, and can range from tiny, single celled things to large, multi-celled plants that cover your backyard pond."}, {"url": "http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=16+2160&aid=2956", "passage_text": "Spores are tiny single cells that are produced by fungi that have hyphae.
