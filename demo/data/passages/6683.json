If you listen to a surgeon and they explain things to you in a way that you can understand then they're a great surgeon.

IQ is 100, with the average range being roughly 90-110. Based on this study, medical professionals skew higher in terms of IQ than any of the other occupation groups included in the study. But it also shows that there are doctors whose IQ scores fall within the average range, and that many doctors must be of above-average but not-too-unusual intelligence rather than extraordinary geniuses.

With the help of specially designed legitimate tests, it is possible to measure a person's intelligence. The average IQ is 100. A score above 100 is considered as above average, while a score below 100 is considered as a below average. An IQ score much below 50 or above 150 is usually not noticed. Studies show that the IQ of half of the population is between 90 and 110, while 25% have higher IQ's, and 25% have lower IQ's. Einstein is considered the 'only' man to have an IQ of about 160. Mensa is a society for people with higher IQ, people in the top 2% (1 in 50). Interpretation. Interpretation of IQ score is helpful in measuring certain aspects of intelligence.

To say that the average surgeon's IQ is 234 is completely ridiculous when 140+ is considered genius and the only people in the world to have a 230+ are the 3 highest IQ's ever recorded. You have obviously done little to no research since it took me about a whole of 10 seconds to find this out. Anyone that scores 2 SDs (meaning an IQ score of 130, at least with regard to the WAIS-IV IQ test) above the mean (IQ = 100) is considered slightly gifted, or a genius (or at least what MENSA will accept and acknowledge as genius)."}]
