Surtsey is a volcanic island off the southern coast of Iceland. It was formed in a volcanic eruption which began 426 ft below sea level, and reached the surface on 14 November 1963. The eruption lasted until 5 June 1967, when the island reached its maximum size. Surtsey (part of an island group off SW Iceland) is on constructive plate boundaries, which means the two plates move away from each other and magma rises to the surface.
