A zygote or a zygocyte is the original cell that comes to creation when a new organism is formed through sexual reproduction. A zygote is formed from the synthesis resulting out of the union of the two distinctive gametes.

Fertilization is the fusion of two haploid gametes to produce a diploid zygote. Each haploid gamete in humans has 23 chromosomes, while the diploid zygote has 46. This fusion usually occurs within 24 hours after the oocyte has been released from the ovary. In humans, each of these gametes has 23 chromosomes-that's half the amount of DNA required for development, so these cells are called haploid cells. The fusion of these two cells is called fertilization and it produces a diploid cell with 46 chromosomes-twice the amount found in each gamete. The fertilized egg is now called a zygote and has just the right amount of DNA needed for normal human development"}, {"url": "http://www.diffen.com/difference/Gamete_vs_Zygote", "passage_text": "edit Formation and Development of Zygotes.
