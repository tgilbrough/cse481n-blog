Small proteins, glucose, and ions are returned to the blood by active transport. Negatively charged ions follow passively, followed by the osmosis of water. About 75% of the filtrate is returned in this section of the nephron. The distal convoluted tubule, urine is then passed through here to the collecting duct where it is concentrated due to its permeability to water. It leaves the collecting duct into the pelvis of the kidney, which leads to the ureter and the bladder where it is stored."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/From_what_part_of_the_nephron_does_secretion_occur", "passage_text": "In Health.

Much of the bloods fluid filters into the glomerulus due to pressure from the circulatory system. Left behind are large proteins and whole cells, which are too large to fit through. The distal convoluted tubule, urine is then passed through here to the collecting duct where it is concentrated due to its permeability to water.

Salt is actively transported out of the filtrate, and since this area impermeable to water, water cannot follow the ions out here.

Tubular secretions: It is the mechanism by which substances are removed from the blood and are directly added to the tubular fluids. Hydrogen ion, ammonium and drugs such as penicillin are some of the substances that move from the blood into the distal tubule of nephron. Secretions keep the blood from becoming acidic."}]
