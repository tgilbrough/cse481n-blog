Water soluble wax, Carbowax, polyethylene glycol and PEG are all terms used to describe the same material. Chemically they are polyethylene glycols of varying degrees of polymerisation and molecular weights, or polyethylene glycol fatty acid esters, such as polyethylene glycol monostearate. Like paraffin waxes, polyethylene glycol is usually a mixture of materials with varying molecular weights, due in this case to varying degrees of polymerisation, rather than a single molecular entity. When purchasing, the molecular weight has to be specified to ensure the correct material."}, {"url": "http://mitsuichemicals.com/hiwax.htm", "passage_text": "HI-WAX\u2122 Polyethylene Wax. Solid or semisolid matter at room temperature Low melting point, melted at room temperature ~150\u00b0C Cystalline low molecular resin Molecular weight: 300 ~10,000 (low molecular). HI-WAX\u2122 is a polyethylene wax with various grades in Polymerization type, Modified type and Thermally Cracking type. The wax can be used as a slip agent, disperant, resin modifier, and mold release agent due to its molecular structure, which enables it to outperform natural waxes.
