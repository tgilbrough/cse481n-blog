Deuterium is one of the isotopes of hydrogen. It has one proton and one neutron. The most common isotope of hydrogen is protium, which has one proton and no neutrons. Because deuterium contains a neutron, it is more massive or heavier than protium, so it is sometimes called heavy hydrogen. By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. 1 Deuterium is a stable isotope of hydrogen. 2  The natural abundance of deuterium in the ocean is approximately 156.25 ppm, which is one atom in 6,400 of hydrogen. 3  The name for deuterium comes from the Greek word deuteros, which means second."}, {"url": "http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/deuterium", "passage_text": "deuterium. the mass 2 isotope of hydrogen; it is available as a gas or heavy water and has been used as a tracer or indicator in metabolic studies.
