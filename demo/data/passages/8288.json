[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vole", "passage_text": "The average life of the smaller vole species is three to six months. These voles rarely live longer than 12 months. Larger species, such as the European water vole, live longer and usually die during their second, or rarely their third, winter. As many as 88% of voles are estimated to die within the first month of life. Description [edit]. Voles are small rodents that grow to 3\u20139 in (7.6\u201322.9 cm), depending on the species. They can have five to 10 litters per year. Gestation lasts for three weeks and the young voles reach sexual maturity in a month."}, {"url": "http://a-z-animals.com/animals/water-vole/", "passage_text": "The Water Vole is found throughout the UK and Europe, with it's range even extending into parts of Russia and populations are also found in certain parts of Canada and North America.

It is often informally called the water rat, although it only superficially resembles a true rat. As a large and common microtine rodent, the range of predators faced by the European water vole is truly daunting. However, many species of predator prefer other rodents, such as Microtus voles and wood mice, due to their greater numerical abundance."}, {"url": "http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/water-vole", "passage_text": "Lives along rivers, streams and ditches, around ponds and lakes and in marshes, reedbeds and areas of wet moorland. Look out for the signs of Water Voles such as burrows in the riverbank, often with a nibbled 'lawn' of grass around the entrance. Water Voles like to sit and eat in the same place, so piles of nibbled grass and stems may be found by the water's edge, showing a distinctive 45\u00b0 angled-cut at the ends."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Water_Vole", "passage_text": "The binomial applied to the water vole is Arvicola amphibius, it was formerly known by the junior synonym A. terrestris.
