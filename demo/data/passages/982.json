May is to be commended for her devotion to her heroine in this crack tale. I will be happy to tell friends to curl up with THE DETERMINED HEART on a cold weekend this fall. Antoinette May has put the author back in the center of her own life. She puts to rest any idea that Shelley's production of *Frankenstein* was a one-off fluke. Shelley was a stunning, original thinker who wrote incessantly, despite a series of tragedies in her twenties that would have broken a lesser person."}, {"url": "http://antoinettemay.com/", "passage_text": "Nob Hill Gazette.

Her mother died from complications of a difficult childbirth. Mary and a stepsister, Fanny, were raised by William Godwin. When Mary was four, her father remarried, bringing another stepsister, Claire, into the household, along with a stepmother who was so glaringly different from her brilliant mother that Mary could not help but rebel. Mary makes the best of a situation that isn\u2019t exactly what she imagined. She and her poet do have a life filled with passion, love, and intellectual engagement.
