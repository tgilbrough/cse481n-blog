For instance, carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years. After an organism has been dead for 60,000 years, so little carbon-14 is left that accurate dating can not be established. Potassium-40 has a half-life of 1.3 billion years, and so this method is applicable to the oldest rocks. Radioactive potassium-40 is common in micas, feldspars, and hornblendes, though the closure temperature is fairly low in these materials, about 350 \u00b0C (mica) to 500 \u00b0C (hornblende)."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Which_isotope_is_most_commonlt_used_in_the_radioactive_dating_of_the_remains_of_organic_materials", "passage_text": "Radioa \u2026 ctive isotopes decay from their parent isotope to daughter isotope at a constant rate (under any circumstances).

Barium-137m has a half-life of minutes and is responsible for all of the gamma ray emission. The ground state of barium-137 is stable. These gamma rays can be used, for example, in radiotherapy such as for the treatment of cancer, in food irradation, or in industrial gauges or sensors. Cs-137 is not widely used for industrial radiography as other nuclides, such as cobalt-60 or iridium-192 for example, offer higher radiation output for a given volume."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating", "passage_text": "Radiometric dating (often called radioactive dating) is a technique used to date materials such as rocks or carbon, in which trace radioactive impurities were selectively incorporated when they formed.

Carbon-14 is produced continuously in the Earth's upper atmosphere as a result of the bombardment of nitrogen by neutrons from cosmic rays. Atoms of the same element with differing atomic weights are called isotopes. Radioactive decay is a spontaneous process in which an isotope (the parent) loses particles from its nucleus to form an isotope of a new element (the daughter)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_hydrogen", "passage_text": "Of these, 5 H is the most stable, and 7 H is the least. Hydrogen is the only element whose isotopes have different names that are in common use today.

In some situations, the patient is required to breath oxygen gas labelled with oxygen-15. Radioactive isotopes and radioactively labelled molecules are used as tracers to identify abnormal bodily processes.
