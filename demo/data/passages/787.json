The slug is part of a subset of units known as the gravitational FPS system, one of several such specialized systems of mechanical units developed in the late 19th and the 20th century. Geepound was another name for this unit in early literature. The name slug, as a unit of inertia, was coined before 1900 by British physicist Arthur Mason Worthington, but it did not see any significant use until decades later. A 1928 textbook says: No name has yet been given to the unit of mass and, in fact, as we have developed the theory of dynamics no name is necessary."}, {"url": "http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/Slug.htm", "passage_text": "Definition: Among it's various definitions, in desktop publishing a slug is information used to identify a story, a word processing file, or a document shared among others for review and editing or other processing."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug", "passage_text": "Thus, for example, the various families of land slugs are not closely related, despite a superficial similarity in the overall body form. The shell-less condition has arisen many times independently during the evolutionary past, and thus the category slug is emphatically a polyphyletic one. The bottom side of a slug, which is flat, is called the 'foot'. Like almost all gastropods, a slug moves by rhythmic waves of muscular contraction on the underside of its foot. It simultaneously secretes a layer of mucus that it travels on, which helps prevent damage to the foot tissues."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug", "passage_text": "Slugs live on land and in saltwater, and one genus, Acochlidium, lives in freshwater. The unadorned word slug, however, is applied primarily to land slugs, whereas slugs from the sea or from fresh water are usually referred to as  sea slugs  or freshwater slugs.

Since the acceleration of gravity in US common units is 32.2 ft/s 2, it follows that the weight of one slug is 32.2 pounds. The comparison of the slug and the pound makes it clear why the size of the pound is more practical for commerce.
