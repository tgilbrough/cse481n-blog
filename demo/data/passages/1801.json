As they spread, alternaria leaf spots may change in color from black to tan or gray, with a yellow halo around the outside. Because spot development is heavily influenced by the environment, there are frequently noticeable concentric rings that spread from the initial point of infection. The fungal pathogens in the genus Alternaria can be devastating to plants year after year. The spores overwinter on old plant debris and attach themselves to seeds, making alternaria leaf spot especially tricky to completely eliminate if you save your own seeds."}, {"url": "http://extension.unh.edu/resources/representation/Resource000572_Rep594.pdf", "passage_text": "Early blight, caused by the fungus Alternaria, and Septoria leaf spot, caused by the fungus Septoria, aretwo destructive tomato diseases which occur each year in the northeastern United States.

Alternaria solani is a fungal pathogen, that produces a disease in tomato and potato plants called early blight. The pathogen produces distinctive bullseye patterned leaf spots and can also cause stem lesions and fruit rot on tomato and tuber blight on potato. Early blight caused by A. solani is the most destructive disease of tomatoes in the tropical and subtropical regions. Each 1% increase in intensity can reduce yield by 1.36%, and complete crop failure can occur when the disease is most severe."}, {"url": "http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/plant-problems/disease/alternaria-leaf-spot.htm", "passage_text": "Alternaria leaf spot in the garden is a real problem for growers of brassicas, but it also makes life miserable for tomato and potato growers, causing plaque-like spots on leaves and fruits.

It normally occurs during hot weather when there has been a significant amount of rain and humidity. Once a plant is infected tomato early blight alternaria, a fungicide can be sprayed on the plant. This can help reduce the damage from the plant, but frequently this will only lessen, not eliminate the problem.
