Wi-Fi is the name of a wireless networking technology that uses radio waves to provide high-speed network and Internet connections. This Webopedia Did You Know... article explains Wi-Fi technology: how it works and misconceptions about Wireless Fidelity. Wi-Fi is simply a trademarked term meaning IEEE 802.11x. The false notion that the brand name Wi-Fi is short for wireless fidelity has spread to such an extent that even industry leaders have included the phrase wireless fidelity in a press release."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100316092234AADx32c", "passage_text": "Wi-Fi is a term for a network, almost always one that shares an Internet connection. Any mobile device that supports connecting to the Internet has Wi-Fi capabilities, and free Wi-Fi just means it's unsecure. Secure means you have to type a passcode to get in. WiFi itself does not mean Internet, but in the context Free WiFi it means free internet. WiFi works only with WiFi compatible mobile devices, like a WiFi enabled laptop (almost all sold today are wifi-enabled) and some mobile phones like iPhones."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "passage_text": "The Wi-Fi Alliance defines Wi-Fi as any wireless local area network (WLAN) product based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ' (IEEE) 802.11 standards. These can connect to a network resource such as the Internet via a wireless network access point. Such an access point (or hotspot) has a range of about 20 meters (66 feet) indoors and a greater range outdoors."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111116205217AA8x9P6", "passage_text": "Best Answer: WiFi stands for WIRELESS FIDELITY. WiFi, is a method of connecting to the internet. Wifi is not illegal, unless you connect to somebody else's wireless network without their permission. Wifi is used more commonly instead of wired internet connection. Wi-Fi (/\u02c8wa\u026afa\u026a/) or Wifi, is a mechanism for wirelessly connecting electronic devices.
