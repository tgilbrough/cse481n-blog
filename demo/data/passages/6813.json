The idea behind using proton beam treatments to decimate a tumor is that protons have a larger mass, shorter penetration distance and thus less scatter of radiation than more traditional sources of radiation therapy such as X-rays."}, {"url": "http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/821412", "passage_text": "In comparison, acquisition costs for IMRT systems range from $1.8 million to $5.4 million, according to a 2009 report by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) on management options for low-risk prostate cancer. The cost of therapy is also an issue. For a 65-year-old man with localized low-risk prostate cancer, the average lifetime cost of treatment with IMRT is $43,122 and with proton-beam therapy is $59,979, according to the ICER report. Proton-beam therapy is not new, but its use for medicinal purposes has greatly increased during the past decade. Much of the controversy related to this treatment arose because of cost. The cost to construct and equip a facility to provide proton-beam therapy ranges from $25 million to $150 million."}, {"url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23546839", "passage_text": "Although in use for over 40 years, proton beam therapy for prostate cancer has only recently come under public scrutiny, due to its increased cost compared to other forms of treatment.

The treatment also has a much higher price tag. The major issue with proton therapy is the cost of the treatment and of the treatment facility.

However, as with all medical knowledge, understanding of the interaction of radiation (proton, X-ray, etc.) with tumor and normal tissue is still imperfect."}, {"url": "https://www.protonbob.com/about-proton-therapy/proton-therapy-myths/myth-2", "passage_text": "Therefore, the likelihood of urinary, rectal, sexual side effects, and secondary cancers is lower with proton. In 2010, Medicare spent $1.06 billion on conventional (X-ray) radiation therapy. That same year, Medicare spent $41.8 million on proton therapy, or less than 4% of X-ray cost.

Nov. 1, 2012 (Boston) -- A pricey new treatment for prostate cancer called proton beam therapy appears to cause slightly less diarrhea, bloating, and cramping than traditional radiation treatments. But the effect is short-lived, a new study suggests. Patients say proton beam therapy sounds so much better, they want it no matter what the cost, says Colleen Lawton, MD, a radiation oncologist at the Medical College of Wisconsin Clinical Cancer Center in Milwaukee."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_therapy", "passage_text": "Overall worldwide numbers are hard to compile, but one example in the literature shows that in 2003 roughly 26% of proton therapy treatments worldwide were for prostate cancer. Proton therapy for ocular (eye) tumors is a special case since this treatment requires only comparatively low energy protons (about 70 MeV). Proton therapy has been in use for over 40 years, and is a mature treatment technology. However, as with all medical knowledge, understanding of the interaction of radiation (proton, X-ray, etc.) with tumor and normal tissue is still imperfect."}]
