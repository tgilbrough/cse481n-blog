While much of this work can be accomplished with a few general-purpose knives \u2013 notably a large chef's knife, a tough cleaver, and a small paring knife \u2013 there are also many specialized knives that are designed for specific tasks. The term Utility knife is often used for a non-kitchen cutting tool with a short blade which can be replaced, or with a strip of blades which can be snapped off when worn. A utility knife is between a chef's knife and paring knife in size, about 10 cm and 18 cm (4 and 7 inches) in length."}, {"url": "http://allrecipes.com/recipe/13981/eggplant-parmesan-i/", "passage_text": "1 Arrange a single layer of eggplant slices on top of the sauce. 2  Top the eggplant with 1/2 of the cheese mixture. 3  Repeat layering process until all the eggplant and cheese mixture is used. 4  Pour remaining sauce on top of layers, and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese.

The pieces can be used instead of dried bread crumbs. Make sure you tear or cut the bread into small enough pieces so you can incorporate it evenly into the meatloaf. 3) Quinoa Prepare according to package directions, or use leftover quinoa"}, {"url": "http://allrecipes.com/recipe/13981/eggplant-parmesan-i/", "passage_text": "1 Place one layer of eggplant in the pan, brown each side. 2  Repeat with remaining eggplant slices, using additional oil if necessary. 3  In a 9x13 inch baking dish, evenly spread 1 1/2 cups of spaghetti sauce. 4  Arrange a single layer of eggplant slices on top of the sauce. 5  Top the eggplant with 1/2 of the cheese mixture.

Cellulose adds fiber to the food, which is good for people who do not get the recommended daily intake of fiber in their diets, Inman said. It also extends the shelf life of processed foods.
