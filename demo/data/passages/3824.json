In mathematics, a power of 10 is any of the integer powers of the number ten; in other words, ten multiplied by itself a certain number of times (when the power is a positive integer). By definition, the number one is a power (the zeroth power) of ten."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_does_power_means_in_math_terms", "passage_text": "A power is another mathematics term for exponent. For example 5 to the third power is expressed as 53; where the 3 is the exponent. When you see a problem like this, you multiply the larger number by itself, as many times as the number of the exponent or power indicates. For example; 53= 5x5x5=125."}, {"url": "http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0875926.html", "passage_text": "A power is the product of multiplying a number by itself. Usually, a power is represented with a base number and an exponent. The base number tells what number is being multiplied.

Let's first define some terms as they relate to exponents. When you have a number or variable raised to a power, the number (or variable) is called the base, while the superscript number is called the exponent, or power. In a multiplication problem involving exponents, if the bases are the same, the multiplication problem can be simplified by adding the"}]
