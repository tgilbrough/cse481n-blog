There are some drawbacks to sexual reproduction though. there are 3 types of asexual reproduction; budding, regeneration, and mitosis. budding is when the organism grows on the other organism and when it is fully developed it falls off. Ex: Hydra. Regeneration is an organisms ability to re-grow body parts."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction", "passage_text": "Asexual reproduction is the primary form of reproduction for single-celled organisms such as the archaebacteria, eubacteria, and protists. Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms such as animals (some annelid worms [Which ones?] , turbellarians and sea stars), fungi, and plants."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction", "passage_text": "Reproduction (or procreation) is the biological process by which new individual organisms \u2013 offspring \u2013 are produced from their parents. Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known life; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. There are two forms of reproduction: asexual and sexual. Sexual reproduction typically requires the sexual interaction of two specialized organisms, called gametes, which contain half the number of chromosomes of normal cells and are created by meiosis, with typically a male fertilizing a female of the same species to create a fertilized zygote."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction", "passage_text": "Asexual reproduction in liverworts: a caducous phylloid germinating. Asexual reproduction is a mode of reproduction by which offspring arise from a single organism, and inherit the genes of that parent only; it does not involve the fusion of gametes and almost never changes the number of chromosomes. Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual.

Each of two parent organisms contributes half of the offspring's genetic makeup by creating haploid gametes.

Asexual reproduction essentially clones itself. If something can kill one, it can kill them all. In sexual re \u2026 production, there are many different sets of genes so what kills some may not kill all. Because mutations in non-reproductive cells (aka somatic cells) are not heritable and therefore die with the individual in which they occurred. Only mutations that affect repr \u2026 oductive cells (aka germ cells) are inherited by progeny and influence the genetic variation of a population over time."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080924144155AANa0kR", "passage_text": "Report Abuse. asexual reproduction is simply cloning-an exact copy of the single parent genes, while sexual reproduction allows a mixture of alleles creating more variation.

Only one type of cell is involved, with no input from another individual. Because no new genetic material is introduced, there is no variation in the resulting offspring.
