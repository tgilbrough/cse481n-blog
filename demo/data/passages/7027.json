Stored lipids can be derived from the lipids in your diet or from lipids that your body synthesizes. Adipocytes have an almost unlimited capacity to store lipids in cell organelles called lipid droplets, which can grow to a very large size."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_does_the_body_use_lipids_or_fats", "passage_text": "Fats serve as an insulation material to allow body heat to be conserved and fats line and protect delicate internal organs from physical damage.
