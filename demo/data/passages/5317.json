For example, if D equals 10 feet and W equals 5 feet, then 10 feet divided by 5 feet equals 2. The dimension of feet is thereby cancelled out.

For example, if your screen is 87\u201d wide and the throw distance of your projector is 1.3, the projector should be 113\u201d (87x1.3=113\u201d) from the screen.
