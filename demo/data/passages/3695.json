Aminoglycosides like neomycin irreversibly bind to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA. Specifically neomycin binds to four nucleotides of 16S rRNA and a single amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA."}, {"url": "http://wildpro.twycrosszoo.org/S/00Chem/ChComplex/neomycin.htm", "passage_text": "Topical Preparations: 1  Neomycin / amethocaine / permethrin ear drops (GAC ear drops, Arnolds Veterinary Products) 1-2 drops topically twice daily.

The discovery of neomycin dates back to 1949. It was discovered in the lab of Selman Waksman, who was later awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1951. Neomycin belongs to aminoglycoside class of antibiotics that contain two or more aminosugars connected by glycosidic bonds. Aminoglycosides such as neomycin are known for their ability to bind to duplex RNA with high affinity. The association constant for neomycin with A-site RNA has been found to be in the 10 9 M \u22121 range.
