In this section, I'll give the definition with no math: Divergence at a point (x,y,z) is the measure of the vector flow out of a surface surrounding that point. That is, imagine a vector field represents water flow. Then if the divergence is a positive number, this means water is flowing out of the point (like a water spout-this location is considered a source)"}, {"url": "https://www.rp-photonics.com/beam_divergence.html", "passage_text": "1 According to the most common definition, the beam divergence is the derivative of the beam radius with respect to the axial position in the far field, i.e., at a distance from the beam waist which is much larger than the Rayleigh length.

We also note here that a distance measure can always be considered as a divergence measure, however a divergence measure may not satisfy all the conditions of a distance given in (2.1) and thus may not be a distance measure. Such divergence measures will be referred to as pseudo-distance measures."}, {"url": "http://mathinsight.org/divergence_idea", "passage_text": "The divergence of a vector field simply measures how much the flow is expanding at a given point. It does not indicate in which direction the expansion is occuring. Hence (in contrast to the curl of a vector field), the divergence is a scalar. The fact that fluid is flowing out of the sphere is a sign of the positive divergence of the vector field. Rotate with mouse to change perspective. You can move the sphere by dragging it with the mouse."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence", "passage_text": "In vector calculus, divergence is a vector operator that measures the magnitude of a vector field 's source or sink at a given point, in terms of a signed scalar.
