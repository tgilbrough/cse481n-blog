Choose a time clock that prints the time, year, and date on time cards, or sends data to a computer. Install a time card rack, so your employees can easily find their cards. Keep replacement time clock batteries and ribbons to ensure you're prepared when your time clock needs new supplies. Accurate. An electronic time clock records when an employee clocks in or clocks out on a time card, or sends the information to a computer. Many time clocks come with a battery backup that allows employees to track their time worked during a power outage"}, {"url": "http://www.twc.state.tx.us/news/efte/c_time_clock_rounding_.html", "passage_text": "It has been found that in some industries, particularly where time clocks are used, there has been the practice of recording the employee's starting and stopping time to the nearest five minutes, or to the nearest one-tenth or quarter of an hour. Time missed or worked within that interval will not be deducted from or added to the time worked, whereas time missed or worked outside that interval will result in that interval being deducted from or added to the time worked.

The employee is paid $400 per week.
