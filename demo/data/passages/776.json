So for the capacity dimension of Cantor's dust, we can use P = 2 and S = 3: Just as expected, our result is between 0 and 1, somewhere between the dimension of a point and the dimension of a line. Georg Cantor invented this fractal to describe a set of numbers that he had defined, which is now called Cantor's set. It involves the unit interval in the ternary number system. As was stated in the fractal generation examples, this particular Lindenmayer fractal (shown above) is not so visually appealing but is mathematically interesting. This time, let's predict what type of value we will get for the capacity dimension of Cantor's dust. We have already noted that this fractal is produced by removing the middle third of every line at each iteration, and thus the limit of its length is zero (even though the limit of the number of lines is infinite)"}, {"url": "http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CantorSet.html", "passage_text": "Cantor Set.
