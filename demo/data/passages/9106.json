Although beech is now confined to the eastern United States (except for the Mexican population) it once extended as far west as California and probably flourished over most of North America before the glacial period (39). Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. is the only type species of American beech now recognized in North America (9,10,23). Some botanical authorities hold that Northern and Southern beeches vary, and have described the southern form as F grandifolia var. caroliniana (Loud.)

The American Beech tree grows in the southern and eastern parts of the United States. It grows in deciduous forests all over Maine and northern Massachusetts. It grows best in deep, rich, moist, well-drained soils. The American beech is a tall and wide tree. The mature tree size is anywhere from 90 to 100 feet tall, and spreads 50 to 70 feet. The bark that grows on the tree is very smooth, pale and gray. The American Beech tree produces a lot of paper. The animals that feed on the nuts that grow on this tree are: the opossum, black bears, white-tailed deer, rabbits, ruffed grouse, red and gray squirrels, flying foxes, porcupines and others."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beech", "passage_text": "The European beech (Fagus sylvatica) is the most commonly cultivated, although there are few important differences between species aside from detail elements such as leaf shape.
