A variety of bracing methods including no bracing, bracing with cement particle board or oriental strand board, and bracing with single or double X strap are investigated. 9, strap width has a relatively small effect on racking failure load and strap force, but great influence on the deflection. For a 10 times increase in strap width, the racking failure load only increases by about 10%, whereas the deflection is reduced by about 5 times."}, {"url": "http://timber.ce.wsu.edu/Resources/papers/2-1-2.pdf", "passage_text": "It is showed 2.35 times of racking strength for the wall nailed in the same manner as comparedto the results of gypsum wall specimens (Yeh, 1997).Interior finish and sidingsThe spruce wood has been extensively used as interior wall board in Taiwan.

Inthis study, the required minimum racking strength and minimum width for shear wall was proposed to be 500kgf and900mm, respectively. Racking resistance of shear walls decreased linearly as opening area increased. However, whenthe shear wall section left after opening cut is less than the required minimum width for shear wall, the racking resistancewas considerably less than the linear relationship between racking strength and opening area. For example, the required minimum racking is 500kgf for shear wall, then around 955mm can be obtained as the minimum width for shear walls from the equation for NB (SEC) (stabilized. envelope curve for specimens with no hold-down connector)."}, {"url": "http://timber.ce.wsu.edu/Resources/papers/2-1-2.pdf", "passage_text": "Besides, the values of racking strength and shear modulus for thewall specimens with spruce boards applied horizontally was reduced to 61% and 31%, respectively, if the smaller size ofthe finish board with 0.95cm (t) \u00d78.41cm (w) was applied instead.
