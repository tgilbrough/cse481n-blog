Anti-Flagellin FliC is a mouse monoclonal antibody to Salmonella typhimurium flagellin. Flagellin is the major component of the bacterial flagellar filament, which confers motility on a wide range of bacterial species. Flagellin is recognized by TLR5 [1] and induces the activation of NF-\u03baB and the production of cytokines and nitric oxide depending on the nature of the TLR5 signaling complex [2]."}, {"url": "http://www.rockland-inc.com/Product.aspx?id=33980", "passage_text": "Flagellin Antibody Description. Background. Flagellin is a protein found in the hollow cylinder forming the filament in bacterial flagellum. Its structure is helical, which is important for its function. Studies comparing aflagellate Borrelia to flagellated indicate that the flagella have a role in the invasion of human tissue. The N-and C-termini of flagellin form the inner core of the flagellar filament, and the central portion of the protein makes up the outer surface. While the terminus of the protein is quite similar between all bacterial flagellins, the central portion is variable."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellin", "passage_text": "The N-and C-termini of flagellin form the inner core of the flagellin protein, and is responsible for flagellin's ability to polymerize into a filament.

For example, E. coli flagellin have been reported to vary in size from 36 K to 69 K in MW. The epitope recognized by this FLIC-1 monoclonal antibody is not known. FliC is a subunit protein that polymerizes (in conjunction with other proteins) to form the filaments of bacterial flagella in a precise order.
