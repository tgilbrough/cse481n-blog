Complementary colors are any two colors which are directly opposite each other, such as red and green and red-purple and yellow-green. In the illustration above, there are several variations of yellow-green in the leaves and several variations of red-purple in the orchid. Primary Colors: Red, yellow and blue. In traditional color theory (used in paint and pigments), primary colors are the 3 pigment colors that can not be mixed or formed by any combination of other colors. All other colors are derived from these 3 hues. Secondary Colors: Green, orange and purple."}, {"url": "http://www.realcolorwheel.com/complementsneutral.htm", "passage_text": "Opaque Cadmium Red Light or Dark are opposite Cyan which is called Thalo Blue.
