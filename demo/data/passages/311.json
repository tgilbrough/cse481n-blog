Italian Giuseppe Piazzi discovered Ceres on January 1, 1801 while he was searching for a star. He first believed that he had discovered a comet, but he was not confident in his belief. Ceres was the largest known asteroid in the asteroid belt until 2006. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union formed a new class of solar system objects known as dwarf planets. By definition a dwarf planet is spherical and travels in an orbit around the Sun. Ceres fit the definition perfectly."}, {"url": "http://www.arcadiastreet.com/cgvistas/ceres_1070.htm", "passage_text": "Dwarf planets Ceres, Pluto, & Eris Pluto, a Kuiper object, was demoted to the status of dwarf planet in 2006 when the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reviewed Pluto's status in light of the recently discovered Eris, also a Kuiper object, but somewhat larger than Pluto.
