Most commonly, a website domain is the name of the website or URL, and is sometimes called the host name. The host name is a more memorable name to stand in for the numeric, and hard to remember, IP address of a website. This allows the website visitors to find and return to a web page more easily. Every website domain also ends in what is called a top-level domain, which is a two or three letter reference that has something to do either with the country of origin, such as .us for the United States, or with the type of web page it is, such as the very popular .com for commercial web pages."}, {"url": "http://support.hostgator.com/articles/hosting-guide/what-is-the-difference-between-domains-vs-hosting-vs-website", "passage_text": "When you have a site visitor, they use your domain name to view your website.
