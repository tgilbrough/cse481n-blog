The trochlear nerve, also called the fourth cranial nerve or cranial nerve IV, is a motor nerve (a somatic efferent nerve) that innervates only a single muscle: the superior oblique muscle of the eye, which operates through the pulley-like trochlea. The trochlear nerve carries axons of type GSE, general somatic efferent, which innervate skeletal muscle of the superior oblique muscle. The superior oblique muscle ends in a tendon that passes through a fibrous loop, the trochlea, located anteriorly on the medial aspect of the orbit."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochlear_nerve", "passage_text": "The trochlear nerve is unique among the cranial nerves in several respects: 1  It is the smallest nerve in terms of the number of axons it contains. 2  It has the greatest intracranial length. 3  It is the only cranial nerve that exits from the dorsal (rear) aspect of the brainstem.

The trochlear nerve is examined in conjunction with the oculomotor and abducens nerves by testing the movements of the eye. The patient is asked to follow a point (commonly the tip of a pen) with their eyes without moving their head."}, {"url": "http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7603", "passage_text": "Trochlear nerve: The nerve that controls the superior oblique muscle of the eye, one of the muscles that move the eye (extraocular muscles).

The term trochlear nerve comes from the Latin word trochlea, which means pulley.. It is responsible for innervating the superior oblique muscle of the eye, which acts as a sort of a pulley system. The superior oblique muscle allows the eye to move toward the midline of the body and downward simultaneously. In other words, using the superior oblique muscles will cause the eyes to become crossed.. If the trochlear nerve is harmed, a condition called trochlear nerve palsy (or fourth nerve palsy) may result. This condition causes the affected eye to rotate upwards and towards the midline when the person is looking straight ahead."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_function_of_the_trochlear_nerve", "passage_text": "The trochlear nerve is also known as cranial nerve IV (CN-IV).

The trochlear nerve is also known as cranial nerve IV (CN-IV) . It is the only cranial nerve that emerges dorsally from the brain (near the back), giving it the longest pathway. It is the smallest nerve to service the eye. CN-IV passes through the superior orbital fissure, and it provides motor function, or movement. Without the use of the nerve, the superior oblique eye muscle will no longer function properly. The muscle, not the trochlear nerve, is what physically moves the eyeball.
