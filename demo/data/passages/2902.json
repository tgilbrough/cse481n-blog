The eye exam includes questions about your eyesight and a physical exam of your eyes. Ophthalmoscopy, slit lamp exams, and other tests that check vision and eye health are also part of a routine eye exam. But nearsightedness is not a disease, and a nearsighted eye is otherwise normal and healthy. Weigh your desire to have clear vision without glasses or contacts against the risks and cost of surgery.

When young, one can focus from, say, 6 inches to infinity. When you get older, this may become 4 feet to 100 feet. So you buy reading glasses and move the range to, say, 1 foot to 10 feet. The prescription is not very critical here, because 1/2 feet to 5 feet range works just as well for reading. Nearsighted people are usually that way because the range of focus moves closer, but not narrower."}, {"url": "http://www.rebuildyourvision.com/blog/vision-conditions/the-difference-between-farsightedness-and-nearsightedness/", "passage_text": "While farsightedness makes it difficult to see objects that are close-up, nearsightedness makes it difficult to see objects from a distance. Farsightedness is caused by an imperfection in the eye and is usually genetic. Nearsightedness can be caused by any number of factors and has many different degrees of severity. Nearsightedness does not mean that you\u2019re able to see things that are near really well. Nearsightedness, or myopia (or shortsightedness), actually means that seeing things at a distance is difficult for you."}]
