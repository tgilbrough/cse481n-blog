Fry's electronics, for example, recently advertised the Buffalo TeraStation at $1699 for 2 TB of NAS.

Then you add some free software and lots of do-it-yourself labor. Seems to me that puts it in the same price band as the Integrated Big Data Platform.

You can get a Dell\u00ae PC at about $400 and it comes with a terabyte disk drive. WOW! I found one PC for $319 per TB! Teradata, Oracle, IBM, and all the other vendors are headed for the scrap heap of history with those kinds of prices."}, {"url": "http://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/outsourcing/features/article.php/3656346/What-Storage-Costs.htm", "passage_text": "In the mid-tier, the VA is targeting a cost of $20 per GB for 50 TB of storage that meets 250 IOPS on SPC-1 and 25 MBPS on SPC-2.

Over the last 30 years, space per unit cost has doubled roughly every 14 months (increasing by an order of magnitude every 48 months). The regression equation is given by: Several terabyte+ drives have recently broken the $0.10/gigabyte barrier, making the next milestone $0.01/gigabyte, or $10/terabyte."}]
