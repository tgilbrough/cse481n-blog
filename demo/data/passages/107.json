For example, a pair of alleles controlling the same trait, i.e. eye color: one allele codes for blue eyes, another allele for brown eyes. In humans, simple traits such as eye color may be caused by the interaction of only one pair of alleles."}, {"url": "https://quizlet.com/11560131/biology-genetics-theoretical-genetics-flash-cards/", "passage_text": "Genotype: the alleles of an organism. Phenotype: the characteristics of an organism. Dominant allele: an allele that has the same effect on the phenotype whether it is present in the homozygous or heterozygous state. Recessive allele: an allele that only has an effect on the phenotype when present in the homozygous state. Codominant alleles: pairs of alleles that both affect the phenotype when present in a heterozygote. Locus: the particular position on homologous chromosomes of a gene. Homozygous: having two identical alleles of a gene. Heterozygous: having two different alleles of a gene.
