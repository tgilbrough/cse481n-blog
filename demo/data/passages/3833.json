(A few genes produce other molecules that help the cell assemble proteins.) The journey from gene to protein is complex and tightly controlled within each cell. It consists of two major steps: transcription and translation. Together, transcription and translation are known as gene expression. During the process of transcription, the information stored in a gene\u2019s DNA is transferred to a similar molecule called RNA (ribonucleic acid) in the cell nucleus. Both RNA and DNA are made up of a chain of nucleotide bases, but they have slightly different chemical properties."}, {"url": "http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/genes_at_work.htm", "passage_text": "This process is called gene expression. When genes are inactive, they are silent or inaccessible for protein production. At least a third of the approximately 20,000 different genes that make up the human genome are active (expressed) primarily in the brain. Genes that make proteins are called protein-coding genes. In order to make a protein, a molecule closely related to DNA called ribonucleic acid (RNA) first copies the code within DNA. Then, protein-manufacturing machinery within the cell scans the RNA, reading the nucleotides in groups of three."}, {"url": "http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/genetics/vgec/schoolscolleges/topics/geneexpression-regulation", "passage_text": "Gene expression. Gene expression is the process by which the genetic code-the nucleotide sequence-of a gene is used to direct protein synthesis and produce the structures of the cell. Genes that code for amino acid sequences are known as 'structural genes'.
