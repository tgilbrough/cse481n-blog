The skin is the largest organ of the body, with a surface area of 18 square feet. Its two main layers are the epidermis (outer layer) and dermis (inner layer). The epidermis has several strata (layers) that contain four cell types. Loose connective tissue such as adipose tissue (fat) insulates the body, conserving heat. It also contains blood vessels, lymph vessels, and the bases of hair follicles and sweat glands. The fat distribution in this layer gives the female form its characteristic curves."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-papillary-dermis.htm", "passage_text": "The papillary dermis contains blood vessels that serve two primary functions. One of these functions is to provide the tissue of the skin with vital nutrients and oxygen. Ad. The second function of the blood vessels within the papillary dermis to to regulate body temperature. Nerves present in the skin tell the body what the surrounding temperature is. This information can be used to either conserve or dissipate heat by increasing or decreasing blood flow to the dermis."}, {"url": "https://quizlet.com/1402815/deck-26-blood-vessels-and-the-heart-flash-cards/", "passage_text": "What type of blood vessel does not have these three layers.
