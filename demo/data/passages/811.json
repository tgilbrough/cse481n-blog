Most store-bought, whole-wheat bread has about 70 calories per slice, meaning that it contributes 140 calories to the sandwich. A slice of homemade whole-wheat bread has about 120 calories per slice, contributing 240 calories to your sandwich. White bread contributes about 70 calories per slice, as well. Some hearty breads with seeds and nuts may be higher in calories than just plain wheat or white bread.

These numbers are averages, though, because different calories can exist based on brand, ingredients, and serving sizes.
