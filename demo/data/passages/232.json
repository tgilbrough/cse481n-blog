So you need just over 2 yards. I have no idea how much sand weighs but it is heavier than topsoil. topsoil runs about 2 tons per yard. so even with that you need 4 tons. sand is even heavier so the 5 to 6 ton could very well be right in the ball park.

Two tons of dry sand is about 1.5 cubic yards-40.5 cubic feet. You will need to make about 11 trips (if you fill the wheelbarrow) with a four footer and about seven trips with a six footer. I think I would allow most of the morning for the chore. I am looking for a picture of 2 tons of sand. Because I have to move 2 tons tomorrow with 1 wheel barrel tomorrow and I was wondering how long its going to take me....I know a picture wont tell me how long I just want to see what its going to look like.

To be more precise, there are online calculators to help you determine how much you need -- you will need to know the area you want to cover in square feet, and to what depth. One ton of feathers makes more cubic feet than say for instance one ton of silver. So to make this conversion you must know two constants, the weight per CF or CY for that matter and how many cubic feet you have. In this case it is 27 cubic feet or a yard.

I kept waiting for the guy to dump the rest of it. At one point he climbed up into the dump truck with a shovel and I thought he just has to knock the rest of it loose. So here's a visual for those of you like me who can't imagine 2 tons of anything! By the way, I have an 8x14 run and it has about 4 inches of asphalt sand now. I thought I would get 6 inches and have some left over.
