In fact, digestion starts here as soon as you take the first bite of a meal. Chewing breaks the food into pieces that are more easily digested, while saliva mixes with food to begin the process of breaking it down into a form your body can absorb and use. Your digestive system is uniquely designed to turn the food you eat into nutrients, which the body uses for energy, growth and cell repair.

The small intestine is, however, about twice the length of the large intestine and usually measures about 10 feet in length.
