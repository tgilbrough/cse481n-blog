They are classified into three major color groups: the yellow iron oxide (yellow), colcothar (red), black iron oxide (black).

These compounds are used as pigments in a variety of applications. Iron Oxides used in cosmetic and personal care products are synthetic. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists Iron Oxides as a color additive exempt from certification. Iron Oxides are safe for use in coloring products, including cosmetics and personal care products applied to the lips, and the area of the eye, provided they meet certain specifications."}, {"url": "http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/iron_oxide/", "passage_text": "Subscribe. Iron oxide materials yield pigments that are nontoxic, nonbleeding, weather resistant, and lightfast.

It is commonly known as rust or Hematite as well as ferric oxide, red iron oxide, synthetic maghemite, colcothar. In mineral form, iron oxide is known as wustite. Because of its natural coloring properties, it has long been used in ancient festivals as pigments or tattoo inks. The Many Colors of Iron Oxides. The many colors of iron oxide have given cosmetic products their wide range of palette and color selection. According to the list of FDA-approved cosmetic pigments, iron oxides are famous as Pigment Black 11, Pigment Brown 6, Pigment Brown 7 and Pigment Red 101."}, {"url": "http://www.lkabminerals.com/en/Products/Iron-Oxide/", "passage_text": "Iron Oxide. Iron oxide is a chemical compound made up of oxygen and iron. It is commonly known as hematite. Iron Oxide is a mineral, coloured black to steel or silver-gray, brown to reddish brown, or red. It is mined as the main ore of Iron. Iron Oxide's are used as core sand additives to improve sand quality and suppress the incidence of several sand/binder related defects such as lusterous carbon defects, surface carbon pick up in stainless steels, finning/veining, piholing and orange peel defect in shell moulding sands."}, {"url": "http://www.lkabminerals.com/en/Products/Iron-Oxide/", "passage_text": "Iron Oxide product uses.

Iron oxides and oxide-hydroxides are widespread in nature, play an important role in many geological and biological processes, and are widely used by humans, e.g., as iron ores, pigments, catalysts, in thermite (see the diagram) and haemoglobin. Common rust is a form of iron(III) oxide. Iron oxides are widely used as inexpensive, durable pigments in paints, coatings and colored concretes. Colors commonly available are in the earthy end of the yellow/orange/red/brown/black range. When used as a food coloring, it has E number E172.

It is one of the three main oxides of iron, the other two being iron(II) oxide (FeO), which is rare, and iron(II,III) oxide (Fe 3 O 4), which also occurs naturally as the mineral magnetite. As the mineral known as hematite, Fe 2 O 3 is the main source of iron for the steel industry. Fe 2 O 3 is ferromagnetic, dark red, and readily attacked by acids. Iron(III) oxide is often called rust, and to some extent this label is useful, because rust shares several properties and has a similar composition."}]
