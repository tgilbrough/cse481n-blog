The space between the clasts is generally filled with smaller particles and/or a chemical cement that binds the rock together. Conglomerate can have a variety of compositions. As a clastic sedimentary rock it can contain clasts of any rock material or weathering product that is washed downstream or down current. The rounded clasts of conglomerate can be mineral particles such as quartz or they can be sedimentary, metamorphic or igneous rock fragments. The matrix that binds the large clasts together can be a mixture of sand, mud and chemical cement"}]
