Definition: a hill resulting from differential weathering and erosion between the former feeder tube of a volcano and its surrounding rocks. A volcanic plug, also called a volcanic neck or lava neck, is a volcanic landform created when lava hardens within a vent on an active volcano. When forming, a plug can cause an extreme build-up of pressure if volatile-charged magma is trapped beneath it, and this can sometimes lead to an explosive eruption"}, {"url": "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Volcano+(geological+landform)", "passage_text": "1. a.

They are above sea level and below the oceans. What a volcano actually is a hole in the Earth\u2019s crust that lava and other Earth debris come out of a lot of the. time or even hundreds of years apart. A lot of volcanoes are in a form of a mountain or a hill that have a crater from past eruptions. Many times, before an eruption, there is activity in the Earth\u2019s surface that make the ground shake or even the crater in the volcano grow. Scientists are getting better at predicting eruptions.

Volcanic landforms are controlled by the geological processes that form them and act on them after they have formed.
