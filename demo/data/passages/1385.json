Unlike muscarinic receptors (which are G-protein coupled receptors), nicotinic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels. When bound to acetylcholine, these receptors undergo a conformational change that allows the entry of sodium ions, resulting in the depolarization of the effector cell."}, {"url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2643856/", "passage_text": "1, muscarinic receptors are composed of seven transmembrane helical domains connected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops. Initially, on the basis of pharmacological selective affinity to the muscarinic agonist pirenzepine, two subtypes of muscarinic receptors, M 1 R and M 2 R, were described (61). In 1987, using molecular cloning techniques, Bonner et al. (14) described five muscarinic receptor subtypes (M 1 R\u2013M 5 R)."}, {"url": "http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Muscarinic+receptors", "passage_text": "muscarinic receptors. cholinergic receptors of autonomic effector cells (and also on some autonomic ganglion cells and some central neurons) that are stimulated by muscarine and parasympathomimetic drugs and antagonized by atropine."}, {"url": "http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/biology/rbi-handbook/non-peptide-receptors-synthesis-and-metabolism/acetylcholine-muscarinic-receptor.html", "passage_text": "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
