It stains Gram positive and is non-moving small round shaped or non-motile cocci. It is found in grape-like (staphylo-) clusters. This is why it is called Staphylococcus. Of the variety of manifestations S. aureus may cause: 1  Minor skin infections, such as pimples, impetigo etc. 2  It may cause boils (furuncles), cellulitis folliculitis, carbuncles. 3  It is the cause of scalded skin syndrome and abscesses."}, {"url": "http://www.healthhype.com/staphylococcus-aureus.html", "passage_text": "Staphylococcus aureus (Gk. staphyle = bunch of grapes; Lat. coccus = spherical bacterium, aureus = golden) or golden staph (pronounced \u2018staff\u2019) is the most common species of staphylococcus bacteria causing infections in human.

The results of experiments in animal models of infection have revealed that staphylococcal capsules are important in the pathogenesis of S. aureus infections. The capsule enhances staphylococcal virulence by impeding phagocytosis, resulting in bacterial persistence in the bloodstream of infected hosts. Opsonization of S. aureus is critical for uptake and killing of the bacterium by professional phagocytic cells. Complement and antibody are the principal serum opsonins and have been shown to play an important role in opsonophagocytic killing of the staphylococcus (69, 87, 116, 117)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus", "passage_text": "S. aureus can cause a range of illnesses, from minor skin infections, such as pimples, impetigo, boils, cellulitis, folliculitis, carbuncles, scalded skin syndrome, and abscesses, to life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, toxic shock syndrome, bacteremia, and sepsis.
