Widely marketed as a weight-loss supplement, the fiber from konjac root, also known as glucomannan, appears to have some other medicinal properties of interest. These include the ability to inhibit absorption of cholesterol and glucose by the gastrointestinal system, as well as strong laxative effects. It is important that they take these properties of the konjac root fiber into consideration before beginning to use products containing glucomannan. The net effect of taking both without first consulting a health professional could be to reduce serum glucose and/or lipids beyond levels that are considered healthy."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-205-GLUCOMANNAN.aspx?activeIngredientId=205&activeIngredientName=GLUCOMANNAN", "passage_text": "Glucomannan is a sugar made from the root of the konjac plant (Amorphophallus konjac). Glucommanan powder, capsules, and tablets are used as medicine. Glucomannan is used for constipation, weight loss in adults and children, type 2 diabetes, blood sugar control, and lowering cholesterol. In foods, glucomannan is used as a thickener or gelling agent. Glucommanan flour and powder are used in food. Glucomannan might work in the stomach and intestines by absorbing water to form a bulky fiber which treats constipation. It may also slow the absorption of sugar and cholesterol from the gut, helping to control sugar levels in diabetes, and reducing cholesterol levels."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/149231-side-effects-of-konjac-root/", "passage_text": "Widely marketed as a weight-loss supplement, the fiber from konjac root, also known as glucomannan, appears to have some other medicinal properties of interest.
