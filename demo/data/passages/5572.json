Aqueous solutions of acids have a pH of less than 7. Non-aqueous acids are usually formed when an anion (negative ion) reacts with one or more positively charged hydrogen cations. A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H + and one mole of the conjugate base, A \u2212 , and none of the protonated acid HA."}, {"url": "http://openstudy.com/updates/51b508a5e4b06ee3ee2855b8", "passage_text": "You've already chosen the best response. strong acids give up hydrogen ions when dissolving in water, and do so very nearly completely. a strong acid does not have to have a high concentration (you could mix a small quantity with a large volume of water, which would make a low concentration of a strong acid).

For the purpose of this exercise, we will consider the Arrhenius definition of acids and bases, in which an acid is a proton (H +) donor and a base produces hydroxide (OH -) in solution. There are several different types of acid-base titrations. To understand the difference, we must briefly review what a strong acid/base vs. a weak acid/base is. A strong acid is an acid that is said to completely dissociate, meaning that every molecule of that acid in solution gives off an H +"}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100314224837AAycEUE", "passage_text": "Here's why: An acid has a pH below 7. At exactly pH 7 a solution is neutral. Any pH above 7 is basic. Electrolytes are compounds that dissociate (separate) in solutions. Strong acids/bases are strong electrolytes. Weak acids/bases are weak electrolytes. So, answer C is incorrect because it could be true or false depending upon what kind of acid you have. Acids want to get rid of H+ ions (it's part of what characterizes them). Bases have an affinity for H+ ions and want to pick them up.

Conversely, it acts as a base when it reacts with an acid. The Br nsted Definition of Acids and Bases. The Brnsted, or Brnsted-Lowry, model is based on a simple assumption: Acids donate H ions to another ion or molecule, which acts as a base. The dissociation of water, for example, involves the transfer of an H + ion from one water molecule to another to form H 3 O + and OH-ions. Acids provide the H + ion; bases provide the OH-ion; and these ions combine to form water. H+(aq) + OH-(aq) H2O(l).

Whether a liquid is an acid or base depends on the type of ions in it. If it has a lot of hydrogen ions, then it is an acid. If it has a lot of hydroxide ions, then it is a base.
