It is an emulsifier, like soy lecithin. It's a gummy substance left behind as a byproduct of the oil extraction for sunflower oil. I get the aversion to grains, I get the aversion to legumes, I get nut avoidance, I get the avoidance of refined fats and sugars-they are high in allergens, high in irritants, often generally lower on the nutrient-density scale, the fats and proteins are lower quality...avoidance often makes sense."}, {"url": "http://paleomagazine.com/soy-lecithin-dumb-paleo-questions/", "passage_text": "First, the answer is obvious: Of course Soy Lecithin isn\u2019t Paleo. If you Google it and read 3 sentences about what it is, then it\u2019s obvious that it didn\u2019t exist a thousand years ago, much less a million. It\u2019s used in a very wide variety of foods, including confectionery, doughs, and cooking sprays, and candy bars. The main benefit of soy lecithin is that it acts as an emulsifier, which means that it stabilized foods like candy bars and makes them stick together instead of breaking apart."}, {"url": "http://www.paleoplan.com/2012/05-01/qa-is-soy-lecithin-paleo/", "passage_text": "Mark. I just noticed that one of my supplements contains soy lecithin. I know it\u2019s a by product of the soy after the oil has been extracted and according to the information I\u2019ve attached, it is actually not very good for you, despite previous claims that it is excellent for many things. I think we pick our battles with Paleo, and sometimes soy lecithin wins. For instance, when I was a chocolate eater, before I realized that it gave me acne and ocular migraines, I didn\u2019t give a damn whether my Almond Sea Salt Chocolove had soy lecithin in it."}, {"url": "http://thepaleolist.com/2014/06/23/is-sunflower-lecithin-paleo/", "passage_text": "Much like soy lecithin, it really isn\u2019t the end of the world if you get a little processed lecithin in your dark chocolate \u2013 the benefits outweigh the harm \u2013 but it\u2019s not something you should consume excessively. It is also used as a healthy supplement due to its high concentration of choline (also found in eggs and liver).

You could pour it over nuts and seeds and dried fruit and make a cereal type snack. Or you could drink it.
