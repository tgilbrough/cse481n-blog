Fungi are eukaryotic, heterotrophic organisms with rigid cell walls that typically reproduce by the production of spores. Characteristic of fungi are their cell walls that may contain chitin (a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine), glucans, mannans and cellulose. The fungi are also unique in their ability to reproduce asexually and /or sexually, in either case, with the subsequent production of spores. The familiar fuzzy colonies of molds are, of course, macroscopic.
