People with transplants can live a full, long life. I got my first kidney transplant at the age of 13. Thirty one years later, it wore out just as my second transplant arrived. I've had it for almost four years. I have a full life and compete at the National level in a popular sport. 4 years ago. Hi, I had a kidney and liver transplant when I was 15 and I'm 28 now.I'm still on my first kidney and liver, and i'm doing great. You can have as many kidney transplants as you need.

The average life-span of a transplanted kidney is ten years for a deceased donor kidney, and about 12 years for a living related transplant. The average for a living unrelated transplant is somewhere between the two. Another way of looking at how long a transplanted kidney is likely to last is to look at the percentage chance that the kidney will be working at set time points. 1  a 90% chance (eight or nine out of ten) of working one year after the operation. 2  a 60% chance (six out of ten) of lasting five years;"}, {"url": "http://www.howlongdoes.com/health/how-long-does-kidney-transplant-last/", "passage_text": "How long does kidney transplant last is subject to various external and internal factors. The answer to how long does a kidney transplant last is, on average, most kidney transplants last somewhere between 10 and 12 years. There are chances that some transplants may fail shortly after transplant; some may be so successful that the recipient may not need another one for years. Another important factor in how long does kidney transplant last is that it does not last forever. In essence, the average duration of a transplanted kidney is approximately ten years for a kidney from a donor who has died to about 12 years for a donor who is alive and is a relative. For a donor who is alive and not related to the patient, the answer to how long does the transplant last is between 10-12"}, {"url": "http://www.kidney.org.uk/organ-donation/medical-info-transplant-txwhat/medical-info-transplant-txop/", "passage_text": "If the transplant does not work at the start, dialysis will be required and the patient will need to play a waiting game until the kidney starts working. A \u2018good transplant\u2019 is one that is working well after one year, not two weeks. In about one third of kidney transplants, the kidney does not produce any urine in the first few days (and sometimes weeks) after the transplant.
