A mountain is a natural elevation of the earth\u2019s surface rising more or less abruptly to a summit, and attaining an altitude greater than that of a hill, usually greater than 2000 ft. Related to Mountain: Pyramidal Peak, Mountain Ranges, Mountain Pass. The most common way a mountain is formed is through plate tectonics. The Earth has massive plates that float. These plates can move under and over each other. When one plate moves under another the plate, the other plate rises up to form a mountain. After thousands of years, they mountains can get very high."}, {"url": "http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/earth/surface-of-the-earth/mountains-article/", "passage_text": "Thirty of the world\u2019s highest mountains are in the Himalaya.

Other types of mountains form when stresses within and between the tectonic plates lead to cracking and faulting of the Earth's surface, which forces blocks of rock up and down.

Mountains are in general a much tougher place to life than equivalent lowland habitats, partly due to the lower temperatures and harsher weather.
