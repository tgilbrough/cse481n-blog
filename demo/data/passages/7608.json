It is the passageway through which the ovum passes from the ovary to the uterine cavity. The oviducts are part of the genital tract.

In this clip the structure and function of a ciliated epithelial cell is described. Cilia are tiny hair like structures on the surface of the cell. The hairs sweep hair, mucus, trapped dust and bacteria up to the back of the throat where it can be swallowed.
