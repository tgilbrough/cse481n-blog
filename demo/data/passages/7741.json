[{"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_chemical_formula_of_vinegar", "passage_text": "Vinegar's formula is very dilute CH3COOH. Vinegar is mainly water (H2O), but is also comprised of acetic acid (the boxlike acid which gives vinegar its pungent/sour smell). Vinegar is a liquid produced by aerobic fermentation (meaning: it needs oxygen) of alcohol into acetic acid as well as other fermentation byproducts. The acetic acid concentration ranges from 4 to 9 percent by volume for table vinegar (typically 9 %) and higher concentrations for pickling (up to 18 %) although in some countries the minimum strength may be less. Natural vinegars also contain smaller amounts of tartaric acid, citric acid, and other acids."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinegar", "passage_text": "Vinegar is a liquid consisting mainly of acetic acid (CH 3 COOH) and water. The acetic acid is produced by the fermentation of ethanol by acetic acid bacteria. Vinegar is now mainly used as a cooking ingredient. "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid", "passage_text": "Acetic acid /\u0259\u02c8si\u02d0t\u0268k/ , systematically named ethanoic acid /\u02cc\u025b\u03b8\u0259\u02c8no\u028a\u0268k/ , is an organic compound with the chemical formula CH 3 COOH (also written as CH 3 CO 2 H or C 2 H 4 O 2). It is a colourless liquid that when undiluted is also called glacial acetic acid. Vinegar is roughly 3\u20139% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. Besides its production as household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinylacetate and cellulose acetate. Vinegar is typically 4\u201318% acetic acid by mass. Vinegar is used directly as a condiment, and in the pickling of vegetables and other foods. Table vinegar tends to be more diluted (4% to 8% acetic acid), while commercial food pickling employs solutions that are more concentrated."}, {"url": "http://www.chemicalformula.org/chemistry-help/facts-about-vinegar", "passage_text": "1 Vinegar is a weak acid with a pH of 2-3. 2  Vinegar is a mixture of about 5% acetic and water with a small amount of other flavoring and coloring chemicals which depends on the method of production. 3  eg. balsamic vinegar, apple vinegar, brown vinegar and white vinegar. 1 Vinegar is a mixture of about 5% acetic and water with a small amount of other flavoring and coloring chemicals which depends on the method of production. 2  eg. balsamic vinegar, apple vinegar, brown vinegar and white vinegar. 3  The chemical formula for vinegar is shown by its main component, acetic acid"}, {"url": "http://www.chemicalformula.org/chemistry-help/facts-about-vinegar", "passage_text": "Facts about vinegar. 1  Vinegar is a weak acid with a pH of 2-3. 2  Vinegar is a mixture of about 5% acetic and water with a small amount of other flavoring and coloring chemicals which depends on the method of production. 1 Vinegar is a mixture of about 5% acetic and water with a small amount of other flavoring and coloring chemicals which depends on the method of production. 2  eg. balsamic vinegar, apple vinegar, brown vinegar and white vinegar. 3  The chemical formula for vinegar is shown by its main component, acetic acid"}, {"url": "http://www.chemicalformula.org/vinegar", "passage_text": "Chemical formula for vinegar. Vinegar is composed of about 5% acetic acid. This is the major chemical component of vinegar. The systematic or proper chemical name of acetic acid is ethanoic acid. Vinegar is a weak acid produced by the oxidation of alcohol (ethanol) from wines and ciders by bacteria.

The fermentation is carried out by bacteria. Answer: Vinegar consists of acetic acid (CH 3 COOH), water and trace amounts of other chemicals, which may include flavorings. The concentration of the acetic acid is variable. Distilled vinegar contains 5-8% acetic acid. Spirit of vinegar is a stronger form of vinegar that contains 5-20% acetic acid. Flavorings may include sweeteners, such as sugar or fruit juices"}, {"url": "http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=4147", "passage_text": "Baking soda and vinegar react with each other because of an acid-base reaction. Baking soda is a bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) and vinegar is an acetic acid (HCH 3 COO). One of the products this reaction creates is carbon dioxide. Answer 4: They react because baking soda is a base and vinegar is an acid dissolved in water. When you mix an acid and a base in a solvent, which in this case is the water, usually the acid transfers hydrogen to the base to form a new compound."}, {"url": "http://www.enzyme-facts.com/properties-of-vinegar.html", "passage_text": "Tweet.
