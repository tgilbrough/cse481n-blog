Rhyolitic lava has the highest viscosity of any type of lava, and it has the greatest content of SiO 2. Typically, the SiO 2 content of rhyolitic lava is greater than 68 percent of its total composition. It flows much slower than andesitic and basaltic lava. It has a high iron and magnesium content. It has a relatively low viscosity, when compared to other types of lava. It is the fastest flowing lava.

If the viscosity is low, non-explosive eruptions usually begin with fire fountains due to release of dissolved gases. When magma reaches the surface of the earth, it is called lava.
