To protect the investment made in a Glen Eden Wool carpet or rug, it's important to follow prescribed maintenance periodically to keep it looking and performing at its best.

Properly maintained carpets enhance the appearance and atmosphere of interiors either contract or residential. A well-maintained Glen Eden Wool residential or commercial carpet absorbs dirt, airborne dust particles, fumes and noise. It even makes the indoor environment more hygienic. Maintenance makes sense.
