It is about three times as abundant as uranium and about as abundant as lead or molybdenum. Thorium in its pure form is a silvery-white heavy metal that is about as dense as lead. Thorium-230 is a radioactive decay product of uranium-238 and is found in low concentrations in uranium deposits and mill tailings.

It has several different isotopes, both natural and man-made, all of which are radioactive. The most common form of thorium is thorium -232, found naturally. 1 Th-232 with a half-life of 14.05 billion years, which represents all but a trace of naturally occurring thorium. 2  Th-230 with a half-life of 75,380 years. 3  It occurs as the daughter product of 238U decay."}, {"url": "http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/PHS/PHS.asp?id=658&tid=121", "passage_text": "Smaller amounts of other isotopes of thorium are produced usually as decay products of uranium-238, uranium-235, and thorium-232, and as unwanted products of nuclear reactions. Thorium is used to make ceramics, lantern mantles, and metals used in the aerospace industry and in nuclear reactions. More than 99% of natural thorium exists in the form (isotope) thorium-232.

A radioactive actinide metal, thorium is one of only three radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as a primordial element (the other two being bismuth and uranium).
