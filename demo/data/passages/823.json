Reproductive cells (gametes) have half the normal number i.e. 23. This is because two gametes (one male and one female) have to fuse hence, restoring the original number of 23 pairs. The number of unique chromosomes, including sex chromosomes, is 23 in humans.

Chromosomes are the carriers of hereditary characteristics called genes. The human cell nucleus contains 46 chromosomes (diploidy) in the form of 23 chromosome pairs (23 male, 23 female chromosomes). Every cell with the exception of red blood cells has a nucleus. However, there are cells with two nuclei (some liver cells) or greater numbers of nuclei, e. g., osteoclasts in bony tissue (5\u221220 nuclei) or skeletal muscle cells (more than 1000 nuclei).

That depends on what organism the cell belongs to. A nucleus of a normal human cell contains 46 chromosomes, whereas this is a double chromosome set, i.e. we have 23 pairs of chromosomes that are used for the same functions. Two chromosomes that fulfill the same functions are called homologous.

The 23rd pair, the sex chromosomes, differ between males and females. "}]
