It needs no ghost come from the grave (not that I am one yet or coming from there now) to suppose that a writer as prolific and popular as P.G. Wodehouse must have, over a period of seventy years, attracted the attention of other writers. Some such attention is almost too well-known to mention: Hilaire Belloc\u2019s statement in a U.S. radio broadcast that \u201cP.G. Wodehouse is the best writer of English now alive,\u201d Evelyn Waugh\u2019s definitive observation in a B.B.C. broadcast that \u201cMr. Wodehouse\u2019s idyllic world can never stale. A writer who once wanted \u201call the books of P.G. Wodehouse for the voyage home\u201d (in 1928 they numbered almost 40, counting the school stories) is not forever tucked in the wallet at the back of Time, wherein are alms for oblivion."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._G._Wodehouse", "passage_text": "A third milestone in Wodehouse's life came towards the end of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator.
