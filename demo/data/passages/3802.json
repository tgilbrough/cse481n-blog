It also is known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE. People cannot get mad cow disease. But in rare cases they may get a human form of mad cow disease called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which is fatal. There is no evidence that people can get mad cow disease or vCJD from eating muscle meat-which is used for ground beef, roasts, and steaks-or from consuming milk or milk products. People with vCJD cannot spread it to others through casual contact."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy", "passage_text": "A cow with BSE.
