All electric heaters run on the principle of turning electricity into heat. The most common way to do this is to power up a wire coil and then use a small built-in fan to blow the heat out of the heating enclosure.

So 2 Kw will cost you 2 units. Electricity is charged by Kw per hour or KwH. so for 2 hours your heater will cost 80 pence. There will be a slight saving on this as the heater will have a thermostat on it and it will cut in and out for a few minutes over an hour. Hope this helps.
