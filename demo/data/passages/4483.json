Hypothermia is a medical emergency that occurs when your body loses heat faster than it can produce heat, causing a dangerously low body temperature. Normal body temperature is around 98.6 F (37 C). Hypothermia (hi-poe-THUR-me-uh) occurs as your body temperature passes below 95 F (35 C). When your body temperature drops, your heart, nervous system and other organs can't work normally."}, {"url": "http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothermia/basics/definition/con-20020453", "passage_text": "Hypothermia is a medical emergency that occurs when your body loses heat faster than it can produce heat, causing a dangerously low body temperature.

Hypothermia happens when your body temperature drops way below normal, causing the circulatory, respiratory, and nervous systems to slow down. Normal body temperature is around 98.6 \u00b0F (37 \u00b0C). Hypothermia happens if your temperature drops to 96 \u00b0F (35.5 \u00b0C) or below."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/first-aid/tc/hypothermia-and-cold-temperature-exposure-topic-overview", "passage_text": "Sometimes a normal, healthy adult has a low body temperature, such as 96\u00b0F (36\u00b0C) .
