An aneurysm can lead to serious problems. Your heart pumps blood to the lower part of your body through a large blood vessel called the abdominal aorta.. If an aneurysm develops here, it is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm. 1 A large aneurysm can burst. 2  This is very serious, and can even result in death. 3  If you have a large aneurysm, you may need surgery. 4  Finding large aneurysms with screening before they burst may make the surgery and recovery easier."}, {"url": "http://www.qwhatis.com/what-is-aorta/", "passage_text": "Blood pressure is highest at the aorta and decreases as it travels and divides into arteries, arterioles, and capillaries making the flow slow and smooth for nutrient and gas exchange. Because the aorta is a flexible artery, it beats accordingly with the heart. It made up of an assorted mixture of nerves, endothelial cells, complex extracellular matrix, fibroblast-like cells, intimal cells and smooth muscles.

Specifically, the thoracic aorta is that part of the aorta that starts after the arch of the aorta and runs down to the diaphragm, the great muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen. The thoracic aorta gives off numerous branches that supply oxygenated blood to the chest cage and the organs within the chest. Like the other sections of the aorta (the ascending aorta, aortic arch and abdominal aorta), the thoracic aorta is an arbitrary anatomic entity.

AORTA gets all those separate systems talking to each other, increasing efficiency and reducing overhead costs tied to everyday development, operations, installation, and management. By using APIs, AORTA converts closed systems into open, configurable services. APIs make it possible to automate functions that that would otherwise require multiple steps across multiple systems, optimizing the way you do business.

During your visit you and family members will have ample time to discuss your condition and new symptoms with the doctor. Your primary care physician and cardiologist will be informed by mail of your evaluation and new imaging studies."}]
