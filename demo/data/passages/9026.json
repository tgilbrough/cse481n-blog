In this analogy, the rungs of the ladder are the base pairs (A-T and G-C). The sides of the ladder are the sugar-phosphate backbones of the two strands. This refers to B form DNA."}, {"url": "http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/do53dn.html", "passage_text": "Watson and Crick describe structure of DNA1953. Photo: Model of DNA molecule. In the late nineteenth century, a German biochemist found the nucleic acids, long-chain polymers of nucleotides, were made up of sugar, phosphoric acid, and several nitrogen-containing bases."}, {"url": "https://quizlet.com/11174373/biology-chp-7-flash-cards/", "passage_text": "Which of the following statements about DNA are true.
