When I was preparing to apply, I went to the College Program website and looked up the requirements for the program to make sure that I was eligible. The two main requirements are: that you are at least 18 years old, and that you must be enrolled in a college or university at the time that you apply. When I got back from Florida with my family, it was July and I was getting ready to start school in August and I officially met all of the requirements for the program! Thank you so much for posting this! I recently interviewed for the disney college program and got the pending email from them. When I did I felt like this was just a polite pre-notice to my future email that would say I am not accepted but thank you for explaining it\u2019s just basically a waiting list."}, {"url": "http://www.xmms.org/qna/How_long_does_it_take_to_hear_a_response_for_the_disney_college_program-qna1132658.html", "passage_text": "1 56% - What day of the week did you hear back from disney college program? 2  66% - How long to you know if you got the job for the disney college program? 3  83% - How long does it take to get an answer from disney college program? 4  85% - How long did it take to get a decision from the disney college program? 1 61% - How long before disney college program accepts you? 2  79% - How long does it take to recieve notice from disney college program? 3  65% - How long did it take to recieve an answer from the college disney program? 4  81% - How long does it take to get called back for"}, {"url": "https://disneyprogramsblog.com/the-waiting-game/", "passage_text": "Hi Kristin, 2-3 weeks is a general time frame.
