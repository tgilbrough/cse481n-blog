The pads need replacement on disc brakes on a regular basis. How often they need to be replaced will vary depending on your driving habits. The accepted lifespan of the front disc brake pads is roughly 30,000 miles."}, {"url": "http://blog.iseecars.com/2011/06/21/how-much-does-it-cost-to-replace-car-brakes/", "passage_text": "Keep in mind, this is the repair you\u2019ll face most of the time. If you\u2019re going to a local repair facility you can expect to pay somewhere in the range of $150 to $200 for replacement of the pads and rotors, on average. Nearly half of this cost is in parts, so you may want to consider that if you\u2019re a do-it-yourselfer. If you\u2019re getting front brakes done, you can look at roughly an hour or so at the shop, unless you require more than the standard pad/rotor replacement. If you\u2019re getting rear brakes, look closer to two-to-three hours."}, {"url": "http://cars.costhelper.com/brakes.html", "passage_text": "1 CostHelper readers who bought the needed replacement parts and then paid a mobile mechanic or one at a local shop or gas station to install them report total costs of $80-$430, for an average of $251.
