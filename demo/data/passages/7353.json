RNA polymerase is an enzyme that is used during transcription in the nucleus. Similar to DNA polyme \u2026 rase, RNA polymerase codes for the complementary nucleotides to a DNA strand. Instead of thymine though, uracil codes with adenine."}, {"url": "http://www.biology-questions-and-answers.com/what-role-does-mrna-play-in-transcription-and-translation.html", "passage_text": "by: Anonymous. mRNA is messenger RNA. mRNA is transcribed from DNA, and carries coding information to the ribosomes.

Transcription takes place in two broad steps. First, pre-messenger RNA is formed, with the involvement of RNA polymerase enzymes."}]
