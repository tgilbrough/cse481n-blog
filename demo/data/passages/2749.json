Insulators are used to protect us from the dangerous effects of electricity flowing through conductors. Insulators are materials that have just the opposite effect on the flow of electrons. They do not let electrons flow very easily from one atom to another"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator_(electricity)", "passage_text": "An insulating material used in bulk to wrap electrical cables or other equipment is called insulation. The term insulator is also used more specifically to refer to insulating supports used to attach electric power distribution or transmission lines to utility poles and transmission towers. A perfect insulator does not exist, because even insulators contain small numbers of mobile charges (charge carriers) which can carry current. In addition, all insulators become electrically conductive when a sufficiently large voltage is applied that the electric field tears electrons away from the atoms."}, {"url": "http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/conins.html", "passage_text": "Conductors and Insulators. In a conductor, electric current can flow freely, in an insulator it cannot.

In the case of heat, thermal insulators work by reducing the rate heat can travel through a space. Generally, they use specific materials and will keep heat-carrying matter from moving. The first sense of an insulator is the thermal sense. A thermal insulator helps keep an object at the same temperature, whether hot or cold. It typically works by addressing either conduction or convection, which are two modes of heat transfer."}]
