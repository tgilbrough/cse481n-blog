Spiny-headed worms are dual-host parasites and there are three classes known. The bodies of the acanthocephalans are long, flattened, and vary in length from 1.5 millimeters to 1 meter, but do not include a digestive tract. Instead of a mouth, anus, and digestive tube, nutrients are taken in via pores and by diffusion, while the excretory system is tied to the sexual reproductive system."}, {"url": "http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/optics/olympusmicd/galleries/darkfield/acanthocephalaadultlow.html", "passage_text": "The proboscis also acts as the means of locomotion for these internal parasites.

There is a prominent circular array of cilia at the anterior end of the animal that looks like a rotating wheel. This is known as the Trochal disc or Corona. Rotifers occur primarily in freshwater and all are microscopic. -- There are two kinds of locomotion: (1) ciliary activity on the corona and (2) crawling on vegetation by making particular use of the foot. Pedal glands secrete adhesive material, which comes out on the foot. It can thus adhere to surfaces. The movement is of inch-worm type."}, {"url": "http://waynesword.palomar.edu/trnov01.htm", "passage_text": "In a cross sectional view, animal embryos are composed of an outer layer called ectoderm, a middle layer or mesoderm, and an internal layer or endoderm that surrounds the digestive cavity. Multicellular animals are heterotrophic by ingestion of food into a body cavity (coelom) that is completely lined by the mesoderm. Primitive phyla without a true coelom include the Porifera and Coelenterata (Cnidaria). Animal phyla are classified according to certain criteria, including the type of coelom, symmetry, body plan, and presence of segmentation. Phyla with a true coelom and digestive system are divided into two groups, the protostomes and the deuterostomes. As the hollow sphere of cells known as a blastula develops, an invagination produces an opening called the blastopore."}, {"url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General_Biology/Classification_of_Living_Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla", "passage_text": "Animals in this phyla have no true tissues, which means, for example, that they have no nervous system or sense organs.
