(DRI) for use with the DOS operating system on the Intel 8088 and Motorola 68000 microprocessors. In this form the system could not run other GEM programs. This led to a situation where a number of applications (including ViewMAX) could exist all with their own statically linked copy of the GEM system. This scenario was actually rare, as few native GEM programs were published."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_Environment_Manager", "passage_text": "A new module, GEM AES (Application Environment Services), provided the window management and UI elements, and GEM Desktop used both libraries in combination to provide a GUI.
