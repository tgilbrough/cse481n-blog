Try to look at this mnemonics: There are three major types of volcanoes: the composite volcano, the cinder cone volcano, and the shield volcano. Among these three types of volcanoes, the composite volcano is the famous one because it is what we usually see in the movies. The cinder cone is the simplest one and the shield volcano is the largest among the three. The composite volcano is cone shaped volcano with a branched vent and a primary vent in the center"}, {"url": "http://www.universetoday.com/27333/types-of-volcanoes/", "passage_text": "There are 4 major types of volcanoes: Cinder Cone Volcanoes.

They are typically steep-sided, symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and bombs and may rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases. C inder cones are the simplest type of volcano. They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form a circular or oval cone."}, {"url": "http://www.geography.learnontheinternet.co.uk/topics/typesvolcanoes.html", "passage_text": "There are three main types of volcano-composite or strato, shield and dome. Composite Volcanoes. Composite volcanoes, sometimes known as strato volcanoes, are steep sided cones formed from layers of ash and [lava] flows. The eruptions from these volcanoes may be a pyroclastic flow rather than a flow of lava.
