Galvanizing involves coating corrosive metals, such as steel and iron, with a non-corrosive metal. The process of galvanizing, not only protects from corrosion of various \u2018soft metals\u2019 but also adds strength of the original, uncoated metal. Electro-Galvanizing: It is an electrolytic process for galvanizing, where a thinner, tighter bonding coat of zinc is applied to a metal through \u201celectroplating\u201d. 2  Electro plating is a process of running a current of electricity through a saline/ zinc solution with a zinc anode and steel conductor."}, {"url": "http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/galvanizing.html", "passage_text": "galvanizing. Process in which a zinc film is deposited on goods made of steel to provide long term (generally 10 to 30 years) corrosion protection and abrasion resistance.wo common galvanizing processes are (1) Hot metal bath: about 250 years old but still popular method in which the item is immersed in molten zinc to deposit a 50 to 150 micron thick film.
