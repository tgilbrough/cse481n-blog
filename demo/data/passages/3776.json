These include: 1  Excessive aqueous production. 2  The aqueous (or aqueous humor) is a clear fluid that is produced in the eye by the ciliary body, a structure located behind the iris. 3  The aqueous flows through the pupil and fills the anterior chamber of the eye, which is the space between the iris and the cornea. 1 If the aqueous drains too slowly from the eye, disrupting the normal balance of production and drainage of the eye's clear fluid, this too will cause high eye pressure. 2  Certain medications can have the side effect of causing ocular hypertension in certain individuals."}, {"url": "http://www.medicinenet.com/dry_eyes/page2.htm", "passage_text": "Dry eye syndrome is a common disorder of the normal tear film that results from decreased tear production, excessive tear evaporation, and an abnormality in the production of mucus or lipids normally found in the tear layer, or a combination of these. Aqueous (watery) tear deficiency is caused by either poor production of watery tears or excessive evaporation of the watery tear layer. Poor production of tears by the tear glands may be a result of age, hormonal changes, or various autoimmune diseases, such as primary Sjoegren'sj\u00f6gren s, syndrome rheumatoid, arthritis or. lupus"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_humour", "passage_text": "The aqueous humour is a transparent, gelatinous fluid similar to plasma, but containing low protein concentrations. It is secreted from the ciliary epithelium, a structure supporting the lens. It is located in the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye, the space between the lens and the cornea. Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy where retinal ganglion cells and their axons die causing a corresponding visual field defect. An important risk factor is increased intraocular pressure (pressure within the eye) either through increased production or decreased outflow of aqueous humour."}, {"url": "http://www.eyehealthweb.com/eye-pressure/", "passage_text": "Changes in eye pressure may be caused by: 1  Excessive or decreased aqueous production. 2  Inadequate or increased aqueous drainage. 3  Long-term use of certain medications, in particular corticosteroids. 4  Eye trauma.
