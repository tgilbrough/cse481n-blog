Bougainvillea is one of the showiest vines you can grow. The large plant practically smothers itself in big clusters of papery bracts. These bracts appear in bold shades of pink, lavender, red, gold, or orange and create a display you can see a block away. While bougainvillea is tropical, it's usually grown as an annual in cold-winter areas."}, {"url": "http://gardeningsolutions.ifas.ufl.edu/plants/ornamentals/bougainvillea.html", "passage_text": "Bougainvillea. Photo: Dan Culbert. Bougainvillea is a tropical vining shrub that comes in a wide array of bright and fanciful colors. The flowers are actually modified leaves, called bracts, that are long-lasting and bright. The colorful bracts outshine the plant's true (but tiny) flower, much like a poinsettia.

As a profuse bloomer, bougainvillea is most striking during the winter, when it is at its peak and few other plants are able to provide color. Bougainvillea are tropical and must be protected from frost. In Zone 8 and cooler, you are almost limited to growing them in some kind of container unless you treat them as an annual (plant a new plant outdoors each year).

If you want to keep bougainvillea outdoors all year long, it's best to be in hardiness zone 9 or higher. If you're in a colder, wetter zone, you can still grow bougainvillea if you plant it in a pot and bring it indoors for the winter. 1  Bougainvillea do best when night temperature don't drop below 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C) and daytime temperatures don't exceed 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C).
