An open-delta/open-wye is a method of providing a reduced-load three-phase supply using just two single-phase transformers, rather than the preferred method of using three single-phase transformers. Split and merge into it. Answer by Awaygood. Confidence votes 22.5K. There is no difference. A three-phase ' star ' connection is simply another name for a ' wye ' connection.

The 480/277v Y system is connected the same way: 480v line-to-line and 277v line-to-ground. Now, back to our as-of-yet ungrounded Delta system for a moment. There are two ways of grounding a Delta system. Question about difference between wye and delta.

This is also why the majority of 480 to 120/208 transformers are delta primary. A 6 lead motor that is connected wye for high voltage and delta for low is an exception to the above. These motors are dual-voltage, but the two voltages are not half or double like a 9 or 12 lead one. The high voltage is 1.73 X the low.

If you connect a wye wound motor as a delta -- well, I've never seen one that you could do that to. All of the wye wound motors I've seen are 9 lead or 3 lead. The 9 lead are dual voltage (usually 480/240) and the 3 lead are single voltage. Aside from Y-Start / Delta-Run motors, you ALWAYS only run 3 leads to the motor, NEVER the 4th (neutral). So how it is connected internally is for the motor mfr. to worry about, not you. In a Wye-Start / Delta Run motor, the windings, and associated power ratings, are still based on the Delta configuration."}]
