The R-value can be defined in simple terms as the resistance that any specific material offers to the heat flow. Figure 5.1 shows the thermal conductivities of R-11, dry air, water vapour and ice within an insulation material and illustrates the significant increase in thermal conductivity that can occur if air/gas is replaced by water vapour in the insulation."}, {"url": "http://dponline.org/weblog/2011/02/17/why-i-love-damart-but-wont-order-it-again/", "passage_text": "For years this was the only thermal underwear I\u2019d wear.

It is rated Grade 4 on the manufacturer's warmth scale, for use between -15C to -5C. Style and colour. In fact it's just about a perfect fit on me. My only gripe is that the sleeves are just a little on the short side.
