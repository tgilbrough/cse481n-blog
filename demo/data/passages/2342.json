The asteroid belt is located between the planets Mars and Jupiter. You can think of it as a belt between the rocky planets and the gas planets. These asteroids are called Near-Earth asteroids and they have orbits that cause them to pass close to the Earth. It is estimated that an asteroid larger than 10 feet across strikes the Earth around once a year."}, {"url": "http://www.kidsastronomy.com/asteroid.htm", "passage_text": "No picture currently available Ceres For many years Ceres was thought to be the biggest asteroid in the Solar System. It is about 600 miles wide and contains about 25% of the mass of all the asteroids combined. However, in the summer of 2001 scientists discovered an even bigger asteroid orbiting the Sun near Pluto. Due to their smaller size, asteroids do not have enough gravity to pull themselves into the shape of a ball. Astronomers group asteroids into different categories based on the way they reflect sunlight. The asteroid belt is divided into an inner belt and an outer belt."}, {"url": "http://easyscienceforkids.com/asteroid-belt-facts-video-for-kids/", "passage_text": "You will find out what the major differences asteroids have with planets, how many asteroids exist in our solar system and what an asteroid belt is.

Asteroids are essentially chunks of rock that measure in size from a few feet to several miles in diameter. (Small asteroids are called meteoroids.) The largest asteroid, Ceres, is about 590 miles (950 kilometers) wide. Like most asteroids, it lies in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Many astronomers believe the belt is primordial material that never glommed into a planet because of Jupiter's gravitational pull. Today, most asteroids orbit the sun in a tightly packed belt located between Mars and Jupiter. Comets are relegated to either a cloud or belt on the solar system fringe. Gravitational tugs, orbital collisions, and interstellar jostles occasionally perturb an asteroid or comet onto a wayward path."}, {"url": "http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/sciencefacts/space/asteroids.html", "passage_text": "Asteroid Facts for Kids.

Asteroids are also known as planetoids or minor planets. Asteroids vary greatly in size, some feature diameters as small as ten metres while others stretch out over hundreds of kilometres.

The asteroids in the asteroid belt come in a variety of sizes. Some are very small (less than a mile across), while others are quite large. The largest asteroid is called Ceres. It is about one-quarter the size of our moon.
