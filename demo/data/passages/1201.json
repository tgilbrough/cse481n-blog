The nucleus is arguably the most important organelle in the cell. It is the control center, telling all of the other organelles what to do and when to do it.

They act as the power plants of the cell, are surrounded by two membranes, and have their own genome. They also divide independently of the cell in which they reside, meaning mitochondrial replication is not coupled to cell division."}, {"url": "http://biologyfunfacts.weebly.com/cell-organelles.html", "passage_text": "Nucleus. The nucleus is one of the most important organelles in a cell. It is often the largest organelle in animal cells, but this is not always the case. Nuclei contain the genetic material called DNA that is responsible for controlling and directing all cell activities."}]
