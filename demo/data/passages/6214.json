Megabits per second (Mbps) refers to data transfer speeds as measured in megabits (Mb). This term is commonly used in communications and data technology to demonstrate the speed at which a transfer takes place. As noted earlier, one byte (B) is comprised of 8 bits (b). The distinction between megabytes in data storage and transfer contexts is the same as megabits and can lead to additional confusion. However, 1 megabyte per second (MBps) is equal to 8 Mbps (megabits per second)."}, {"url": "https://support.speedtest.net/hc/en-us/articles/203845230-What-do-mbps-and-kbps-mean-", "passage_text": "By default, Speedtest.net measures your connection speed in Mbps, meaning Megabits Per Second. Mbps is the ISP industry-standard, and we use it on Speedtest.net so you can easily compare your result to your broadband plan's speed.

The term Mbps is a unit of measurement that expresses broadband speed, or how fast data is transferred across a network. More specifically, it stands for megabits per second and should not be confused with megabytes per second, or MBps, a similar but completely separate measurement unit.

Dial-up access, on the other hand, requires a modem to initiate a 56 Kbps connection to the Internet. The FCC raised the minimum speed of broadband to 4 Mbps downstream, and 1 Mbps upstream. Broadband speed is measured in megabits per second, commonly stated as Mb or Mbps (i.e. 15Mb or 15 Mbps). The smallest unit of digital data is a bit.
