A large jar is big enough for a small species; a bigger snail will require an aquarium or a large plastic container. Do not simply throw away snail eggs, as they can hatch and spread live snails into local flora, wreaking havoc on native vegetation. Handle snails gently by picking them up by their shells, and do not attempt to pluck them from the sides of their aquarium, as this can cause injury."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail", "passage_text": "Snail is a common name that is applied most often to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs.

If you have a garden then chances are you have already seen them exploring this area as well. What you will discover is that snails species are quite abundant with thousands of them out there. Of course a snail can\u2019t move very far in a day but they do continually move most of the time to new locations. Snails are loners but they often come into contact with each other due to the feeding grounds where they find plenty for all of them to share.

In reality however, it is not always easy to say which species are terrestrial, because some are more or less amphibious between land and freshwater, and others are relatively amphibious between land and saltwater. The majority of land snails are pulmonates, i.e. they have a lung and breathe air. The lifespan of land snails varies from species to species. In the wild, Achatinidae snails live around 5 to 7 years and Helix snails live about 2 to 3 years. Many deaths are due to predators or parasites. In captivity, the lifespan of snails is much longer than in the wild, ranging from 10 to 15 years for many species."}]
