One of the first myopia loci to be mapped was on chromosome Xq28 (named MYP1) from a family with X-linked recessive form of myopia. The syndrome was later renamed as the Bornholm eye disease, and includes myopia, lazy eyes and red-green color blindness in its diagnosis."}, {"url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3340784/", "passage_text": "Abstract. Myopia is a significant public health problem and its prevalence is increasing over time and genetic factors in disease development are important. The prevalence and incidence of myopia within sampled population often varies with age, country, sex, race, ethnicity, occupation, environment, and other factors."}, {"url": "http://www.the-medical-dictionary.com/myopia_article_6.htm", "passage_text": "Myopia Myopia is a refractive defect of the eye in which light focuses in front of the retina. Those with myopia are often described as nearsighted or short-sighted in that they typically can see nearby objects clearly but distant objects appear blurred because the lens cannot flatten enough."}, {"url": "http://www.brighthub.com/science/genetics/articles/28906.aspx", "passage_text": "The Genetics of Myopia. written by: Grace Ibay\u2022edited by: Paul Arnold \u2022updated: 3/12/2009. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a condition in which the eye cannot focus on distant objects, and sometimes closer ones too. It is a common eye problem and one of the leading causes of vision loss around the world."}, {"url": "http://genetics.thetech.org/ask/ask73", "passage_text": "The genetics of poor eyesight are too complicated to be a simple dominant or recessive trait. Something like nearsightedness is probably made up of more than one disease and each disease probably has more than one gene involved! Poor eyesight definitely runs in families."}]
