Molecule on the surface of a pathogen that identifies it as a foreign invader to the immune system. Bacteria. Single-celled organism. Has a cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm. Lymphocyte. A type of white blood cell that make antibodies to fight off infections. Pathogen. A micro-organism that causes disease. Phagocyte.

Some white blood cells (B cells) recognize invaders, or antigens, directly. When a B cell recognizes and attaches to the antigen, it produces antibodies, which coat the surface of the virus or bacteria to stop it from multiplying or infecting other cells. This process is called neutralization. Other white blood cells (T cells) need help from cells that first ingest the invader and break it into fragments. The fragments are then presented to the T cells so that they can recognize and destroy them. These helper cells are called antigen presenting cells."}, {"url": "http://www2.estrellamountain.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/BioBookIMMUN.html", "passage_text": "Bone marrow contains tissue that produces lymphocytes.

White blood cells (WBCs), also called leukocytes or leucocytes, are the cells of the immune system that are involved in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders.

The \u201cB cells\u201d (so-called because they develop in bone marrow) produce antibodies. The \u201cT cells\u201d (so-called because they develop in a small organ called the thymus gland) are responsible for a variety of other immune responses.

White blood cells called lymphocytes originate in the bone marrow but migrate to parts of the lymphatic system such as the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus. There are two main types of lymphatic cells, T cells and B cells. Once activated, helper T cells start to divide and to produce proteins that activate B and T cells as well as other immune cells. The killer T cell is specialized in attacking cells of the body infected by viruses and sometimes also by bacteria. It can also attack cancer cells."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocyte", "passage_text": "This material is then displayed to other cells of the immune system. Some phagocytes then travel to the body's lymph nodes and display the material to white blood cells called lymphocytes.
