Its story has helped shape the nation's story. Battles and sieges were fought over it, royalty lived and died within its walls, and countless generations have been inspired by it. The military presence remains unbroken, but over the last 200 years the castle has become a national icon. It is now Scotland's leading tourist attraction, and a key element of the Edinburgh World Heritage Site."}, {"url": "http://www.edinburgharchitecture.co.uk/edinburgh-castle", "passage_text": "1 Nov 2013 \u2013 Edinburgh Castle has been voted the top UK Heritage Attraction in the prestigious 2013 British Travel Awards, the largest awards programme in the UK.

The majority of buildings in the castle are from the c17-c18th, when it was reborn as a military garrison."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Castle", "passage_text": "The most notable exceptions are St Margaret's Chapel from the early 12th century, which is regarded as the oldest building in Edinburgh, the Royal Palace and the early-16th-century Great Hall, although the interiors have been much altered from the mid-Victorian period onwards. In the early 15th century, another English invasion, this time under Henry IV, reached Edinburgh Castle and began a siege, but eventually withdrew due to lack of supplies.
