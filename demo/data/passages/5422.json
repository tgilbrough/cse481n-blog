Your physician may order a CRP test if he suspects you have an inflammatory disease such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, or to determine if anti-inflammatory medication is working."}, {"url": "http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=167&ContentID=c_reactive_protein_serum", "passage_text": "The C-reactive protein (CRP) test is used to find swelling and infection in your body. It does this by measuring the amount of CRP in your blood. CRP is a protein made by the liver and sent into the bloodstream. Blood levels may be higher when you have swelling (inflammation) or an infection."}, {"url": "http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART03424/Elevated-Creactive-Protein-CRP.html", "passage_text": "There are two tests for elevated C-reactive protein. One can show a non-specific elevation of CRP that occurs with general inflammatory changes in the body; the other test is hs-CRP-highly sensitive CRP-which is a measure of inflammation in blood vessels."}, {"url": "http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART03424/Elevated-Creactive-Protein-CRP.html", "passage_text": "CRP levels can be measured via a blood test. In evaluating cardiac risk, physicians look at a very narrow range of CRP levels, from zero to 3.0 and above. This requires a special test called high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), which may be able to reveal inflammation at the micro-vascular level."}, {"url": "http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART03424/Elevated-Creactive-Protein-CRP.html", "passage_text": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is a substance produced by the liver that increases in the presence of inflammation in the body. An elevated C-reactive protein level is identified with blood tests and is considered a non-specific marker for disease."}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/c-reactive-protein", "passage_text": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is a substance produced by the liver in response to inflammation. Other names for CRP are high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP), or ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein (US-CRP). A high level of CRP in the blood is a sign that there may be an inflammatory process occurring in the body."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/c-reactive-protein-crp", "passage_text": "A C-reactive protein (CRP) test is a blood test that measures the amount of a protein called C-reactive protein in your blood. C-reactive protein measures general levels of inflammation in your body. High levels of CRP are caused by infections and many long-term diseases. But a CRP test cannot show where the inflammation is located or what is causing it. Other tests are needed to find the cause and location of the inflammation."}]
