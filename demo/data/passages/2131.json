The fennec fox is the smallest fox in the world, weighing 2 to 3 pounds and the length is its body ranging from 9 to 16 inches.

They are small canine animals, with tiny bodies that are only about a foot to a foot and a half long. Their most amazing feature is the ears. The Fennec Fox has ears that are about six inches long. They look huge in comparison to the rest of their heads. The large ears help them to track their prey animals as well as being useful to help them to lower their body heat. The Fennec Fox weighs only about three pounds when full grown. Between the toes of the Fennec Vox there is thick hair and it helps them to move very quickly and very silently through the sandy surfaces they live in. The Fennec Fox is native to the drier regions of North Africa, in the Sanai and the Arabian Peninsula."}, {"url": "http://www.foxesandfriends.com/fennecfox.htm", "passage_text": "The Fennec or 'desert fox' is a fitting name for this little one. Vulpes is the Latin name for 'fox' and is the genus name for 'true foxes.' Some believe Fennecs are related to the Chihuahua, but this is untrue. Dogs contain more chromosomes than foxes, which makes it impossible for them to breed. Some people believe the Chihuahua was a relative of the Fennec, but they are more closely related to the modern day dog than a fox. The lower number of chromosomes in foxes - 39 in dogs vs. 32 in the Fennec-makes it impossible for the two species to breed and produce hybrids."}, {"url": "http://fennecfoxes.net/fennec-diet-and-health/", "passage_text": "Azmira: Their food is very natural and well-balanced for a fennec.
