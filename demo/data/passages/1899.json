The spine is made up of many vertebrae which are stacked upon one another, and in between each of these bones are discs. These discs are the spines shock absorbers. If it puts pressure on a spinal nerve, the herniated disk can cause pain, numbness or weakness in the back, legs or arms, depending on where the disk is located.
