Oxygen passes through the alveoli, into the capillaries and into the blood. It is carried to the heart and then pumped throughout the body to the tissues and organs. As oxygen is going into the bloodstream, carbon dioxide passes from the blood into the alveoli and then makes its journey out of the body.

Once it is in your lungs, air goes through a maze of smaller and smaller bronchial tubes until it reaches clusters of tiny sacs the alveoli. In appearance they are somewhat like bunches of grapes. The alveoli are the primary gas exchange units of the lung. Quite simply, they are the point where the gas-blood barrier is thin enough to permit rapid gas exchange."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_function_of_the_alveoli_system_of_your_lungs", "passage_text": "Alveoli are tiny sacs in the lungs that perform gas exchange.

They have supply of oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood surrounding their surface giving them a high blood supply. The deoxygenated blood from the right side of the Heart is carried to the Lungs.

These alveoli inflate and deflate with inhalation and exhalation. The behavior of the alveoli is largely dictated by LaPlace's law and surface tension.

It is estimated that the average, healthy adult has over 300 million alveoli. Alveoli are small sacs of tissues in each lung surrounded by capillaries and blood vessels. There is a thin cell layer between the sacs and the surrounding blood vessels. There is also a thin fluid that surrounds the alveoli sac. The fluid and thin cell wall allows air to pass through the cells and into the bloodstream.

The respiratory system consists of the nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchial tree, and the lungs. Its primary function is the basic exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
