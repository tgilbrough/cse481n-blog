Exterior insulation and finishing system (EIFS) is a general class of non-load bearing building cladding systems that provides exterior walls with an insulated, water-resistant, finished surface in an integrated composite material system. EIFS before 2000 was a barrier system, meaning the EIFS system itself was the weather barrier. After 2000 the EIFS industry introduced the air/moisture barrier that resides behind the foam."}, {"url": "http://allfinishconstruction.com/services/eifs", "passage_text": "There are two types of EIFS systems, barrier and drainable. Barrier, the earlier type, typically applied the insulating polystyrene board directly to the exterior sheathing with adhesive, followed by base coat, mesh and finish coat. There is no provision to deal with moisture that can be trapped if the system leaks. The most basic and common EIFS is called a barrier EIFS (also known as a traditional or conventional EIFS).

All EIFS are proprietary systems and the components of the system should not be modified beyond the limits stated in the manufacturer's literature.
