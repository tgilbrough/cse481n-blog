Pu-erh tea is made from the leaves and stems of the Camellia sinensis plant. This is the same plant that is used for making green, oolong, and black teas. Though the same source plant is used, the different teas are made by using different processes. The body breaks down the caffeine in pu-erh tea to get rid of it. Fluvoxamine (Luvox) can decrease how quickly the body breaks down caffeine. Taking pu-erh tea along with fluvoxamine (Luvox) might cause too much caffeine in the body, and increase the effects and side effects of caffeine."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu-erh_tea", "passage_text": "Pu-erh or Pu'er is a variety of aged dark tea produced in Yunnan province, China.

Pu-erh commonly comes in shaped forms, such as bricks, cakes (which are disc-shaped and also known as 'bing cha') and 'tuo cha' (which are shaped like tiny bowls). These shapes make the transport and storage of pu-erh convenient. If you don't like the flavor of pu-erh on its own, there are many pu-erh blends on the market. Chrysanthemum pu-erh is a traditional Chinese blend used for its 'cleansing' effects, but there are also more 'contemporary' tea blends available."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu-erh_tea", "passage_text": "The best known variety of this category of tea is Pu-erh from Yunnan Province, named after the trading post for dark tea during imperial China.
