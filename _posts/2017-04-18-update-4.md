### [](#header-3)Training Data

In an attempt to scope the baseline task into separate modules, we decided that initially, there are two models to build: 
1.   A model that can read in a question and either sort which passages are more relevant, or score the relevance of each passage.
2.   A model that is given a passage and a question, and can find the answer within the given passage.

For our initial experiments, we chose to only use samples where the answer can be found within a single passage, without having to synthesize the answer from multiple, and generate the language to express that answer. Afterall, there is no use generating an answer if the model does not know what to look for.

As mentioned in previous posts, we divided the MS MARCO dataset into 5 sets, for each of the 5 answer types. Therefore we can intially experiment with training separate models for each of the answer types before attemptting to use transfer learning or just using a single model for any question/answer sample.

For the baseline model discussed below, we chose to focus on the location answer type, since it generally fit our initial plan of finding answers that were verbatim within the passage, had a nice distribution of answer lengths, and was one of the smaller training subsets. 

Here is an example sample to give an idea of what the dataset looks like:

```json
{
  "passages": [
    ...
    {
      "is_selected": 0,
      "url": "http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/lung\/picture-of-the-lungs",
      "passage_text": "\u00a9 2014 WebMD, LLC. All rights reserved. The lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled organs located on either side of the chest (thorax). The trachea (windpipe) conducts inhaled air into the lungs through its tubular branches, called bronchi. The bronchi then divide into smaller and smaller branches (bronchioles), finally becoming microscopic. "
    },
    {
      "is_selected": 1,
      "url": "https:\/\/www.healthtap.com\/topics\/where-are-lungs-located-in-your-back",
      "passage_text": "1. Get help from a doctor now \u203a. under ribs: The lungs in the front and back are inside the rib cage. This is why doctors will place a stethoscope on the back as well as the front to evaluate the function of the lungs. ...Read more. 1 Where are your kidneys located on your back in women. 2  Where are the lungs located in the back. 3  Where are lungs located in your body. 4  Ask a doctor a question free online. 5  Where are the lungs located in the human body."
    },
    {
      "is_selected": 0,
      "url": "http:\/\/www.living-with-back-pain.org\/lungs-back-pain.html",
      "passage_text": "completely unrelated to the lungs. There are many possible causes of upper back pain, but the most common cause is muscle strain. Ligament and tendon strains and sprains may also occur in the upper back. Mechanical back pain or disc herniation is possible. There are also many possible causes of lung or breathing pain, which are not associated with your back or spine. Among these would be a collapsed lung, or an infection of some type, such as pneumonia or an abscess. You may also have pleuritis or pleurisy, an inflammation of the pleura that covers"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "query_id": 19704,
  "answers": [
    "Inside the rib cage."
  ],
  "query_type": "location",
  "query": "where are the lungs located in the back"
}
```

Making the strong assumption that we have the relevant passage (captured in the is_selected field of the training data) and that it contains the answer in it verbatim, we built our baseline model to find the answer within that passage.
