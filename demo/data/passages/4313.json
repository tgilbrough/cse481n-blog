Every integer (and its negation) is a divisor of itself. Every integer is a divisor of 0. Integers divisible by 2 are called even, and numbers not divisible by 2 are called odd. 1, \u22121, n and \u2212 n are known as the trivial divisors of n. A divisor of n that is not a trivial divisor is known as a non-trivial divisor. A non-zero integer with at least one non-trivial divisor is known as a composite number, while the units \u22121 and 1 and prime numbers have no non-trivial divisors. 1 7 is a divisor of 42 because, so we can say. 2  It can also be said that 42 is divisible by 7, 42 is a multiple of 7, 7 divides 42, or 7 is a factor of 42. 3  The non-trivial divisors of 6 are 2, \u22122, 3, \u22123. 4  The positive divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42."}, {"url": "https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/divisor.html", "passage_text": "Divisor. more ...
