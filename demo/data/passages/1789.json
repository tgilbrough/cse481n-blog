So, you would use between 143 - 200 gallons. If you take it easy on the pedal and drive on the slower side [60 -62 miles per hour] you should be able to average right at 7 MPG. The national average of fuel is 3.90 per gallon so using that average it would cost you between 557.00 - 780.00. ----- The U-Haul trucks use gasoline for all sizes, Penske and Budget uses diesel for the larger trucks so they get 7-9 miles per gallon.

Let\u2019s look at what this would mean for a 24-foot U-Haul rental truck, moving long distance from New York, NY to Dallas, TX (1,547 miles). With a 60 gallon gas tank and 6 MPG, you could expect to fill the loaded U-Haul up about four times along the way. According to the Rental Truck Fuel Calculator, with today\u2019s fuel prices, that comes to about $626 for fuel \u2013 or about $160 each time you stop. To put this into perspective, a Honda Pilot has a 19.5 gallon tank and averages 22 mpg, so you could go about 429 miles on a tank of gas. 384 Shares.
