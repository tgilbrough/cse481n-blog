Body Mass Index (BMI) provides an easy way to measure obesity, but more doctors are questioning its accuracy and usefulness. BMI is supposed to estimate the amount of body fat a person carries based on height and weight, and categorizes people based on what is appropriate for their size. BMI is not an accurate measurement of someone\u2019s health. People who might be considered overweight or obese according to their BMI, might be healthier than someone who under the BMI standards have a \u201cperfect weight\u201d."}, {"url": "http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2007/research-shows-bmi-often-not-an-accurate-indicator-of-body-fat/", "passage_text": "BMI is determined by this equation: A person\u2019s weight divided by his or her height squared. Generally a BMI of 25 or above indicates a person is overweight; 30 or above indicates obesity. A person with a higher BMI is thought to be at a greater risk of heart disease, diabetes and other weight-related problems."}, {"url": "http://healthland.time.com/2013/08/26/why-bmi-isnt-the-best-measure-for-weight-or-health/", "passage_text": "BMI readings under 18.5 mean you are underweight, and could put on a few pounds. If you fall between 18.5 and 24.9, you\u2019re considered normal, while a BMI of 30 or higher qualifies as overweight. But in recent years, more researchers argue that it\u2019s not the most accurate way to measure body weight. BMI is not an accurate measurement of someone\u2019s health.

For example, BMI doesn't distinguish between body fat and muscle mass, which weighs more than fat. Many NFL players have been labeled obese because of their high BMI, when they actually have a low percentage of body fat. The BMI is not always accurate in elderly adults, who have often lost muscle and bone mass. Although their BMI might be within a normal range, they could still be overweight."}, {"url": "http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265215.php", "passage_text": "Thus a 6ft-tall man should have a waist circumference of 36 inches or less, while a 5ft 4in woman's waist should not exceed 32 inches. The waist-to-height ratio should be considered as a screening tool, Ashwell added. Ashwell explained that BMI does not take into account the distribution of fat around the body. Abdominal fat affects organs like the kidney, liver and heart more severely than fat around the bottom or hips. Waist circumference gives an indication of abdominal fat levels.

The body mass index (BMI) formula uses height and weight to determine a person's amount of body fat. BMI classifies persons in four different weight ranges: underweight, normal, overweight and obese.
