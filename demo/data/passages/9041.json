They also play important roles in the embryo\u2019s nourishment, breathing, and seepage. The amnion is a thin but tough sac of membrane that covers an embryo. 1.Both the amnion and the chorion are extra embryonic membranes found in reptiles, birds and mammals. 2.The amnion is the inner membrane that surrounds the embryo while the chorion surrounds the embryo, the amnion and other membranes. 3.The amnion is filled with amniotic fluid, which holds the embryo in suspension while the chorion also acts as a protective barrier during the embryo\u2019s development. 4.The amnion comprises of tresodeum and ectoderm while the chorion includes the trophoblast and the mesoderm"}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/chorion-definition-function-quiz.html", "passage_text": "The essential function of the chorion is to develop the villi and the placenta that will provide a pathway for exchange from the mother to the fetus, making it a pivotal part of the pregnancy. Function of the Chorion. While a fetus is developing inside the mother, it is totally dependent on her for nutrition and removal of wastes. As the chorion develops, the side that is facing the fetus becomes the placenta."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/chorion-definition-function-quiz.html", "passage_text": "Definition of the Chorion. The chorion is a membrane that develops at the beginning of a pregnancy between the developing fetus and the mother and continues to grow throughout the pregnancy. The chorion is formed by two layers: embryonic mesoderm and a double layer of trophoblasts. Function of the Chorion. While a fetus is developing inside the mother, it is totally dependent on her for nutrition and removal of wastes. As the chorion develops, the side that is facing the fetus becomes the placenta."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorion", "passage_text": "For the chorion in vertebrate eggs, see Chorion (egg). For the entertainment company see Chorion (company). In humans and most mammals, the chorion is one of the membranes that exist during pregnancy between the developing fetus and mother. It is formed by extraembryonic mesoderm and the two layers of trophoblast that surround the embryo and other membranes.

The chorion is the outer membrane that encloses the embryo in reptiles, birds, and mammals. It is one of four fetal membranes which includes the allantois, amnion, chorion, and yolk sac. The function of the chorion is to contribute to the development of the placenta in placental mammals. The main function of the placenta is to move oxygenated blood into the bloodstream of the developing baby and in turn, move carbon dioxide out. It also ensures that nutrients are received, and wastes are taken away"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorion_(egg)", "passage_text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The chorion is the outermost membrane around the embryo in mammals, birds and reptiles. It develops from an outer fold on the surface of the yolk sac, which lies outside the vitteline envelope and is developed by the follicle cells while the egg is in the ovary. The chorion is one of the four extraembryonic membranes that make up the amniotic egg that provide for the nutrients and protection needed for the embryo's survival. It is located between the albumin, which is the white of the egg, and the eggshell. It encloses the embryo and the rest of the embryonic system"}]
