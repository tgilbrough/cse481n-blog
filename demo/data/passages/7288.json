Tremor, or shaking, often in a hand, arm, or leg, occurs when you're awake and sitting or standing still (resting tremor), and it gets better when you move that body part. Tremor is often the first symptom that people with Parkinson's disease or their family members notice. The most common cause of non-Parkinson's tremor is essential tremor. It's a treatable condition that is often wrongly diagnosed as Parkinson's. Besides tremor, the most common symptoms include: 1  Stiff muscles (rigidity) and aching muscles. 2  One of the most common early signs of Parkinson's is a reduced arm swing on one side when you walk. 3  This is caused by rigid muscles. 4  Rigidity can also affect the muscles of the legs, face, neck, or other parts of the body"}, {"url": "http://www.medicinenet.com/parkinsons_disease/article.htm", "passage_text": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and the most common movement disorder. It is characterized by progressive loss of muscle control, which leads to trembling of the limbs and head while at rest, stiffness, slowness, and impaired balance.

Tremor is often the first symptom that people with Parkinson's disease or their family members notice. At first the tremor may appear in just one arm or leg or only on one side of the body. The tremor also may affect the chin, lips, and tongue. As the disease progresses, the tremor may spread to both sides of the body. Symptoms of Parkinson's disease differ from person to person. They also change as the disease progresses. Symptoms that one person gets in the early stages of the disease, another person may not get until later-or not at all. Symptoms typically begin appearing between the ages of 50 and 60."}]
