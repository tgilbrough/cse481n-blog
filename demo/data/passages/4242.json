For example, a person's elbow joint is flexed when the hand is brought nearer to the shoulder. Flexion may be instigated by muscle contraction. A muscle that flexes a joint is called a flexor.

Flexion of the shoulder or hip refers to movement of the arm or leg forward. Extension is the opposite of flexion, describing a straightening movement that increases the angle between body parts. When a joint can move forward and backward, such as the neck and trunk, extension refers to movement in the posterior direction. For example, when standing up, the knees are extended. See also: List of flexors of the human body and List of extensors of the human body. Flexion and extension describe movements that affect the angle between two parts of the body. These terms come from the Latin words with the same meaning."}, {"url": "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flexion", "passage_text": "Medical Definition of FLEXION. 1. : a bending movement around a joint in a limb (as the knee or elbow) that decreases the angle between the bones of the limb at the joint\u2014compare extension 2. 3. : inflection 3. 4. a: a bending movement around a joint in a limb (as the knee or elbow) that decreases the angle between the bones of the limb at the joint \u2014 compare extension 3b b: a forward raising of the arm or leg by a movement at the shoulder or hip joint.
