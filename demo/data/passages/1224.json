The word ceramic is derived from a Greek word that means pottery, and describes any article made of natural clay hardened by heat. These two variables, clay and heat, determine an item\u2019s ceramic type.

This is known as the atomic scale structure. Most ceramics are made up of two or more elements.

A ceramic is an inorganic non-metallic solid made up of either metal or non-metal compounds that have been shaped and then hardened by heating to high temperatures. In general, they are hard, corrosion-resistant and brittle. Ceramic comes from the Greek word meaning \u2018pottery\u2019. "}, {"url": "http://depts.washington.edu/matseed/mse_resources/Webpage/Ceramics/ceramics.htm", "passage_text": "Ceramics are classified as inorganic and nonmetallic materials that are essential to our daily lifestyle. Ceramic and materials engineers are the people who design the processes in which these products can be made, create new types of ceramic products, and find different uses for ceramic products in everyday life. Ceramics are all around us. Ceramics are generally made by taking mixtures of clay, earthen elements, powders, and water and shaping them into desired forms. Once the ceramic has been shaped, it is fired in a high temperature oven known as a kiln. Often, ceramics are covered in decorative, waterproof, paint-like substances known as glazes."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic_art", "passage_text": "Ceramic art is art made from ceramic materials (including clay), which may take forms including art ware, tile, figurines, sculpture, and tableware. Ceramic art is one of the arts, particularly one of the visual arts, and of those, it is one of the plastic arts. While some ceramics are considered fine art, some are considered to be decorative, industrial or applied art objects. Ceramics may also be considered artifacts in archaeology"}, {"url": "http://pottery.about.com/od/meetingpotters/tp/pots101.htm", "passage_text": "All clay is a ceramic material, but there are other ceramic materials, as well. Glazes are also ceramic materials, because they permanently change during firing. Industrial ceramics include a range of materials such as silica carbide and zirconium oxide. "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic", "passage_text": "A ceramic is an inorganic, nonmetallic solid material comprising metal, nonmetal or metalloid atoms primarily held in ionic and covalent bonds. The crystallinity of ceramic materials ranges from highly oriented to semi-crystalline, and often completely amorphous (e.g., glasses). A ceramic material is an inorganic, non-metallic, often crystalline oxide, nitride or carbide material. Some elements, such as carbon or silicon, may be considered ceramics. Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, weak in shearing and tension."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic", "passage_text": "The word  ceramic comes from the Greek word \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (keramikos), of pottery or for pottery, from \u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (keramos), potter's clay, tile, pottery. The earliest known mention of the root ceram- is the Mycenaean Greek ke-ra-me-we, workers of ceramics, written in Linear B syllabic script.
