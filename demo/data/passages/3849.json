Totem poles serve many purposes beyond their beauty, and their meanings are as varied as the cultures that make them. Some totem poles represent stories or important events. On these poles, each figure on the totem represents part of a story. These totems are used as a way to record the history and legends of the tribes. Figures on a totem pole are not gods to be worshipped. Instead, they represent traits and characteristics each clan or story embodies. There are many other types of totem poles. Genealogy poles are erected in front of a family's home to represent the owner's clan or social status. Common figures found on totem poles include the raven (a symbol of The Creator), the eagle (representing peace and friendship), the killer whale (a symbol of strength), the thunderbird, the beaver, the bear, the wolf and the frog."}, {"url": "http://www.legendsofamerica.com/na-totems.html", "passage_text": "Animal Characteristics & Meaning.
