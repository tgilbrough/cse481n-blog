An endometrial thickness (EMT) of less than 7 mm decreases the pregnancy rate in in vitro fertilization by an odds ratio of approximately 0.4 compared to an EMT of over 7 mm. However, such low thickness rarely occurs, and any routine use of this parameter is regarded as not justified."}, {"url": "http://sogc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gui249CPG1010E.pdf", "passage_text": "INTRODUCTION I 1\u20133 Current ultrasound literature suggests that asymp-tomatic endometrial thickness of 8 to 11 mm in apostmenopausal women is not abnormal. 4\u20138 The measure-ment of the endometrium is made at its maximal thicknesson a midline sagittal image of the uterus obtained bytransvaginal ultrasound.

The inner lining of the uterus is called the endometrium. The endometrium is the tissue to which a fertilized egg, or blastocycst, attaches for the duration of a pregnancy. The endometrial size varies throughout the menstrual cycle, but should be less than 8 mm in post-menopausal women. Menstruation. The endometrium starts off as a thickened lining, sometimes measuring up to 15 mm in thickness. Menstruation occurs during the first week of the menstrual cycle. As the endometrium is expelled, it may vary in thickness and may have an irregular appearance on ultrasound."}]
