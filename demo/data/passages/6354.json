Two types of complex carbohydrates are particularly important for nutrition: 1  Starch: Starch is a polysaccharide that plants use to store energy. 2  Dietary Fiber: Dietary fiber is found in plants as cellulose, pectin, and lignin. Many foods contain carbohydrates: There are two types of carbohydrates, simple and complex. Most of your carbohydrates should come from complex carbohydrates. 1  One slice of bread: 15 grams. 2  1/4 bagel: 15 grams. 3  One cup raw leafy vegetables: 5 grams. 4  One medium apple or orange"}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/133227-what-are-3-types-carbohydrates/", "passage_text": "The three carbohydrates -- sugar, starch and fiber -- are all made from molecules of sugar. However, sugar also refers to a type of carbohydrate. Sugars, or simple carbohydrates, contain just one or two molecules of sugar. However, carbs alone aren't bad.

Their main role in the body is to store glucose. Raffinose and stachyose are the main types of oligosaccharides which consist of repetitive chains of fructose, galactose, and glucose. Let us take a look at all the types of carbohydrates and their functions. Simple carbohydrates have a 'simple' molecular structure and are made of 1 or 2 sugar molecules. Simple carbs can be digested very quickly due to their simple structures, and tend to elevate the blood sugar quickly."}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/design/foodtech/compositionpropertiesrev1.shtml", "passage_text": "Carbohydrates.

Simple is found in fruits and Veggies. Simple is broken down in 1 step to gluctose, which only provides a quick burst of \u2026 energy. Next is complex carbohydrates. Two types of carbohydrates, in sort of a high level grouping, can be broken down into simple and complex carbohydrates. Some simple carbohydrate are table sugar and glucose, w \u2026 hile more complex carbohydrates are something starchy, like pasta and other grain foods. Complex carbohydrates like starch are simply polymers of shorter monomer units like glucose.

Ideally, they come under oligosaccharides (since oligosaccharides contain two to ten sugar molecules).
