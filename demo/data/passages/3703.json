Over decades, chronic infection with hepatitis C damages the liver and can cause liver failure. Hepatitis C is one of several viruses that can cause hepatitis.

Hepatitis C is a disease caused by a virus that infects your liver. Your liver is an important organ in your body and has many functions. The liver removes harmful chemicals from your body, aids digestion, and processes vitamins and nutrients from food."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C", "passage_text": "It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. The virus persists in the liver in about 85% of those infected. This chronic infection can be treated with medication: the standard therapy is a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin, with either boceprevir or telaprevir added in some cases.
