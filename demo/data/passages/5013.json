Their students are great, they do their diploma with PIP as a client, and we really learn from them. They have some surprising ideas on how to get through to people, which we need, they wrote press release and produced posters. Some of them even turned up to the screening in a really bad weather. Politics is not possible beyond the embodied experience. It is always subjective and always situated in a particular context. Therefore I will never stop being a Pole exploring Plumstead as some terra incognita which opens through a physical contact or some content analysis of the local maps and images."}]
