Another name is equilateral quadrilateral, since equilateral means that all of its sides are equal in length. Etymology [edit]. The word rhombus comes from Greek \u1fe5\u03cc\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 (rhombos), meaning something that spins, which derives from the verb \u03c1\u03ad\u03bc\u03b2\u03c9 (rhemb\u014d), meaning to turn round and round.

Sometimes, the term quadrangle is used, by analogy with triangle, and sometimes tetragon for consistency with pentagon (5-sided), hexagon (6-sided) and so on. 1 An equivalent condition is that opposite sides are parallel (a square is a parallelogram), that the diagonals perpendicularly bisect each other, and are of equal length. 2  A quadrilateral is a square if and only if it is both a rhombus and a rectangle (four equal sides and four equal angles)."}, {"url": "http://www.symbols.com/symbol/1813", "passage_text": "Rhombus.
