Many doctors think it should be lower. About 50-70 beats per minute is ideal, says Suzanne Steinbaum, MD, director of women's heart health at Lenox Hill Hospital.

For children ages 6 to 15, the normal resting heart rate is between 70 and 100 bpm, according to the AHA. Heart rate, also known as pulse, is the number of times a person's heart beats per minute. A normal heart rate depends on the individual, age, body size, heart conditions, whether the person is sitting or moving, medication use and even air temperature. Even emotions can have an impact on heart rate."}, {"url": "https://www.sharecare.com/health/circulatory-system-health/what-is-normal-heart-rate", "passage_text": "The heart normally beats about 60 to 80 times every minute when a person is at rest. This is called the heart rate. In some people, the heart rate may be even less than 60 beats per minute (bpm), and this is perfectly safe as long as they feel well, have normal blood pressure and their heart speeds up with exercise. Olympic athletes commonly have heart rates of 30 to 40 bpm. For adults, a normal resting rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. Athletes may have a rate as low as 40 bpm because their hearts are trained to efficiently pump blood. If your heart rate is consistently below 60 or above 100, you may have a heart condition, such as arrhythmia."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_should_a_normal_pulse_rate_be", "passage_text": "Answer by Answers Publisher.

The fitter you are, the lower your resting heart rate is likely to be. For example, athletes may have a resting heart rate of 40-60 bpm or lower. You should contact your GP if you think your heart rate is continuously above 120 bpm or below 40 bpm, although this could just be normal for you."}, {"url": "http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/heart-rate/faq-20057979", "passage_text": "A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute. Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. For example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats a minute. To measure your heart rate, simply check your pulse. Place your index and third fingers on your neck to the side of your windpipe. Consult your doctor if your resting heart rate is consistently above 100 beats a minute (tachycardia) or if you're not a trained athlete and your resting heart rate is below 60 beats a minute (bradycardia) \u2014 especially if you have other signs or symptoms, such as fainting, dizziness or shortness of breath.

People who are very physically fit often have slightly lower resting heart rates. Also, heart rate, much like weight, tends to increase with age. For adults, a normal resting rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. Athletes may have a rate as low as 40 bpm because their hearts are trained to efficiently pump blood.

Your heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times your heart beats per minute. Normal heart rate varies from person to person. Knowing yours can be an important heart-health gauge. If you\u2019re sitting or lying and you\u2019re calm, relaxed and aren\u2019t ill, your heart rate is normally between 60 (beats per minute) and 100 (beats per minute), Stein said. But a heart rate lower than 60 doesn\u2019t necessarily signal a medical problem. It could be the result of taking a drug such as a beta blocker."}]
