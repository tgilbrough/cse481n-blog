It does not occur uncombined in nature but occurs chiefly as the oxide (silica) and as silicates. What makes silicon, and other semiconductors, special is that it is possible to promote one of the electrons to an empty board-the conduction band-where they can move freely. It's a bit like the 3-dimensional chess played by the point-eared Dr Spock in Star Trek.

These are silicon-oxygen polymers with methyl groups attached. Silicone oil is a lubricant and is added to some cosmetics and hair conditioners.

Silicon is also part of the the carbon family. Other carbon family elements include carbon, germanium, tin, and lead. Silicon is a metalloid, one of only a very few elements that have characteristics of both metals and non-metals. Silicon is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, exceeded only by oxygen. Many rocks and minerals contain silicon. Silicon never occurs as a free element in nature. It always occurs as a compound with oxygen, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, or other elements. The most common minerals are those that contain silicon dioxide in one form or another."}, {"url": "http://chemistry.about.com/od/elementfacts/a/silicon.htm", "passage_text": "Silica is used to make glass, which has many useful mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal properties. Sources: Silicon makes up 25.7% of the earth's crust, by weight, making it the second most abundant element (exceeded by oxygen). Silicon is found in the sun and stars. Uses: Silicon is one of the most widely used elements. Silicon is important to plant and animal life. Diatoms extract silica from water to build their cell walls.
