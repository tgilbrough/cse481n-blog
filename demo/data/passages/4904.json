Figure 4 shows the major cartilaginous and ligamentous structures which make up the larynx. The PHARYNX is a fibromuscular tube which extends from the base of the skull to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage (at which point it becomes the esophagus). Portions of the pharynx lie posterior to the nasal cavity (nasal pharynx), oral cavity (oral pharynx) and larynx (laryngeal pharynx)."}, {"url": "http://rrespiratorysystemm.weebly.com/major-organs-and-tissues.html", "passage_text": "major tissues.
