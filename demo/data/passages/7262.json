Like most plant-based products, palm oil contains very little cholesterol. Palm oil is a common cooking ingredient in the tropical belt of Africa, Southeast Asia and parts of Brazil. Its use in the commercial food industry in other parts of the world is widespread because of its lower cost and the high oxidative stability (saturation) of the refined product when used for frying. Palm oil, like all fats, is composed of fatty acids, esterified with glycerol. Palm oil has an especially high concentration of saturated fat, specifically, of the 16-carbon saturated fatty acid palmitic acid, to which it gives its name. Monounsaturated oleic acid is also a major constituent of palm oil."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-1139-PALM%20OIL.aspx?activeIngredientId=1139&activeIngredientName=PALM%20OIL", "passage_text": "Palm oil is obtained from the fruit of the oil palm tree.

Demand for palm oil is growing-and fast. At the moment, most of it ends up in hundreds of food products-from margarine and chocolate to cream cheese and oven chips-although it's also used in cosmetics and increasingly, for use in biodiesel."}]
