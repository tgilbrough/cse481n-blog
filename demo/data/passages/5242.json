There is no standard size but I would keep it in even lengths, if you are thinking about PVC or PVC encapsulated or strait composite I would stay with 12', 16', or 20'. That's the length they are made and to cut off a foot or two just because your deck is a different size can get pricy. Most of the new products cost between a low of 2 dollars a foot to almost 4 dollars a foot. Those pcs in the scrap pile will add up to some big bucks.

It includes thirteen ranks of each of the four French suits, clubs (\u2663), diamonds (\u2666), hearts (\u2665) and spades (\u2660), with reversible court or face cards. Some modern designs, however, have done away with reversible face cards. The weight of an average B8-sized playing card is 0.063 ounces (1.8 g), and a 52 card deck 3.3 ounces (94 g).

The average deck size is between 300 and 400 square feet. Generally, a deck should be wider than it is deep, with the longer dimension running along the house.

But 14 is the starting point where there is plenty of room around a table. So a 14 deck becomes a good buy. Deck proportions, we prefer decks to have good proportions, generally wider then deep looks better, so a 18 x14 or even 16 x14 with the bigger size being along the house and the smaller size projecting into the rear yard looks proper and is a good deck size in general."}, {"url": "http://ths.gardenweb.com/discussions/2530239/deck-standard-size", "passage_text": "Is there such a thing as standard size decks or acceptable spanning of the back of the home?
