Bananas, sour cherries, apricots and peaches are alkaline fruits. These fruits help to remove hydrogen ions from your body, making the foods alkalizing. Tomatoes, avocados, currants and pears are also nonacidic fruits. Many vegetables are alkalizing. Red cabbage, spinach, cayenne pepper, zucchini and fresh cucumbers are nonacidic foods that can help to balance low pH levels. Lemons taste acidic, but the fruit yields an alkalizing effect after being digested. As your body assimilates the citrus fruit, the end product carries an alkaline pH level. Limes, oranges and grapefruit are other nonacidic citrus fruits which are high on the pH scale"}, {"url": "http://www.rense.com/1.mpicons/acidalka.htm", "passage_text": "The pH scale is from 0 to 14, with numbers below 7 acidic (low on oxygen) and numbers above 7 alkaline.
