[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofibril", "passage_text": "A myofibril (also known as a muscle fibril) is a basic rod-like unit of a muscle cell. Muscles are composed of tubular cells called myocytes, known as muscle fibers in striated muscle, and these cells in turn contain many chains of myofibrils. The filaments of myofibrils, myofilaments, consist of two types, thick and thin: 1  Thin filaments consist primarily of the protein actin, coiled with nebulin filaments. 2  Actin, when polymerized into filaments, forms the ladder along which the myosin filaments climb to generate motion"}, {"url": "http://anatomycorner.com/muscles/notes_muscles.html", "passage_text": "There are two types: MYOSIN-thick filaments ACTIN-thin filaments. Structure of a SARCOMERE (functional unit of a muscle). Actin and Myosin filaments are arranged in an overlapping pattern of light (I bands) and dark (A bands).
