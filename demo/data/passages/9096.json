With all muscles of the jaw working together it can close the teeth with a force as great as 55 pounds (25 kilograms) on the incisors or 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms) on the molars. Muscles of the Uterus The uterus sits in the lower pelvic region. It's not the tongue, it's made up of group of 16 muscles, and while it's a cool little thing it's not the strongest in any category. The strongest muscle depends on what you mean by strongest, for pure force generation it's the gluteus maximus, simply because it is the largest muscle in the body. Meaning, if you were to dissect any muscle from the body, the gluteus maximus would lift the most weight"}, {"url": "http://zidbits.com/2011/02/what-is-the-strongest-muscle-in-your-body/", "passage_text": "The largest muscle in the human body is the gluteus maximus.

At the time when an infant is delivered, the human uterus weighs about 40 oz (1.1 kg). During childbirth, the uterus exerts 25 to 100 lbf (100 to 400 N) of downward force with each contraction. From a medical point of view the muscle usually quoted as being the strongest in the body is the masseter, the muscle which closes your jaw (it's the one that sticks out the side of your jaw when you clench your teeth). I have no idea why so many people on here have said tongue but that is complete nonsense."}]
