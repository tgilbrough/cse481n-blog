Asphalt emulsion is a combination of three basic ingredients; asphalt, water, and small amounts of emulsifying agent. In the same process, these components are introduced into a mechanism known as a colloid mill, which shears the asphalt into tiny droplets. Asphalt emulsions are used in cold processes for road construction and maintenance. Emulsions are classified on the basis of how quickly the asphalt droplets will re-coalesce (break and setup). The terms rapid set (RS), medium set (MS), quick set (QS) and slow set (SS) have been adopted to classify the emulsions."}, {"url": "http://bitumina.co.uk/bitumen-emulsions.html", "passage_text": "In the production of bitumen emulsion, water is treated with an emulsifying agent and other chemicals and is pumped to a colloid mill along with bitumen.

The bitumen droplets range from 0.1\u201320 micron in diameter. USE OF ASPHALT EMULSION The first asphalt (bitumen) emulsions used in road construction were prepared in the early part of the 20th century. Today approximately 3 million tons of emulsions are produced in the United States representing about 5% to 10% of asphalt consumption."}]
