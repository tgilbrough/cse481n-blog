Chemical sedimentary rocks are a different type of sedimentary rock because they are not made up of weathered sediment grains; instead they are composed of mineral crystals that form out of solution. In other words, chemical sedimentary rocks contain crystals and other elements that have been dissolved out of water."}, {"url": "http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/geology/sed_chemical.html", "passage_text": "Unlike most other sedimentary rocks, chemical rocks are not made of pieces of sediment. Instead, they have mineral crystals made from elements that are dissolved in water. The water in the oceans, lakes, and ground is often full of dissolved elements."}, {"url": "http://ratw.asu.edu/aboutrocks_chemicalsedimentary.html", "passage_text": "Chemical Sedimentary Rocks. Chemical sedimentary rocks form by precipitation of minerals from water. Precipitation is when dissolved materials come out of water. For example: Take a glass of water and pour some salt (halite) into it. The salt will dissolve into the water."}, {"url": "http://thisoldearth.net/Sedimentary-Rocks-chemical.html", "passage_text": "Chemical and Biochemical Sedimentary Rocks. Chemical sedimentary rock is formed when minerals, dissolved in water, begin to precipitate out of solution and deposit at the base of the water body."}, {"url": "http://homepage.smc.edu/grippo_alessandro/rockssedimentary.html", "passage_text": "Clastic sedimentary rocks form when individual grains (the sediment), made by fragments of rocks, minerals, or shells, are cemented together (the clastic sediemntary rock). These are the only type of rock that is NOT made simply of crystals, but rather fragments of other materials, broken and then reassembled together."}, {"url": "http://homepage.smc.edu/grippo_alessandro/rockssedimentary.html", "passage_text": "Sedimentary rocks form from sediment. Sediment is a general term that indicates loose grains (such as the sand at the beach) and chemical precipitates (such as crystals of salt). Sedimentary rocks can be subdivided in three categories: clastic, chemical, and biochemical sedimentary rocks."}]
