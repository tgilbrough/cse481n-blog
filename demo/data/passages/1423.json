Degrees of latitude are parallel so the distance between each degree remains almost constant but since degrees of longitude are farthest apart at the equator and converge at the poles, their distance varies greatly. Each degree of latitude is approximately 69 miles (111 kilometers) apart. The range varies (due to the earth's slightly ellipsoid shape) from 68.703 miles (110.567 km) at the equator to 69.407 (111.699 km) at the poles. This is convenient because each minute (1/60th of a degree) is approximately one mile. A degree of longitude is widest at the equator at 69.172 miles (111.321) and gradually shrinks to zero at the poles. At 40\u00b0 north or south the distance between a degree of longitude is 53 miles (85 km).

Well, there's 360 degrees in a circle, so if we divide 24,901.92 miles by 360 degrees, we get 69.172 miles per degree! How's that! And furthermore, the distance between two lines of latitude, from 0 degrees to 1 degree north, is also 69.2 miles-because it's also 1/360th of the circumference of the earth! . You take my breath away, Lou! At the equator, the distance between 15 and 30 degrees W longitude is quite a lot! But as you follow those two longitude lines towards the poles, the distance between them shrinks down to zero!
