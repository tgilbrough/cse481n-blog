Bromine is a member of the halogen family. Halogens are the elements that make up Group 17 (VIIA) of the periodic table. The periodic table is a chart that shows how elements are related to one another. The halogens are also known as the salt formers. Bromine is too reactive to exist as a free element in nature. Instead, it occurs in compounds, the most common of which are sodium bromide (NaBr) and potassium bromide (KBr). These compounds are found in seawater and underground salt beds. These salt beds were formed in regions where oceans once covered the land."}, {"url": "http://www.chemistryexplained.com/elements/A-C/Bromine.html", "passage_text": "Bromine is a very reactive element. While it is less reactive than fluorine or chlorine, it is more reactive than iodine. It reacts with many metals, sometimes very vigorously. For instance, with potassium, it reacts explosively.

One of the very cool physical properties of bromine is that it is the only nonmetallic element that is a liquid at room temperature. Don't let that cool trait overwhelm you. Bromine is a very dangerous chemical, purified or in gas form. Bromine is a member of the halogen family of elements. When you think of bromine, think reddish-brown. Gases with bromine atoms often have a dirty color, they smell bad, and they might make your skin and nose irritated. The name bromine is even based on the Greek word bromos that means something that smells bad."}]
