Drinking too much water can lead to a condition known as water intoxication and to a related problem resulting from the dilution of sodium in the body, hyponatremia. Water intoxication is most commonly seen in infants under six months of age and sometimes in athletes. A baby can get water intoxication as a result of drinking several bottles of water a day or from drinking infant formula that has been diluted too much. Athletes can also suffer from water intoxication."}, {"url": "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6263029.stm", "passage_text": "If you drink too much water it lowers the concentration of salt in your blood so that it is lower than the concentration of salt in cells, says Professor Robert Forrest, a consultant in clinical chemistry and forensic toxicology at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield. If you are going to the toilet more than once every two hours or so that might be too much, especially if your urine is clear, she says, but adds that drinking too much water is unusual.

The condition occurs when you drink too much water too quickly, placing stress on your kidneys. Your kidneys normally filter water and waste from your body. When you drink too much water, your kidneys cannot perform swiftly enough. Water builds up in your body, diluting the electrolytes in your blood.

It will mess with the electrolytes in your blood and make your body less likely to work properly. This is similar to when you are dehydrated which is why you drink electrolyte fluid(Gatorade, etc) to replace electrolytes lost through sweating. If you dilute the blood too much, the brain and muscles can fail, resulting in coma or heart attack and death. Several people have died from water-drinking contests. Normally this is very difficult to do: an adult usually has to drink 1-2 gallons of pure water for symptoms to occur."}, {"url": "http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=2047", "passage_text": "Answer 1: You can drink too much water, but it's difficult to do.
