As an adult worm it lives in the heart and blood vessels that supply the lungs in dogs and foxes. The symptoms you may see in your dog are due to where the worm chooses to live its adult life. As a juvenile worm they complete their life cycles in slugs and snails. Lungworm is what we call an \u2018emerging\u2019 disease.
