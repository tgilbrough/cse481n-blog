Asteroids are essentially chunks of rock that measure in size from a few feet to several miles in diameter. (Small asteroids are called meteoroids.) The largest asteroid, Ceres, is about 590 miles (950 kilometers) wide. Like most asteroids, it lies in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Many astronomers believe the belt is primordial material that never glommed into a planet because of Jupiter's gravitational pull.

Asteroids are the leftover debris from the creation of our solar system. 2.) Sometimes a collision in the asteroid belt can send a large rock hurling towards earth.

In many cases, they contain the original material that formed the solar system. The surface material of the Earth and Moon, by contrast, has greatly changed over time.
