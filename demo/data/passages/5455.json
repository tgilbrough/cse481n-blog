Human language is dauntingly complex for a computer to understand. Think about the following two sentences: \u201cMary had a little lamb and drove her car to a farm. That is what the Center for Natural Language Processing in the Syracuse University iSchool works with, developing systems that derive meaningful information from human language for computers."}, {"url": "http://blog.mashape.com/list-of-25-natural-language-processing-apis/", "passage_text": "Note: Check out our latest API collections page for the list of updated APIs. Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. A service for automatic proofreading of multilingual texts. This API uses multilingual Natural Language Processing technology to check the spelling, grammar and style of your texts with high accuracy, in order to provide precise and up-to-date suggestions and educational explanations based on references."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "passage_text": "For the processing of language by the human brain, see Language processing in the brain. Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of human\u2013computer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve natural language understanding, that is, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input, and others involve natural language generation.

One approach tries to use all the information in a sentence, as a human would, with the goal of making the computer able to process to the degree that it could converse with a human. In discussions of natural language processing by computers, it is just presupposed that machine level processing is going on as the language processing occurs, and it is not considered as a topic in natural language processing per se."}, {"url": "http://www.mind.ilstu.edu/curriculum/protothinker/natural_language_processing.php", "passage_text": "The result of a human person processing a sentence in a natural language is that the person understands the meaning of the sentence. We ignore consideration of whether a book, a play, or some other story or narrative has a single meaning intended by the author that is the meaning.
