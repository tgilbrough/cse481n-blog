They can be fairly large in size. Active during daylight, they are frequently seen moving on the ground, and occasionally up in bushes. Northern and Southern Alligator lizards are very similar in appearance, but observing the color of the eye and the position of the dark stripes on the belly can help you differentiate them.

They do need warmer climates when possible as they are cold blooded. However, when it is cooler they are able to slow down their body functions and to survive. When it comes to Lizards in captivity is important to identify the type of habitat that they would normally be associated with in the wild. Keeping their environment warm enough is crucial. However, a heat light should only be on one side of their cage or aquarium."}, {"url": "http://www.californiaherps.com/identification/lizardsid/elgaria.id.html", "passage_text": "Three species of Alligator Lizards can be found in California: The Southern Alligator Lizard-Elgaria multicarinata (found throughout the state).
