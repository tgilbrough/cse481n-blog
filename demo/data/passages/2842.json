The resulting mRNA is a single-stranded copy of the gene, which next must be translated into a protein molecule.

Transcription takes place in two broad steps. First, pre-messenger RNA is formed, with the involvement of RNA polymerase enzymes. The pre-messenger RNA thus formed contains introns which are not required for protein synthesis. The pre-messenger RNA is chopped up to remove the introns and create messenger RNA (mRNA) in a process called RNA splicing (Figure 5)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression", "passage_text": "The production of RNA copies of the DNA is called transcription, and is performed in the nucleus by RNA polymerase, which adds one RNA nucleotide at a time to a growing RNA strand.
