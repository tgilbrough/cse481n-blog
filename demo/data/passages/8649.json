But it does interact with magnets and that's pretty important. If you have a strong enough magnetic field all matter is magnetic. But copper is so weakly magnetic that we can't observe it without very, very large magnetic fields. So the short answer is No, copper isn t magnetic.."}, {"url": "http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~wbreslyn/chemistry/is-copper-magnetic.html", "passage_text": "When a magnet moves near copper (or other metals) it sets up electrical eddy currents. The eddy currents will repel the magnet as it falls down the copper tube. This repulsion pushes against the magnet and slows it down. In the video you can see that the magnet appears to float through the tube. If you have a strong enough magnetic field all matter is magnetic.
