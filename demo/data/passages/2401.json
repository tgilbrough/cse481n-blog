It occurs in basically all mineral environment s, and is the important constituent of many rock s. Quartz is also the most varied of all minerals, occurring in all different forms, habits, and colors. There are more variety names given to Quartz than any other mineral. - The blue variety of Quartz, which is very uncommon in nature and rarely in crystal form. Most Blue Quartz is what is popularly known as Aqua Aura, essentially clear Rock Crystal synthetically irradiated with gold to form a deep sky blue color."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandstone", "passage_text": "Sandstone (sometimes known as arenite) is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized minerals or rock grains. Most sandstone is composed of quartz and/or feldspar because these are the most common minerals in the Earth's crust. Like sand, sandstone may be any color, but the most common colors are: tan, brown, yellow, red, grey, pink, white, and black.
