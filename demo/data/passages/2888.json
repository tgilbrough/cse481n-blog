Carbohydrate is a major nutrient that includes sugars, starches and fiber. Digestible carbohydrate is an energy source for all your cells, while indigestible fiber provides other benefits. Your digestive tract produces an enzyme called amylase that breaks down sugars and starches into glucose, which travels in your blood to reach your cells. Categories.
