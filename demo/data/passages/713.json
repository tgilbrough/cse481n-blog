[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meristem", "passage_text": "A meristem is the tissue in most plants containing undifferentiated cells (meristematic cells), found in zones of the plant where growth can take place. Meristematic cells give rise to various organs of the plant and keep the plant growing. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) gives rise to organs like the leaves and flowers, while the root apical meristem (RAM) provides the meristematic cells for the future root growth."}, {"url": "http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Meristematic+cell", "passage_text": "In one type of lateral meristem, called cambium, or vascular cambium, the cells divide and differentiate to form the conducting tissues of the plant, i.e., the wood wood,botanically, the xylem tissue that forms the bulk of the stem of a woody plant."}, {"url": "http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/meristem", "passage_text": "In one type of lateral meristem, called cambium, or vascular cambium, the cells divide and differentiate to form the conducting tissues of the plant, i.e., the wood wood,botanically, the xylem tissue that forms the bulk of the stem of a woody plant."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meristem", "passage_text": "In general, differentiated plant cells cannot divide or produce cells of a different type. Therefore, cell division in the meristem is required to provide new cells for expansion and differentiation of tissues and initiation of new organs, providing the basic structure of the plant body."}, {"url": "http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/meristem", "passage_text": "meristem. (m\u0115r`ist\u0115m') , a specialized section of plant tissue characterized by cell division and growth. Much of the mature plant's growth is provided by meristems. Apical meristems found at the tips of stems and roots increase the length of these sections."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071021233343AA9HEOi", "passage_text": "Best Answer: Meristematic tissue is just tissue that is capable of dividing. It can be found at the growing tips (roots and stems), at the base of some leaves, in the stems of woody plants (where it is called a cambium instead of a meristem), and a few other places."}, {"url": "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/meristematic", "passage_text": "The cells of the meristem are not specialized but can become specialized to form the tissues of roots, leaves, and other plant parts. The growing tips of roots and stems and the tissue layer known as cambium are part of a plant's meristem."}, {"url": "http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/science/meristem.html", "passage_text": "Tissues derived from differentiated lateral meristem are known as secondary tissues. In one type of lateral meristem, called cambium, or vascular cambium, the cells divide and differentiate to form the conducting tissues of the plant, i.e., the wood, or xylem, and the phloem (see bark; stem). The growth in diameter of tree trunks is wholly dependent on the division of cambium cells."}]
