This is due to the Peukert Effect. For example, if 50 amp hours has been consumed from a 100 amp hour battery, then you do not want to recharge it at rate any greater than 25 amps in one hour. At a 25 amp charging rate, it should take approximately two hours to get to a 80% State-of-Charge."}, {"url": "http://www.aussiebatteries.com.au/blog/charging-deep-cycle-batteries/", "passage_text": "The charging time for deep cycle batteries depends on the number of amp hours it stores. Divide the amp hour rating of your battery by the amp rating of the charger and you\u2019ll have an estimate of the time needed to reach full charge.

How much current a battery can delivery starting a car is called cold cranking amps. A deep cycle marine battery will typically be more than 40Ah. A 40Ah car battery at 50% charge will more than likely start your car in fair weather. Cold weather is another story. So, to get a completely dead car battery to 50% - 20Ah-would be maybe two days of full sunlight-with only a 50% charge, or about 12.2 Volts. Watts = volts x amps a 12volt battery needs an incoming current of at least 13 volts to charge it; 13.5 volts is better. so if the output VOLTAGE of the panel is less than 13 volts it wont do anything.

But if you had discharged the battery say 60% used, leaving 40% in the battery, It would charge at 10 Amps for 4-5 hours. but as it reaches 85% most Automatic chargers cut back to 2 amps or so and take several hours to top up. At that point it will shutoff or stay at the trickle rate. Check the spec. on your charger"}, {"url": "http://forums.iboats.com/forum/general-boating-outdoors-activities/boat-topics-and-questions-not-engine-topics/20117-how-long-does-a-deep-cycle-battery-take-to-charge", "passage_text": "This is only if I only used about 60% of the capacity. If all the capacity is used and the battery has no life, it will take about 48 hours at the 2 amp rate. I could charge my deep cycle faster on a higher setting but from experience, the higher rate after prolong useage, the life expectancy drops. If you slow charge (about 2 amperhours) you will not cook the plates that are inside the battery. Depending on the deep cycle rate of the battery will depend on how long you will achive a full charge. With the battery that I have, it will take about 24 hours to charge on the 2 amp setting."}, {"url": "http://www.bassresource.com/bass-fishing-forums/topic/125007-charging-deep-cycle-marine-battery/", "passage_text": "Posted. When you hear all this stuff about how you should slow charge a deep cycle battery, remember the manufacturers considers 10% of the battery capacity a SLOW charge. So, a 100 Ah battery would be charged at 10 amps. The two amp setting is for your lawn mower size batteries, not a TM battery. As mentioned above, to fully charge a deep cycle battery, it requires being over charged by 6%, Your standard hot box as I call them automatic chargers will not do this. Most of them will actually cut off before it's reaches 100% much less over charge it the necessary 6%."}]
