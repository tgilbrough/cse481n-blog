Optical isomerism is characteristic of organic molecules that do not have a plane of symmetry (a plane dividing the molecule into two mirror images) and are not coincident with its mirror image (that is, with a molecule corresponding to the mirror image).

The Importance of Isomerism. As previously mentioned, isomers of the same molecule have the potential to have different physical or chemical properties. These differences can have some important implications. Functional Isomers. Also referred to as functional group isomers, these are isomers where the molecular formula remains the same, but the type of functional group in the atom is changed. This is possible by rearranging the atoms within the molecule so that they\u2019re bonded together in different ways."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_isomer", "passage_text": "Conversely, an achiral object, such as an atom, is symmetric; its mirror image is not truly opposite, but rather is indistinguishable from the original. In chemistry, chirality usually refers to molecules. Two mirror images of a chiral molecule are called enantiomers or optical isomers. Pairs of enantiomers are often designated as  right-  and left-handed. A molecule is achiral (not chiral) when an improper rotation, that is a combination of a rotation and a reflection in a plane, perpendicular to the axis of rotation, results in the same molecule. For tetrahedral molecules, the molecule is chiral if all four substituents are different."}, {"url": "http://www.creative-chemistry.org.uk/molecules/optical.htm", "passage_text": "Optical isomerism is an example of stereo-isomerism. It occurs when substances have the same molecular and structural formulae, but one cannot be superimposed on the other. Put simply, they are mirror images of each other (see the diagram on the right). Optical isomers can occur when there is an asymmetric carbon atom. An asymmetric carbon atom is one which is bonded to four different groups. The groups can be something hideously complex, or something comfortably simple like a hydrogen or chlorine atom."}, {"url": "http://chemguide.co.uk/basicorg/isomerism/optical.html", "passage_text": "STEREOISOMERISM-OPTICAL ISOMERISM. Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. This page explains what stereoisomers are and how you recognise the possibility of optical isomers in a molecule. A solution of one enantiomer rotates the plane of polarisation in a clockwise direction. This enantiomer is known as the (+) form. For example, one of the optical isomers (enantiomers) of the amino acid alanine is known as (+)alanine. A solution of the other enantiomer rotates the plane of polarisation in an anti-clockwise direction. This enantiomer is known as the (-) form"}]
