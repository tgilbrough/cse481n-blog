All I can say is that it is awful!!! It seemed like Dry Penne with a couple tablespoons of old tomato paste. Now, even those with gluten intolerance can feel a part of the experience! Apparently Olive Garden has prepared a number of their specialty dishes without gluten and posted a gluten free menu on their website."}, {"url": "http://www.glutenfibrofree.com/restaurants-2/eating-gluten-free-at-olive-garden/", "passage_text": "While Olive Garden only has 7 items on their gluten-free menu, only one of which is a pasta dish, there are still a couple more that I would like to try. I chose to avoid the pasta dish tonight since I had read the bad review before. The waiter was very nice and brought me a separate salad bowl without croutons. With pasta being their thing, you might expect a lot of options, but that is not the case. Expect to have a few good options and have an enjoyable experience with your family. I applaud Olive Garden for being one of the first restaurants to offer a gluten-free menu."}, {"url": "http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/olive-garden-gluten-menu-6880.html", "passage_text": "Olive Garden Options.
