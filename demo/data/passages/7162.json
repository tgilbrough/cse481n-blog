The variety of genetic tests has expanded throughout the years. In the past, the main genetic tests searched for abnormal chromosome numbers and mutations that lead to rare, inherited disorders. Today, tests involve analyzing multiple genes to determine the risk of developing certain more common diseases such as heart disease and cancer. 1 Predictive testing can identify mutations that increase a person's chances of developing disorders with a genetic basis, such as certain types of cancer. 2  For example, an individual with a mutation in BRCA1 has a 65% cumulative risk of breast cancer."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_test", "passage_text": "In addition to studying chromosomes to the level of individual genes, genetic testing in a broader sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases, or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders. 1 Predictive testing can identify mutations that increase a person's chances of developing disorders with a genetic basis, such as certain types of cancer. 2  For example, an individual with a mutation in BRCA1 has a 65% cumulative risk of breast cancer."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_test", "passage_text": "The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder.
