As a practical matter, you would like to see the concrete temperature not go below 40F. At about 39F, the density of water decreases and continues to decrease until it freezes. Further, long term performance of concrete with regard to temperature differential is affected. If you have the proper mix design, heated water, protected or heated aggregates and reasonable protection from the elements, the heat of hydration will over-rule the air temperature if the base the concrete is on is not too cold."}, {"url": "http://www.murray.utah.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/3744", "passage_text": "If concrete temperature is greater than 60\u00ba F and the air temperature is 50\u00ba F the concrete needs to be protected from drying by using a curing compound or steam heating ACI 306R-88 Chpt 8.2 The contractor is still responsible for following all requirements in ACI 306R and APWA. 3 mix.
