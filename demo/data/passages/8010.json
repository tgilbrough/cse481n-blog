Pyrimidines are just the 6 member ring you made in the purine. It is called a 1 3 diazine ring. Pyrimidines are the basis of the other nucleic bases in DNA and RNA called cytosine, uracil, and thymine. Pyrimidines have much lower boiling points and molecular masses than purines."}, {"url": "http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-purine-and-vs-pyrimidine/", "passage_text": "Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are examples for pyrimidine bases. Adenine and guanine are the two purine bases. DNA has adenine, Guanine, cytosine, and thymine bases, whereas RNA has A, G, C, and uracil (instead of thymine). In DNA and RNA, complimentary bases form hydrogen bonds between them. That is adenine: thiamine/ uracil and guanine: cytosine are complimentary to each other. They have the following structures. In nucleic acids, purine groups make hydrogen bonds with complementary pyrimidine bases. That is adenine makes hydrogen bonds with thymine and guanine makes hydrogen bonds with cytosine. IN RNA, since thymine is absent, adenine makes hydrogen bonds with uracil."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purine", "passage_text": "Two of the five bases in nucleic acids, adenine (2) and guanine (3), are purines. In DNA, these bases form hydrogen bonds with their complementary pyrimidines thymine and cytosine, respectively. This is called complementary base pairing.
