Beef that grades prime has the highest degree of fat in the muscle. Fat is what gives meat its flavor and juiciness. Marbling does not mean it will be tender. Tenderness comes from young animals and from muscles that have not been exercised hard. That is why a rib eye steak is generally more tender than a round steak."}, {"url": "http://foodreference.about.com/od/Meat/a/Usda-Beef-Grades.htm", "passage_text": "The beef grading system developed by the United States Department of Agriculture is a voluntary grading system based on the meat's maturity and level of fat marbling.

The age of a beef animal has a direct effect on tenderness of the meat it produces. As cattle mature, their meat becomes progressively tougher. To account for the effects of the maturing process on beef tenderness, evaluations of carcass maturity are used in determining USDA Quality Grades."}]
