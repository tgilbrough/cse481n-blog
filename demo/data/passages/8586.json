In the nucleus of each cell, the DNA molecule is packaged into thread-like structures called chromosomes. Each chromosome is made up of DNA tightly coiled many times around proteins called histones that support its structure. Chromosomes are not visible in the cell\u2019s nucleus\u2014not even under a microscope\u2014when the cell is not dividing."}, {"url": "http://sciencenetlinks.com/student-teacher-sheets/cells-your-body/", "passage_text": "All living things, large or small, plant or animal, are made up of cells. Most living things are made up of one cell and they are called unicellular organisms. Many other living things are made up of a large number of cells that form a larger plant or animal. These living things are known as multicellular organisms. Water makes up about two thirds of the weight of cells. All the parts of your body are made up of cells. There is no such thing as a typical cell. Your body has many different kinds of cells.

One of the things that all cells have in common is a cell membrane. It is a barrier that separates a cell from its surrounding environment. This outer boundary of the cell is also called the plasma membrane. This ensures that the cells will be able to get rid of wastes and take up important nutrients and gases. The plasma membrane is a fluid mosaic. This means that it is flexible and made up of many different types of molecules. Phospholipids form the basic structure of a cell membrane, called the lipid bilayer."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/cell-membrane-functions-role-structure.html", "passage_text": "Phospholipids make up the basic structure of a cell membrane. A single phospholipid molecule has two different ends: a head and a tail. The head end contains a phosphate group and is hydrophilic. This means that it likes or is attracted to water molecules.

Two types of cells that make up all living things on earth: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

The cell membrane is sometimes also referred to as the plasma membrane. If the DNA within a cell is not separated from the cytoplasm, then that cell is a prokaryote. All known prokaryotes, such as bacteria and archaea, are single cells. In contrast, if the DNA is partitioned off in its own membrane-bound room called the nucleus, then that cell is a eukaryote."}]
