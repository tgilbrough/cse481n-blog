A laptop generates much less heat than a desktop PC. Jupiterimages/Brand X Pictures/Getty Images. Every computing device produces heat in proportion to the electricity it consumes. In desktop PCs, the microprocessor gets its own fan. By themselves, these chips generate from a few watts of heat to nearly 100 watts, depending on the device and application.

Shankar Subramanian A common situation encountered by the chemical engineer is heat transfer to fluid flowing through a tube. This can occur in heat exchangers, boilers, condensers, evaporators, and a host of other process equipment. Remember that the purpose of using a heat transfer coefficient is to calculate the heat flux between the wall and the fluid. In the case of uniform wall flux, we can use an energy balance directly to infer the way in which the bulk average temperature of the fluid changes with distance along the axial direction."}, {"url": "http://www.pcper.com/reviews/Cases-and-Cooling/General-Fan-Performance-Guide/Air-Velocity-and-Heat-Sink-Fans", "passage_text": "For case cooling, volumetric flow rate and air temperature are all that really matter. For cooling a heat sink, however, air velocity is also critical. Air velocity is one of the biggest determinants of the convection coefficient. Average air velocity at the fan is defined as flow rate divided by fan area. As air leaves the fan, it will not remain a fixed diameter column of moving air. It will disperse and its average velocity will drop. As it disperses, it will entrain some of the surrounding, static air. To compare the air velocity of different fans, divide the rated flow by the fan diameter squared. As an example, a 60mm fan pumping 38CFM yields a relative velocity of .0106 while an 80mm fan pumping the same volume yields .0059. The air velocity from the 60mm fan will be 78% higher resulting in better air convection."}, {"url": "http://www.quomon.com/44777/What-is-an-average-CPU-Temperature-for-a-laptop-computer", "passage_text": "IDLE temperature (meaning the laptop is not doing anything) around 30-50 degrees celcius is perfectly normal.

The vapor then travels along the heat pipe to the cold interface and condenses back into a liquid-releasing the latent heat. The advantage of heat pipes over many other heat-dissipation mechanisms is their great efficiency in transferring heat. A pipe one inch in diameter and two feet long can transfer 12,500 BTU (3.7 kWh) per hour at 1,800 \u00b0F (980 \u00b0C) with only 18 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) drop from end to end."}, {"url": "http://smallbusiness.chron.com/average-heat-output-computer-69494.html", "passage_text": "Components and Heat.
