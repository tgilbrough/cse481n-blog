The average composite score is roughly a 21. That is, about 50% of test-takers score below a 21. For students who took the ACT with writing, the writing section is scored on a 12-point scale. The average score is between 7 and 8. Very few students get a perfect ACT score, even those who get into the country's top colleges. In fact, anyone scoring a 34, 35 or 36 is among the top 1% of test-takers in the country. The table above shows the middle 50% range of ACT scores for different schools.

A 23 on the ACT or a 1800 on the SAT may be above average at one university but below average at another. The higher your score, the more options are open to you. Above average SAT/ACT scores will improve your chances of getting into a more selective school. Scores below an 1100 on the SAT or a 15 on ACT are considered low at just about any four-year college.
