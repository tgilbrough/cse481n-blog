Another definition states that all existing things go back to a source that is distinct from them (e.g. in Neoplatonism everything is derived from The One). 1 Partial monism, within a given realm of being (however many there may be) there is only one substance. 2  Existence monism, the view that there is only one concrete object token (The One, \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f15\u03bd or the Monad)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism", "passage_text": "Another distinction is the difference between substance and existence monism, or stuff monism and thing monism.

Epistemological monism identifies that which is immediately present to the knowing mind with the real object known.
