With a 10 year/100,000 mile powertrain warranty, a powertrain is covered for up to 10 years or 100,000 miles, or whichever comes first. Even if you only put 50,000 miles on a car in 10 years, your coverage will end at that point. Conversely, if you pass 100,000 miles before the 10 years is up, your warranty will lapse."}, {"url": "http://www.carcarepeople.com/ford-powertrain-warranty", "passage_text": "When a new Ford is purchased it comes with the Ford powertrain warranty as part of the Ford factory warranty.
