For other uses, see Northern Rock (disambiguation) . NRAM plc (previously Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc) is a British asset holding and management company which was split away from the Northern Rock bank in 2010. It is currently under public ownership, due to the bank's nationalisation in 2008. On 16 May 2014 the company changed its name to the shorter NRAM plc.

It is a type of nonvolatile random access memory based on the position of carbon nanotubes deposited on a chip-like substrate. In theory, the small size of the nanotubes allows for very high density memories. The second generation NRAM technology is based on a two-terminal memory cell. The two-terminal cell has advantages such as a smaller cell size, better scalability to sub-20 nm nodes (see semiconductor device fabrication), and the ability to passivate the memory cell during fabrication."}, {"url": "http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/NRAM", "passage_text": "The Bits Are Nanotubes. An NRAM 0 or 1 bit is determined by whether the tubes are straight up or bent down. Changing the charge on the electrode changes the data state (0 or 1) by attracting or repelling the positively charged nanotube. When straight up, the tubes have high resistance; when bent down, they have low resistance. NRAM is expected to be faster and denser than DRAM and also very scalable; able to handle 5 nm bit cells whenever CMOS fabrication advances to that level. It is also very stable in its 0 or 1 state."}, {"url": "http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1326794", "passage_text": "Having been working on its NRAM technology for more than a decade, it s time for Nantero to show what they ve got, said Alan Niebel, CEO of WebFeet Research.
