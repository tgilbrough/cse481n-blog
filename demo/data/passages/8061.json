They are widely used in industries due to their nontoxicity. To become dextrin, the starch is subjected to a hydrolysis process that divides the long molecular chains of starch. The resulting material is dextrin, a simple carbohydrate with low molecular weight, which has different properties, depending on its chemical composition. Dextrins are usually dried for easy handling and transportation. Since they are soluble in water, it is very easy to transform it again into a liquid solution"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextrin", "passage_text": "Dextrins are mixtures of polymers of D-glucose units linked by \u03b1-(1\u21924) or \u03b1-(1\u21926) glycosidic bonds. 1 (Beta) Limit dextrin is the remaining polymer produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of amylopectin with beta amylase, which cannot hydrolyse the alpha-1,6 bonds at branch points.
