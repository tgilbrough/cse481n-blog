All wireless devices on a WLAN must employ the same SSID in order to communicate with each other. The SSID is a sequence of alphanumeric characters (letters or numbers).

The point of both methods is to automatically connect to the correct access point. If neither is defined, the client will be prompted to select an access point from a list of detected access points. Then type /sbin/arp-a and you will see your IP address to MAC address associations. Just as DNS matches names to IP addresses, the arp protocol associates MAC addresses to IP addresses on the local network. This is the OSI layer 2, or DataLink layer at work."}, {"url": "http://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/network-director1.5/topics/concept/wireless-ssid-bssid-essid.html", "passage_text": "Understanding the Network Terms SSID, BSSID, and ESSID. The terms BSSID, ESSID, and SSID are all used to describe sections of a wireless network (WLAN)\u2014the three terms have slightly different meanings. As a wireless user you are concerned only with the broadcast SSIDs that let you connect to a wireless network. However, there are usually multiple access points within each WLAN, and there has to be a way to identify those access points and their associated clients. This identifier is called a basic service set identifier (BSSID) and is included in all wireless packets. Figure 2: Each Access Point Has Its Own BSS. As a user, you are usually unaware of which basic service set (BSS) you currently belong to"}, {"url": "http://sourcedaddy.com/networking/bssid-ssid-and-essid.html", "passage_text": "The Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) defines the most basic infrastructure mode network, a BSS of one WAP and one or more wireless nodes. With such a simple network, the Wi-Fi folks didn't see any reason to create some new numbering or naming scheme, so they made the BSSID the same as the MAC address for the WAP. Unfortunately, most Wi-Fi devices just use the term SSID, not ESSID. When you configure a wireless device to connect to an ESS, you're technically using the ESSID rather than just the SSID, but the manufacturer often has tried to make it simple for you by using only the term SSID."}, {"url": "http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/wireless/g/bldef_ssid.htm", "passage_text": "A network administrator often uses a public SSID, that is set on the access point and broadcast to all wireless devices in range.
