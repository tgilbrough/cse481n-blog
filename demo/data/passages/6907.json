It most commonly forms in clear, warm, shallow marine waters. It is usually an organic sedimentary rock that forms from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal and fecal debris. A rock known as tufa is a limestone formed by evaporation at a hot spring, lake shore, or other area. Limestone is by definition a rock that contains at least 50% calcium carbonate in the form of calcite by weight. All limestones contain at least a few percent other materials. These can be small particles of quartz, feldspar, clay minerals, pyrite, siderite and other mineral"}, {"url": "http://www.bengadd.com/Downloads/Geology%20of%20the%20Rockies%20and%20Columbias%20plus%20time%20scale%202014.pdf", "passage_text": "\u2014and dolomite.

The cores of the mountain ranges are in most places formed of pieces of continental crust that are over one billion years old. In the south, an older mountain range was formed 300 million years ago, then eroded away. The rocks of that older range were reformed into the Rocky Mountains. The Rocky Mountains took shape during an intense period of plate tectonic activity that resulted in much of the rugged landscape of the western North America. The Laramide orogeny, about 80\u201355 million years ago, was the last of the three episodes and was responsible for raising the Rocky Mountains. "}]
