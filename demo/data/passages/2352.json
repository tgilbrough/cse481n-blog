How to use LIQUID DESCALER: Descale equipment in water wells by using to 5 to 10 gallons per 100 gallons of water inside casing. (See table for calculation). LIQUID DESCALER should remain in the well for 24-36 hours and should be agitated every few hours."}, {"url": "http://www.watersoftenercritic.com/eddy-electronic-descaler-review/", "passage_text": "If you have don e a little research into the types of water softeners on the market at the moment, you would have come across the Eddy Electronic Water Descaler, which is said to be a great alternative to a water softener system-it basically does the same thing as a traditional water softener, but in a different way. If you want to learn a little more about about how magnetic water softeners work, check this page out. The Eddy descaler is a very popular item in the world of water softening, but there are mixed reviews-lots of lovers, but plenty of haters."}, {"url": "http://www.apexengineeringproducts.com/products/rydlymehome/", "passage_text": "RYDLYME the World's Leading Biodegradable Descaler!

This builds up over time and eventually the water flow is blocked off and the item no longer functions correctly. A water descaler dissolves the calcium or magnesium which has built up. The calcium or magnesium is absorbed from the ground into the water supply so whether you have hard or soft water is dependant on the ground where you live. Scale is the solid layer that is deposited on the surfaces inside pipes, boilers, heaters etc. Chemically, scale is combination of water insoluble salts of Calcium and Magnesium-CaCO3 (limescale) and MgCO3."}, {"url": "http://www.freedrinkingwater.com/water_quality/quality1/50-08-water-filter-differ-from-descaler-conditioner-softener.htm", "passage_text": "This is different from a water filter system, in that filters will generally remove bacteria (in some cases), suspended particles (sand, sediment, etc.) and specific chemicals, depending on the filter media. Most filter systems do not remove dissolved solids, such as those that cause hardness. Water filter systems are primarily concerned with trapping bacteria or solids which could produce bacterial conditions in those who drink from it."}, {"url": "http://www.freedrinkingwater.com/water_quality/quality1/50-08-water-filter-differ-from-descaler-conditioner-softener.htm", "passage_text": "Newer pressure filtration systems capable of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis filtration will remove salts, and reduce hardness. A descaler does not remove dissolved solids; it attempts to prevent the solids from being deposited inside pipes, on fixtures, etc. The word conditioner is very vague and is commonly used in reference to lime scale prevention.

Scale is the solid layer that is deposited on the surfaces inside pipes, boilers, heaters etc. Chemically, scale is combination of water insoluble salts of Calcium and Magnesium-CaCO3 (limescale) and MgCO3.

A Descaler doesn\u2019t actually soften the water, so there is no slick soft water feel, but it does keep the dissolved scale minerals from being deposited on the inside of pipes, dishwashers, and washing machines. However, all have proven to be ineffective. The Scale Stop Descaler system has achieved a 99.6% effectiveness rating, which is far more effective than any other softener alternative.
