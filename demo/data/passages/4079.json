From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A Pu Pu platter, Pu-Pu platter or pupu platter is a tray of American Chinese cuisine or Hawaiian cuisine consisting of an assortment of small meat and seafood appetizers. The earliest known print reference to a pupu platter served at a Chinese restaurant is from 1969. Later, other types of restaurants used pu pu platter to mean an appetizer combination platters.

Pu-erh tea is made from the leaves and stems of the Camellia sinensis plant. This is the same plant that is used for making green, oolong, and black teas. Though the same source plant is used, the different teas are made by using different processes. The body breaks down the caffeine in pu-erh tea to get rid of it. Fluvoxamine (Luvox) can decrease how quickly the body breaks down caffeine. Taking pu-erh tea along with fluvoxamine (Luvox) might cause too much caffeine in the body, and increase the effects and side effects of caffeine."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-1169-PU-ERH%20TEA.aspx?activeIngredientId=1169&activeIngredientName=PU-ERH%20TEA", "passage_text": "Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, pu-erh tea in small amounts is probably not harmful.
