After crude oil is removed from the ground, it is sent to a refinery by pipeline, ship, or barge. In order to make finished petroleum products, these substances are separated at the refinery into different boiling fractions (i.e., gases, naphtha, residuum, etc.)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil", "passage_text": "Though crude oil is predominantly composed of various hydrocarbons, certain nitrogen heterocylic compounds, such as pyridine, picoline, and quinoline are reported as contaminants associated with crude oil, as well as facilities processing oil shale or coal, and have also been found at legacy wood treatment sites. Petroleum is recovered mostly through oil drilling (natural petroleum springs are rare). This comes after the studies of structural geology (at the reservoir scale), sedimentary basin analysis, reservoir characterization (mainly in terms of the porosity and permeability of geologic reservoir structures)."}, {"url": "http://toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/text_version/chemicals.php?id=73", "passage_text": "This process is why crude oil is called a fossil fuel. Crude oil is extracted and used to make fuel and other petroleum products. Hydraulic fracturing is one method used to extract oil and natural gas from deep shale formations. Crude oil is a mixture of a wide variety of constituents. It consists primarily of hydrocarbons, which are chemicals composed of hydrogen and carbon. Crude oil also contains hundreds of substances that include benzene, chromium, iron, mercury, nickel, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, toluene, and xylene. There are four types of crude oil: Class A: Light, Volatile Oils: These oils are highly fluid and highly toxic to humans and include jet fuel and gasoline. Class B: Non-Sticky Oils: These oils are waxy and less toxic to humans and include diesel fuel and light crude oil."}, {"url": "http://www.educationquizzes.com/gcse/chemistry/crude-oil-substances-from-crude-oil/", "passage_text": "Crude Oil-Substances from Crude Oil.
