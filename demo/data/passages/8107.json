Some of the common Disaccharides are as follows. 1  Sucrose (table sugar, cane sugar, beet sugar): It is a white, odorless crystalline powder with a sweet taste. 2  It is best known for its role in human nutrition. 3  Sucrose is made up of glucose (monosaccharide) and fructose (monosaccharide)."}, {"url": "http://www.ivyroses.com/HumanBiology/Nutrition/Types-of-Sugar.php", "passage_text": "The two main categories of sugars are monosaccharides and disaccharides. They are often described together with polysaccharides, and sometimes also oligosaccarides, due to the chemical relationship between these types of carbohydrates: 1  Categories of sugars 2  : Monosaccharides are simple (unit) sugars.

Disaccharide is one of the four chemical groupings of carbohydrates (monosaccharide, disaccharide, oligosaccharide, and polysaccharide). The most common types of disaccharides\u2014 sucrose, lactose, and maltose \u2014have twelve carbon atoms, with the general formula C 12 H 22 O 11. Maltose, another notable disaccharide, is made up of two glucose molecules. The two monosaccharides are bonded via a dehydration reaction (also called a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis) that leads to the loss of a molecule of water and formation of a glycosidic bond."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaccharide", "passage_text": "Disaccharides are formed when two monosaccharides are joined together and a molecule of water is removed, a process known as dehydration reaction. For example; milk sugar (lactose) is made from glucose and galactose whereas the sugar from sugar cane and sugar beets (sucrose) is made from glucose and fructose.
