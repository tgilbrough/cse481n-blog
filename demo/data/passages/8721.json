There are three different types of neurones, each with a slightly different function. 1  Sensory neurones carry signals from sensory receptors to the spinal cord and brain. 2  Together, the spinal cord and brain make up the central nervous system."}, {"url": "http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/nervecell.html", "passage_text": "Many nerve cells are of the basic type illustrated above. Some kind of stimulus triggers an electric discharge of the cell which is analogous to the discharge of a capacitor. This produces an electrical pulse on the order of 50-70 millivolts called an action potential."}, {"url": "https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/cells.html", "passage_text": "Types of Neurons (Nerve Cells). The human body is made up of trillions of cells. Cells of the nervous system, called nerve cells or neurons, are specialized to carry messages through an electrochemical process. The human brain has approximately 100 billion neurons. To learn how neurons carry messages, read about the action potential. Neurons come in many different shapes and sizes."}, {"url": "https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/004012.htm", "passage_text": "Nerve tissue is made up of nerve cells (neurons) and is used to carry messages to and from various parts of the body.

Nerves are specialised cells-they carry messages from one part of the body to another, as tiny electrical signals."}]
