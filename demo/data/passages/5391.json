As a rheostat, the variable resistor is connected in series with a load, and two of its three terminals are used-one of the fixed terminal and the slider terminal. A rheostat is a resistor with variable resistance.There are many type of rheostat,involved of a rotary-type rheostat and a sliding rheostst.I dunn know much about the rotary-t \u2026 ype rheostat but I can tell u how does a sliding rheostat work."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_a_microscope_rheostat_control", "passage_text": "A rheostat is a resistor with variable resistance.There are many type of rheostat,involved of a rotary-type rheostat and a sliding rheostst.I dunn know much about the rotary-t \u2026 ype rheostat but I can tell u how does a sliding rheostat work.

Rheostats in cathodic protection. a rheostat is a resistor used to adjust current in a circuit. can any body please tell me what is the use of ammeter. An ammeter measures the electric current in a circuit. Rheostat Construction. Most rheostats are the wire-wound type that have a long length of conductive wire coiled into a tight spiral. The linear type has a straight coil, while the rotary type has the coil curved into a torus to save space."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110827035658AAbMBRw", "passage_text": "Report Abuse. A rheostat is an adjustable resistor that is used to control the electrical resistance of a circuit without interrupting the flow of electrical current to that circuit. Rheostats are used for appliances and other items that need both high voltage and electrical current that can be interrupted. A rheostat is simply a coil of resistance wire with a slider on it so that the resistance can be varied. The list of ways that it can be used is very long. Prior to solid state devices they have been used to control lighting or battery charging. speed control of motors. production of variable emf etc."}, {"url": "http://www.tech-faq.com/rheostat.html", "passage_text": "Rheostats. A rheostat is an electrical component that has an adjustable resistance. It is a type of potentiometer that has two terminals instead of three.

A rheostat is a simple variable resistor with two contacts. A resistor is a device designed to resist the flow of electricity. The more resistance an electronic current has, the more slowly the current in it flows. Inside a Rheostat. Most rheostats contain a strip of some substance with fairly high resistance, such as carbon. One of the rheostat's two contacts attaches to the end of the carbon strip. The other moves along the strip as you adjust the rheostat slider or knob."}]
