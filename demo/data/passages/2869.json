One popular definition is designing and constructing biological devices, biological systems, and biological machines for useful purposes.. Synthetic life [edit].

Synthetic biology is the design and construction of biological modules, from enzymes to complete cells. Synthetic biology combines biology, chemistry, and engineering, and strives to create new systems to solve specific problems. Synthetic biologists attempt to design, model and then fabricate ideal biological systems. Applications for synthetic biology include drug discovery, the production of biofuels, \u201cbiosensing\u201d (using a biological component to detect an environmental signal), investigating disease mechanisms, and more."}, {"url": "http://bioethics.gov/sites/default/files/PCSBI-Synthetic-Biology-FAQ.pdf", "passage_text": "A: Synthetic biology is the name given to an emerging field of research that combines elements of biology, engineering, genetics, chemistry, and computer science.
