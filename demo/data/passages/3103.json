The two types of igneous rocks most common on Earth are called granite and basalt. Granite is a rock that typically looks pink and white with black specks. Basalt generally just looks black. The Six Types of Igneous Rocks. To recap, granite is a coarse-grained felsic rock, while basalt is a fine-grained mafic rock. All of the other combinations have names too. A coarse-grained mafic rock is called gabbro, and a fine-grained felsic rock is called rhyolite."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_difference_between_granitic_magma_and_basaltic_magma", "passage_text": "Grantic magma is rich in silica with abundant sodium and potassium. It has an extremely high viscosity and cools to form light-colored rocks. Basaltic magma is low in silica with abundant iron and magnesium. It has the lowest viscosity among the common types of magma and cools to form dark-colored rocks. Basalt is the foundation of oceanic crust. Granite is an intrusive igneous rock made from visible mineral crystals, a result of cooling over a longer period of time under the surface of the Earth.

Granite-typically composed of orthoclase, hornblende, biotite, and quartz-is a felsic rock type. Basalt is mostly olivine, augite, and calcium-rich plagioclase, therefore mafic. slide 3 of 6.
