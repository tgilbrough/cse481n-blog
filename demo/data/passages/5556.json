The amount of energy used by each appliance depends on how much power it draws when in operation and how much of the time it is used. The power usage is measured in watts and kilowatts (a kilowatt =1000 watts), and the amount of energy that it consumes in watt-hours or kilowatt hours (kWh). A single bar electric fire often uses electricity at the rate of one kilowatt (kW) per hour. So, in an hour an electric fire will use one kilowatt hour (kWh).
