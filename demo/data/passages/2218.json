For example, a command's syntax may dictate case sensitivity and what kinds of options are available that make the command operate in different ways. Syntax is Like a Language. To better understand computer syntax, think of it as a language, like English, German, Spanish, etc. A language syntax requires that certain words and punctuation be used in the right way so that someone hearing or reading the words can understand them correctly."}, {"url": "http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/syntax", "passage_text": "Part of the Programming glossary: Syntax is the grammar, structure, or order of the elements in a language statement. (Semantics is the meaning of these elements.) Syntax applies to computer languages as well as to natural languages. Usually, we think of syntax as word order.. However, syntax is also achieved in some languages such as Latin by inflectional case endings."}, {"url": "http://literarydevices.net/syntax/", "passage_text": "Syntax and Diction. Syntax and diction are closely related. Diction refers to the choice of words in a particular situation while syntax determines how the chosen words are used to form a sentence. Most often than not, adopting a complex diction means a complex syntactic structure of sentences and vice versa. Syntax is a set of rules in a language. It dictates how words from different parts of speech are put together in order to convey a complete thought."}, {"url": "http://www.whitesmoke.com/what-is-syntax", "passage_text": "Syntax is a form of grammar. It is concerned primarily with word order in a sentence and with the agreement of words when they are used together. So it is, in a sense, acting as a kind of \u2018police officer\u2019 for the way in which sentences are constructed. "}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-syntax.htm", "passage_text": "Word order is important when learning a new language. Syntax looks at the rules of a language, particularly how the various parts of sentences go together. Linguists and grammarians look at how people actually speak. Perhaps the most important aspect of syntax is how the various parts of speech connect together. Every language has rules that dictate where certain types of words can be used in a sentence, and how to interpret the resulting sentence."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/about_4777970_what-is-syntax.html", "passage_text": "Maria Teijeiro/Photodisc/Getty Images.
