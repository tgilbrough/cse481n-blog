Typical simple aromatic compounds are benzene, indole, and cyclotetradecaheptaene. Simple aromatic rings with non-carbon ring atoms are called  heterocyclic . For example, rings can include oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. Molecules with one ring are called monocyclic as in benzene. Molecules with two rings are called bicyclic as in naphthalene. Molecules with more than two rings are called polycyclic as in anthracene. Simple monocyclic aromatic rings are usually five-membered rings like pyrrole or six-membered rings like pyridine.
