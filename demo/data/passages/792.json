"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desiderata,_wife_of_Charlemagne", "passage_text": "Desiderata or Ermengarda was one of four daughters of Desiderius, king of the Lombards, and his queen, Ansa. She was married to Charlemagne, king of the Franks, in 770, probably to form a bond between the otherwise enemy states of Francia and Lombardy. The marriage was annulled in 771 and this hurt relations with Lombardy, presaging the war of 774. She had no known children and her ultimate fate is unknown. Although she is commonly referred to by the name Desiderata, it is now theorised that the name derives from an editorial error in a 19th-century copy of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica which capitalised the D in desideratam filiam (Latin for desired daughter)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carloman_I", "passage_text": "Carloman I (28 June 751 \u2013 4 December 771) was the king of the Franks from 768 until his death in 771. He was the second surviving son of Pepin the Short and Bertrada of Laon and was a younger brother of Charlemagne. Little is known of him, except such as touches upon his more famous father and brother. At the time of his death, he and his brother Charlemagne were close to outright war, which Charlemagne's biographer Einhard attributes to the miscounsel of Carloman's advisors.

Sadly, Clark wouldn\u2019t probably want to be remembered for either of those things. They didn\u2019t. Just a bit of digging provides the truth, but yet every Clark Gable bio I own says that they did. In turn, they, like any celebrity couple, constantly endured rumors of strife and infidelity. I have yet to find an actress who admits sleeping with Clark when he was with Carole."}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/2014/01/19/why-did-carole-lombard-die/", "passage_text": "Carole Lombard, 1935.

Himiltrude bore Charlemagne two children, but he put her aside in order to marry Desiderata. There are twenty people who are recorded to have been children of Charlemagne. He probably had others.
