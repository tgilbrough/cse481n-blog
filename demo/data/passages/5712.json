Cardiac and skeletal are both striated muscle as repeating units called sarcomeres give the cells a striated appearance, while smooth muscle lacks such striations. Specifically, we have three different types of muscle tissue, including skeletal, cardiac, and smooth. Each type of muscle is unique in terms of its structure and its function. Regardless of the specific type, all muscle serves the same general function, and that is support and movement."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/types-of-muscle-tissue-skeletal-cardiac-smooth.html", "passage_text": "Skeletal muscle tissue is found in our skeletal muscles; for example, the biceps. Cardiac muscle is found in our heart, and smooth muscle is found in our visceral, or hollow, organs-for example, blood vessels and intestines. All muscles contract as a result of interaction between special proteins within the myocytes. Specifically, we have three different types of muscle tissue, including skeletal, cardiac, and smooth. Each type of muscle is unique in terms of its structure and its function. Regardless of the specific type, all muscle serves the same general function, and that is support and movement."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081014152339AAsbrSP", "passage_text": "Best Answer: Tissue that has the ability to contract, either voluntarily or involuntarily. It can be striated or smooth. The three kinds are skeletal muscle tissue, cardiac muscle tissue, and smooth muscle tissue. The characteristics of all muscle tissue are: 1.Contractility -- the muscle has the ability to shorten. 2. Excitability -- it responds to a stimulus.

Smooth muscle fibers are small and tapered-with the ends reducing in size, in contrast to the cylindrical shape of skeletal muscle. Each smooth muscle fiber has a single centrally located nucleus. The functions of muscle tissues depend on the type of muscle tissues and their locations in the body. Here is an overview of the 3 types of muscle tissues : : Skeletal muscle is called striated because of its appearance consisting of light and dark bands visible using a light microscope."}, {"url": "http://depts.gpc.edu/~decms/ibim/musclesnmustis.htm", "passage_text": "There are three types of muscle tissues: skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. a. skeletal muscle: multinucleated, striated; attached to bones producing locomotion, general support and posture; producing heat. Contraction is voluntary, and not long-sustained. MUSCLES AND MUSCLE TISSUE. Muscle is composed of fibers, nerves and connective tissues and account for over 40% of the body weight. The fibers contract to produce tension on the associated tissues or tendons. Muscle tissue is enclosed in facia, which in turn is attached to other structures including ligament. There are three types of muscle tissues: skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. Muscle tissue provides a) posture and body support b) locomotion and c) heat production"}, {"url": "http://www.livescience.com/26854-muscular-system-facts-functions-diseases.html", "passage_text": "Three types of muscles. The muscular system can be broken down into three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth and cardiac, according to the NIH. Skeletal muscles are the only voluntary muscle tissue in the human body and control every action that a person consciously performs. Visceral, or smooth, muscle is found inside organs such as the stomach and intestines, as well as in blood vessels. It is called a smooth muscle because, unlike skeletal muscle, it does not have the banded appearance of skeletal or cardiac muscle."}, {"url": "http://biology.about.com/od/anatomy/a/aa022808a.htm", "passage_text": "Muscle tissue is made of excitable cells that are capable of contraction. Of all of the different tissue types (muscle, epithelial, connective, and nervous), muscle tissue is the most abundant in most animals. There are three major types of muscle tissue: 1  Cardiac Muscle. 2  Cardiac muscle is so named because it is found in the heart. 3  Cells are joined to one another by intercalated discs which allow the synchronization of the heart beat."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tissue", "passage_text": "Muscle tissue is a soft tissue that composes muscles in animal bodies, and gives rise to muscles' ability to contract. This is opposed to other components or tissues in muscle such as tendons or perimysium. It is formed during embryonic development through a process known as myogenesis. Muscle tissue varies with function and location in the body. In mammals the three types are: skeletal or striated muscle; smooth or non-striated muscle; and cardiac muscle, which is sometimes known as semi-striated"}, {"url": "http://classes.midlandstech.edu/carterp/Courses/bio210/chap09/lecture1.html", "passage_text": "Overview of Muscle Tissues. Types of Muscle Tissue. Skeletal muscle is associated with the bony skeleton, and consists of large cells that bear striations and are controlled voluntarily. Cardiac muscle occurs only in the heart, and consists of small cells that are striated and under involuntary control. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of hollow organs, and consists of small elongated cells that are not striated and are under involuntary control. Special Characteristics of Muscle Tissue. Excitability, or irritability, is the ability to receive and respond to a stimulus"}]
