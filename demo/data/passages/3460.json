Patients may also develop tinea versicolor-like lesions on the trunk. Epidermodysplasia verruciformis lesions may progress to form verrucous plaques and nodules, or they may transform into invasive squamous cell carcinomas, most commonly between the ages of 20 and 40 years. The clinical course of epidermodysplasia verruciformis is protracted. Epidermodysplasia verruciformis variants may be suspected when a patient has the typical clinical presentation in the setting of epidermodysplasia verruciformis\u2013associated HPV but lacks nonmelanoma skin cancers at a young age or has late-onset disease."}, {"url": "http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1131981-overview", "passage_text": "Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a rare, inherited disorder that predisposes patients to widespread human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas.

Epidermodysplasia verruciformis, otherwise known as, Lutz-Lewandowsky epidermodysplasia verruciformis or Lewandowsky-Lutz dysplasia is a genetic disorder of the skin that is very rare in nature. It is particularly an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, with 10 to 20% of the cases being so. 1 Other cases of epidermodysplasia verruciformis, on the other hand, are predominantly spots that are white in color and very much resembles tinea and pityriasis versicolor, which usually develops in the trunk area. 2  Pityriasis versicolor, by the way, is a pale, rash caused by a yeast-like germ."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermodysplasia_verruciformis", "passage_text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
