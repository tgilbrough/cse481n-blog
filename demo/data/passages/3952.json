The manufacturer's maintenance schedule for many automatic transmissions doesn't call for fresh fluid until 100,000 miles or, with some Ford transmissions, even 150,000 miles. A lot of mechanics say that is too long and it should be done at least every 50,000 miles. Manual transmissions may be on a different schedule, so it's best to consult the maintenance schedule in the owner's manual.
