It may be a good idea to have your Vitamin D levels tested, which can drive the PTH levels up independent of a primary parathyroid problem. Parathyroid glands make parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates the balance of calcium and phosphorous levels in the body. Hyperparathyroidism is caused by too much PTH, which causes excess calcium in the body. Hypoparathyroidism is the result of too little PTH, causing a deficiency of"}]
