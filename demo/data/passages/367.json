[{"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_should_your_heart_rate_be", "passage_text": "Your resting heart rate should be between 60-100 beats per minute. If you are an athlete or train a lot, your resting heart rate could be lower. That is an average. Resting heart rate above 150 is tachycardia (fast). During exercise, you should shoot for between 40-60% of your heart rate max which is generally estimated by subtracting your age from 220. Example a 20 year old (220-20=200) would have a max heart rate of 200. You should be careful when starting exercise not to get your heart rate too close to max. For athletes-or people who often perform cardiovascular activity  - a normal resting heart rate may be closer to 40 beats a minute.      If your your heart rate is continuously above 120 bpm or below 40  bpm you should consult a doctor."}, {"url": "http://www.runnersworld.com/ask-the-sports-doc/is-my-resting-heart-rate-too-low", "passage_text": "Dear Brett, A heart rate of 38 beats per minute (bpm) can be normal in a well-trained endurance runner at age 60. The heart rate normally lowers at rest. And distance running over four years could cause a reduction in resting heart rate from 60 bpm to 38 bpm.

For children ages 6 to 15, the normal resting heart rate is between 70 and 100 bpm, according to the AHA.

Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. For example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats a minute. To measure your heart rate, simply check your pulse. Place your index and third fingers on your neck to the side of your windpipe. Consult your doctor if your resting heart rate is consistently above 100 beats a minute (tachycardia) or if you're not a trained athlete and your resting heart rate is below 60 beats a minute (bradycardia) \u2014 especially if you have other signs or symptoms, such as fainting, dizziness or shortness of breath.

The fitter you are, the lower your resting heart rate is likely to be. For example, athletes may have a resting heart rate of 40-60 bpm or lower.

Your age adjusted max is 220 minus your age for men, 208 minus 82% of your age for women. The easy way is 220 minus your age, take away 20%. To be in the optimal cardio range, your heart rate has to be at 80% of your age adjusted cardio max. "}, {"url": "http://www.netfit.co.uk/fitness/test/resting-heart-rate.htm", "passage_text": "Remember to take your resting heart rate over at least 3 days so that you can get an average reading. For example if on day one you record 72 bpm (beats per minute) day two you record 78 bpm and on day three you record 72 bpm, then your average is 74 bpm. Look at recording your resting heart rate for a full minute to make the test as accurate as possible. As you become older, your heart rate decreases, with infants having the highest resting heart rates from 100 to over 160 beats per minute. Young children, under 10, have a resting heart rate range from 70 to 120 beats per minute. Adults generally have a resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute.
