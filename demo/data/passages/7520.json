Sinkholes (also known as dolines) are surface depressions formed by either: 1) the dissolution of bedrock forming a bowl-shaped depression, or 2) the collapse of shallow caves that were formed by dissolution of the bedrock. Permeable bedrock makes a good aquifer, a rock layer that holds and conducts water. If the ground water that flows through the underlying permeable bedrock is acidic and the bedrock is soluble, a distinctive type of topography, karst topography, can be created."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_karst_areas", "passage_text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Karst topography is a geological formation by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock, usually carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite, but also in gypsum.

Doline karst is the most widely distributed type of karst landscape. The landscape is dotted with sinkholes (dolines) which can vary widely in number and size. For the Sinkhole Plain in central Kentucky, there are approximately 5.4 sinkholes per square kilometer over a 153 square kilometer area.

Karst Is a Landscape. A karst landscape has sinkholes, sinking streams, caves, and springs. The term karst is derived from a Slavic word that means barren, stony ground. It is also the name of a region in Slovenia near the border with Italy that is well known for its sinkholes and springs. The term karst describes the whole landscape, not a single sinkhole or spring. A karst landscape most commonly develops on limestone, but can develop on several other types of rocks, such as dolostone (magnesium carbonate or the mineral dolomite), gypsum, and salt."}]
