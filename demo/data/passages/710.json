Lean manufacturing is used as a tool to focus resources and energies on producing the value-added features while identifying and eliminating non value added activities. We have one simple goal. However lean redefines waste. Traditionally waste has been viewed as an object. It is very easy to envision a barrel of scrap and identify it as waste. In lean manufacturing the term waste actually refers not to the physical material but rather the relationship of the resource to the end customer."}, {"url": "http://www.aleanjourney.com/2014/07/what-lean-is-not-10-things-that-are-not.html", "passage_text": "Lean manufacturing is not a head-count reduction system; instead Lean manufacturers understand employees on the shop floor know their work best.

Lean manufacturing is a comprehensive term referring to manufacturing methodologies based on maximizing value and minimizing waste in the manufacturing process. Lean manufacturing has evolved in North America from its beginnings in the Toyota Production System (TPS) in Japan. However lean redefines waste. Traditionally waste has been viewed as an object.

Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy derived mostly from the Toyota Production System (TPS) (hence the term Toyotism is also prevalent) and identified as lean only in the 1990s.
