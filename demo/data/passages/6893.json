That's why conservationists are so keen on the production of baby pandas-not just for more cuteness in the world, but to help the survival of the species. It's the same for pandas, except there's more at stake.

The giant panda is a highly specialized animal with unique adaptations, and has lived in bamboo forests for millions of years.

Pandas imbibe so little energy from eating bamboo that it affects their behavior, to the point that they socialize comparatively little and literally avoid walking up or down hills.

Pandas consume up to thirty pounds of bamboo shoots and leaves a day, with the logical result that they also poop on average forty times a day.
