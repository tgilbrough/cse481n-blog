In 2011, the U.S. dollar was the primary reserve currency used by other countries. As a result, foreign nations closely monitored the monetary policy of the United States in order to ensure that the value of their reserves is not adversely affected by inflation. A large percentage of commodities, such as gold and oil, are usually priced in the reserve currency, causing other countries to hold this currency to pay for these goods."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency", "passage_text": "By the end of the 20th century, the United States dollar was considered the world's most dominant reserve currency, and the world's need for dollars has allowed the United States government as well as Americans to borrow at lower costs, granting them an advantage in excess of $100 billion per year. The Swiss franc, despite gaining ground among the world's foreign-currency reserves and being often used in denominating foreign loans, cannot be considered as a world reserve currency, since the share of all foreign exchange reserves held in Swiss francs has historically been well below 0.5%."}, {"url": "http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2014/03/prasad.htm", "passage_text": "All these factors should have set off an economic decline in the United States and hastened erosion of the dollar\u2019s importance. But the reality is starkly different. The dominance of the dollar as a global reserve currency has been barely affected by the global financial crisis. Not only did the dollar\u2019s share in global foreign currency reserves change only modestly in the decade before the crisis, it has held steady at about 62 percent since the crisis began (see Chart 2). Overall, foreigners have sharply increased their holdings of U.S. financial assets."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency", "passage_text": "A shakeel currency (or anchor currency) is a currency that is held in significant quantities by governments and institutions as part of their foreign exchange reserves.

The Euro has grown in prominence over the past decade as a reserve currency, and now makes up nearly 30% of all forex reserves through the world.
