Colistin is a polymyxin E antibiotic administered as the prodrug colistimethate which was originally introduced in the late 1950\u2019s. 1 Colistin\u2019s association with adverse effects including nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicy led to a decline in use. "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colistin", "passage_text": "Colistin is a decades-old drug that fell out of favor due to its nephrotoxicity. It remains one of the last-resort antibiotics for multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter. Colistin sulfate is stable, but colistimethate sodium is readily hydrolysed to a variety of methanesulfonated derivatives. Colistin sulfate and colistimethate sodium are eliminated from the body by different routes."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymyxin", "passage_text": "Polymyxins B and E (also known as colistin) are used in the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. The global problem of advancing antimicrobial resistance has led to a renewed interest in their use recently. Polymyxin M is also known as mattacin.

The duration of treatment depends on the type of infection and may be 14 days in cases of pneumonia and/or bacteremia. Subsequently, the intravenous use of colistin was mainly restricted during the past 2 decades for the treatment of lung infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR), gram-negative bacteria in patients with cystic fibrosis [ 10 \u2013 12 ]."}, {"url": "http://the-medical-dictionary.com/colistin_article_2.htm", "passage_text": "Administration. Colistin is used as a sulphate or as sulphomethylated form, colistimethate. Colistin sulphate tablets are used to treat intestinal infections, or to suppress colon flora. Colistin sulphate is also used as topical creams, powders, and otic solutions. Colistimethate is used for parenteral administration, and also as an aerosol to treat pulmonary infections."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colistin", "passage_text": "Colistin has been used in combination with rifampicin, and there is in-vitro evidence of synergy, and the combination has been used successfully in patients.
