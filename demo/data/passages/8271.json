It's the inverse in the cerebellum, an evolutionarily ancient part of the brain that sits astride the brain stem. Several early studies found a glia to neuron ratio of about 1:1 in the cortex, for example, but one 1988 study found a glia to neuron ratio of 17 to 1 in the thalamus, a versatile pair of walnut-sized knobs near the middle of the brain."}, {"url": "http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-neurons-and-vs-neuroglia/", "passage_text": "These non-neuron cells of the nervous system are important to maintain the homeostasis as well as to form myelin.
