The smallest deep freezers offer 5 to 7.2 cubic feet of capacity. Energy Star models use 230 to 282 kilowatt hours of electricity each year, which translates to an annual operating cost of $24 to $30. You'll need 294 to 362 kilowatt hours of electricity to operate a chest freezer with 8.8 to 12.8 cubic feet of capacity. Expect to spend $31 to $39 to run these models for a 12-month period. Energy-Star models with 13 to 14.9 cubic feet have an annual energy use of 326 to 397 kilowatt hours"}, {"url": "http://homeguides.sfgate.com/much-run-freezer-per-month-67647.html", "passage_text": "Energy-Efficient Models. An energy-efficient large freezer with more than 25 cubic feet will use about 956 kilowatt-hours per year, according to EnergyStar.gov. That equates to about $10 a month. When you reduce the size of your freezer, your costs go down. Standard freezer sizes run between 19 cubic feet and 22 cubic feet. Small Chest Freezer. By buying an Energy Star unit built between 2001 and 2008, you can cut your energy costs for that same small chest freezer by less than half per month. A chest freezer sized below 16.5 cubic feet costs $53 per year, using a total of 404 kilowatt-hours per year, or 34 kilowatt-hours per month. When you divide $53 by 12, your monthly costs equate to a little more than $4 per month"}, {"url": "http://blog.gvea.com/wordpress/?p=933", "passage_text": "Total: $1,440. New fridge (Energy Star). Initial cost: $674. 5 years of electricity to operate it: $450. Total: $1,124. When shopping for a new fridge, keep in mind that top and bottom freezer models use 10 to 25 percent less electricity than side-by-side models (energystar.gov)."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100313124449AAbYVEr", "passage_text": "And since the minimum required efficiency of a new freezer rises every few years (along with the ENERGY STAR standard, which is always a cut above the base), a freezer from 10 or 20 years ago will most likely use more electricity. For example, I bought an ENERGY STAR freezer (10 cubic feet) almost 20 years ago. Answers. Best Answer: A 10 cubic foot chest freezer with an ENERGY STAR certification must use less than 315 kilowatt hours per year. Some models use as little as 282 kilowatt hours per year, which works out to about 0.77 kilowatt hours per day. A larger, 15 cubic foot ENERGY STAR chest freezer should use less than 400 kilowatt hours per year, while some use as little as 354 kilowatt hours a year, or just under 1 kilowatt hour a day"}, {"url": "http://energyusecalculator.com/electricity_freezer.htm", "passage_text": "Older freezers will use over 100% more energy than newer Energy Star rated models, a modern freezer will use between 100 and 400 watts of power, with 200 watts on average. Click calculate to find the energy consumption of a standalone freezer using 200 Watts for 24 hours a day @ $0.10 per a kWh. Cost Per Hour: Electricity usage of a Freezer. A standalone freezer is a box powered by electricity used to freeze food similar to a refrigerator freezer, standalone freezers typically provide more space than fridge freezers."}, {"url": "http://homeguides.sfgate.com/much-electricity-small-freezer-use-93871.html", "passage_text": "Upright Freezers. Upright freezers generally use more electricity than chest freezers. This is because hot air rises; when a chest freezer is opened, the cold air stays low and within the appliance, whereas with an upright, the cold air is replaced by room-temperature air. A new 17-cubic foot upright freezer with auto defrost uses an average of 684 kilowatt hours of electricity per year, explains Efficiency Vermont. A manual defrosting freezer uses just 480 kilowatt hours, which is about 22 percent less energy."}]
