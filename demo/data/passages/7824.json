The hippocampus is a small organ located within the brain's medial temporal lobe and forms an important part of the limbic system, the region that regulates emotions. The hippocampus is associated mainly with memory, in particular long-term memory. The organ also plays an important role in spatial navigation. Damage to the hippocampus can lead to loss of memory and difficulty in establishing new memories.

It's one of the phylogenetically oldest parts of the brain, and the first part chosen to be artificially replicated as a brain prosthesis.

Hippocampus: The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is involved in memory forming, organizing, and storing.

It is part of a system that directs many bodily functions: the limbic system. This system is located in the brain's medial temporal lobe, near the center of the brain. The hippocampus is involved in the storage of long-term memory, which includes all past knowledge and experiences. The hippocampus is not involved with short-term memory and procedural memory types (memory of how to do motor actions, like walking)."}]
