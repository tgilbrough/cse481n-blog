You also see people putting a big turkey in the oven frozen or somehow it thaws out in a couple hours, again only on TV does that seem to work. The truth is it takes days to thaw a 20 lb. turkey. 2-3 days in cold water (I thaw my turkey in a cooler) this is my preferred method."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Can_you_cook_your_turkey_overnight_at_200_degrees", "passage_text": "At 350 degrees you usually cook the turkey for 20 minutes per pound, but at the low temperature of 250 you'll need to cook it for 6 to 8 hours.

You must make sure that all the edges of the pan are covered so that the moisture will remain in the pan. This is the only tricky part to cooking a turkey like this.
