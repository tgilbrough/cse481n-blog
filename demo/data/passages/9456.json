By what you are describing it seems that you have is cataract and pre-retinal fibrosis. Retina is a membrane on the posterior part of the eye, on which image is formed of what we see. In other words, retina is the main visual part of the eye.

Its nasty first cousin is proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Premacular fibrosis (PMF) is another of several diseases that affects the macula, the center of the retina, the portion of the retina that provides the detailed vision that we use for reading, driving, and detailed work. The disease has its effects on the front side of the retina. Macular degeneration affects the underside of the retina. Although the symptoms are superficially somewhat similar, PMF is definitely not macular degeneration. It has a distinct mechanism of action, prognosis, and therapy."}, {"url": "http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/preretinal+macular+fibrosis", "passage_text": "If vision is significantly reduced, the main treatment is by vitreous surgery with removal of the layer of preretinal proliferative tissue.

Macular fibrosis is a condition also referred to as a macular pucker, epiretinal membrane, or cellophane maculopathy.
