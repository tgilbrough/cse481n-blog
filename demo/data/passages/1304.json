Titanite is frequently called by the name Sphene, which was the more popular term for this mineral prior to 1982. In 1982, the IMA adopted the official name as Titanite and discredited Sphene. The name Sphene is still frequently used, especially in Europe. Sphene also persists as the more prevalent name for faceted Titanite gemstones or transparent crystal forms. Titanite is known for its high luster and dispersion rate. Titanite is named for its titanium content. Its alternate name Sphene is named from the Greek term sphenos, which means wedge, in allusion to the typical wedge-shaped crystals exhibited by this mineral.

As a gemstone, titanite is usually some shade of chartreuse, but can be brown or black.
