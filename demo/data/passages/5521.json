Bacterial cells are very small-about 10 times smaller than most plant and animal cells. Most bacterial cells range in size from 0.2 to 10 microns or micrometers (0.0000079 to 0.00039 inches).

A bacteria is a single, self-contained, living cell. An Escherichia coli bacteria (or E. coli bacteria) is typical -- it is about one-hundredth the size of a human cell (maybe a micron long and one-tenth of a micron wide), so it is invisible without a microscope."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_does_the_size_of_the_average_bacteria_cell_compared_with_the_size_of_the_human_cheek_cells", "passage_text": "The size of a typical bacterial cell is 0.5-5.0 micrometers, a average human cell is 10 micrometers."}]
