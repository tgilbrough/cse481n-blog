Confidence votes 79. Nuclear membrane acts as a physical barrier, separating the nucleoplasm from the cytoplasm. It is a semipermeable membrane and allows transport of substances in and out of nucleus. Its inner membrane is involved in protein synthesis."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_does_a_nuclear_membrane_do_in_an_animal_cell", "passage_text": "Yes-both plant and animal cells have a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles.

A nuclear membrane, also known as the nuclear envelope, nucleolemma or karyotheca, is the double lipid bilayer membrane which surrounds the genetic material and nucleolus in eukaryotic cells. The nuclear membrane is punctured by thousands of nuclear pore complexes\u2014large hollow proteins about 100 nm across, with an inner channel about 40 nm wide."}, {"url": "http://biology.tutorvista.com/animal-and-plant-cells.html", "passage_text": "They are enclosed by plasma membrane and constitutes of membrane bound nucleus and organelles. Animal cells do not have cell wall. Due to the lack of the cell wall the size of the cell varies and the shape is irregular. Animal cells contain structures like centrioles, cilia and flagella and lysosomes. Cell membrane: All cells are covered by cell membrane. The components of animal cells are centrioles, cilia and flagella, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, microfilaments, microtubules,mitochondria, nucleus, peroxisomes, plasma membrane and ribosomes. There are many different cell types, approximately 210 distinct cell types in adult human body."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_does_the_cells_nuclear_membrane_do", "passage_text": "No animal cells do not contain nuclear membranes but plants cells do!

The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and like that structure, features numerous ribosomes attached to the surface. The other intermediate filament network is located on the outside of the outer nuclear membrane and is not organized in such a systemic way as the nuclear lamina. The amount of traffic that must pass through the nuclear envelope on a continuous basis in order for the eukaryotic cell to function properly is considerable."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_membrane", "passage_text": "The nuclear membrane consists of two lipid bilayers \u2014the inner nuclear membrane, and the outer nuclear membrane. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space, a region contiguous with the lumen (inside) of the endoplasmic reticulum. It is usually about 20\u201340 nm wide.
