When frozen, however, a thermoplastic becomes glass-like and subject to fracture. These characteristics, which lend the material its name, are reversible. History. Celluloid, which is considered the first thermoplastic, made its appearance in the mid-1800s and reigned in the industry for approximately 100 years. During its peak production, it was used as a substitute for ivory."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-thermoplastic.htm", "passage_text": "In fact, this is usually the case when a thermoplastic is being used for plastic injection molding or extrusion. The specific action of a plasticizer is to lower the material\u2019s glass transition temperature (Tg), which is the point it becomes brittle when cooled and soft when heated. Polycarbonate, a common type of thermoplastic, is used in eyeglass lenses. Polyethylene, one of the most common thermoplastics, is often used in shampoo bottles. A toy with thermoplastic parts.

These materials must conform to DMS-8240 and are classified by TxDOT in this specification as Type C. The temperature of the thermoplastic material is a very important factor in the performance of the thermoplastic-roadway surface bond. Suitable application temperatures range from 400\u2013450\u00b0F, with 420\u00b0F as the recommended temperature for most applications."}]
