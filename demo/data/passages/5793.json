The anticodon corresponds with the codon on the mRNA. In the process of translation during protein synthesis, the mRNA goes through a ribosome, and as it travels through, tRNA with the anticodon that matches each mRNA codon join. On the other end of the tRNA is an amino acid. Each anticodon codes for an amino acid. As each tRNA meets with its corresponding mRNA codon as the codon moves along the ribosome, the amino acids join one by one, eventually forming a polypeptide which is processed to become a specific protein."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_RNA", "passage_text": "An anticodon is a unit made up of three nucleotides that correspond to the three bases of the codon on the mRNA. Each tRNA contains a specific anticodon triplet sequence that can base-pair to one or more codons for an amino acid. One end of the tRNA matches the genetic code in a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon. The anticodon forms three base pairs with a codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis. The mRNA encodes a protein as a series of contiguous codons, each of which is recognized by a particular tRNA."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_difference_between_codon_and_anticodon", "passage_text": "A codon is the triplet sequence in the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript which specifies a corresponding amino acid (or a start or stop command). An anticodon is the corresponding triplet sequence on the transfer RNA (tRNA) which brings in the specific amino acid to the ribosome during translation. The anticodon is complementary to the codon, that is, if the codon is AUU, then the anticodon is UAA. There are no T (Thymine) nitrogen bases in mRNA.
