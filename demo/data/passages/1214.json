It is the process of removing DNA from one organism and inserting it into the DNA of another organism, giving it new traits. Recombinant DNA can be used to make crops resistant to pests or disease, it can be used to make livestock leaner or larger. In medicine, the technique can be used to develop drugs, vaccines, and to reproduce important human hormones and proteins. By engineering human DNA into a host organism, that organism can be turned into a factory for important medical products. Insulin production is an excellent example of the recombinant DNA process."}, {"url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21881/", "passage_text": "Joining DNA. Most commonly, both donor DNA and vector DNA are digested with the use of a restriction enzyme that produces sticky ends and then mixed in a test tube to allow the sticky ends of vector and donor DNA to bind to each other and form recombinant molecules. MESSAGE. Cloning allows the amplification and recovery of a specific DNA segment from a large, complex DNA sample such as a genome. Inasmuch as the donor DNA was cut into many different fragments, most colonies will carry a different recombinant DNA (that is, a different cloned insert)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA", "passage_text": "Construction of recombinant DNA, in which a foreign DNA fragment is inserted into a plasmid vector.

Recombinant DNA is the general name for taking a piece of one DNA, and and combining it with another strand of DNA. Thus, the name recombinant! Recombinant DNA is also sometimes referred to as chimera.. By combining two or more different strands of DNA, scientists are able to create a new strand of DNA. That's a very good question! rDNA stands for recombinant DNA. Before we get to the r part, we need to understand DNA. Those of you with a background in biology probably know about DNA, but a lot of ChemE's haven't seen DNA since high school biology."}, {"url": "http://www.iptv.org/exploremore/ge/what/insulin.cfm", "passage_text": "2. In 1973, two scientists named Boyer and Cohen developed a way to take DNA from one organism and put it in the DNA of bacterium. This process is called recombinant DNA technology. First, a circular piece of DNA called a plasmid is removed from a bacterial cell. Special proteins are used to cut the plasmid ring open.

We will introduce the different types of restriction enzymes, their advantages and disadvantages, and how they are used to create a recombinant DNA molecule. We will review how to make a recombinant genomic DNA library and how to use this library to find a specific gene. You will determine which restriction enzyme to use to create a desired piece of recombinant DNA, given specific DNA sequences. You will also learn the function of DNA ligase, understand how vectors are used, and learn how to construct a recombinant genomic DNA library."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA", "passage_text": "Recombinant DNA is widely used in biotechnology, medicine and research.
