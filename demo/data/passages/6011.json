Both thymosin \u03b1 1 and \u03b2-thymosins are intrinsically unstructured proteins, i.e. they lack a stable fold when free in aqueous solution. This structure, mostly alpha helix, was artificially stabilised by an organic solvent. The thymosin illustrated, originally named \u03b2 9 is the cow orthologue of human \u03b2 10. Thymosin \u03b2 4 induces the activity of the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in populations of thymocytes (thymus-derived lymphocytes). This suggests that the peptide may contribute to the maturation of these cells."}, {"url": "http://www.endocrineweb.com/endocrinology/overview-thymus", "passage_text": "Thymus Essentials. 1  The thymus gland, located behind your sternum and between your lungs, is only active until puberty. 2  After puberty, the thymus starts to slowly shrink and become replaced by fat. 3  Thymosin is the hormone of the thymus, and it stimulates the development of disease-fighting T cells.

Thymosins have diverse biological activities, and two in particular, thymosins \u03b1 1 and \u03b2 4, have potentially important uses in medicine, some of which have already progressed from the laboratory to the clinic. In relation to diseases, thymosins have been categorized as biological response modifiers."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-thymosin.htm", "passage_text": "10 hilariously insightful foreign words. A thymosin is a hormone-like substance that plays an important role in regulating the immune system. Discovered in the mid-1960s, it was originally found in the thymus gland, but has also been located in many different human and animal tissues. The thymus is found in the area of the chest that is between the lungs. Alpha and beta thymosins are used to detect the presence of autoimmune diseases and cancer. Thymosin was first observed in the thymus gland. High densities of thymosin beta 4 are found in blood platelets."}, {"url": "http://www.endocrineweb.com/endocrinology/overview-thymus", "passage_text": "1 The thymus gland, located behind your sternum and between your lungs, is only active until puberty. 2  After puberty, the thymus starts to slowly shrink and become replaced by fat. 3  Thymosin is the hormone of the thymus, and it stimulates the development of disease-fighting T cells.

The thymus serves a vital role in the training and development of T-lymphocytes or T cells, an extremely important type of white blood cell. The thymus is a soft, roughly triangular organ located in the mediastinum of the thoracic cavity anterior and superior to the heart and posterior to the sternum...."}, {"url": "https://eaware.org/thymus-gland/", "passage_text": "The thymus gland also produces a hormone called thymosin, which stimulates the T cells in the other lymphatic organs to mature. This gland also produces another hormone called thymopoietin, which is protein present in the mRNA (messenger RNA) and is encoded by the TMPO gene. Another function of thymus gland is to prevent the abnormal growth of cells, that may lead to cancer. The T lymphocytes travel from the bone marrow to the thymus gland where they remain until they get activated. After maturity, the lymphocytes enter the blood stream."}]
