It is then followed by 3 days of the 500 calorie diet after stopping the HCG. You then move onto Phase 3, which is also known as Maintenance. However, things don't always work out the way they are supposed to. Sometimes, for various different reasons, a person will have to cut the diet short. Absolutely not! It is never a good idea to do the HCG Diet for less than 23 days. Not only that, but 23 days is the minimum amount of time that the protocol allows. Some people believe that if they have lost a good amount of weight the diet is over-This couldn't be further from the truth."}, {"url": "http://www.hcgweightloss.com/hcg-injections-side-effects/comment-page-2/", "passage_text": "HCG is also used as a diet aid and this has drawn considerable attention to the possible HCG injection side effects (side effects of HCG shot) that may exist. HCG is presently relied upon as a medication for fertility and it is also used to safely promote the production of testosterone in males. However, the amount differences between HCG used for Weight Loss (125 IU to 200IU) and HCG for fertility purpose (10,000 IU) is significantly different. So there are rarely side effects reported while using HCG diet injections, or oral hCG for weight loss."}, {"url": "http://www.hcgdietdrops.com/hcg-injections-side-effects.html", "passage_text": "Remember that these are the side effects of HCG at the high doses used for fertility treatment. The side effects of HCG injections may be less serious due to the smaller dosage. The side effects of HCG drops and the HCG diet itself are also different. The side effects of HCG injections are potentially very serious and should not be taken lightly. These are NOT the same side effects as homeopathic HCG drops or the HCG diet itself. HCG stands for human chorionic gonadotropin."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/545952-how-to-quit-the-hcg-diet-early/", "passage_text": "The hCG diet restricts this number even further, recommending only 500 calories per day.

Exciting part, is that you can have any food you want as long as it is not a starch or carbohydrate for three weeks. Starches are such things as potatoes, chips, corn, rice, bread... you get the idea. If you are taking the natural homeopathic form of HCG, you listen to your body and determine when to quit. Say you have been losing an average of 6 pounds per week, and you notice that the last week or so, you have dropped to 4 pounds."}]
