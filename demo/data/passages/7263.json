Temperature and altitude are inversely proportional in the troposphere. This means that as one increases, the other decreases. Approximately 165 meters up in the troposphere is equivalent to a 1 degree Celsius drop. the relationship between atmospheric pressure and altitude is the higher you go, the lesser the atmospheric pressure becomes. if the air above you is less, then there is less \u2026 weight being pressed upon the air you are on. anonymous boy from small heath school y8 2011."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere", "passage_text": "The mesosphere (/\u02c8m\u025bso\u028asf\u026a\u0259r/ ; from Greek mesos middle and sphaira ball) is the layer of the Earth's atmosphere that is directly above the stratopause and directly below the mesopause. In the mesosphere temperature decreases as the altitude increases. The upper boundary of the mesosphere is the mesopause, which can be the coldest naturally occurring place on Earth with temperatures below 130 K (\u2212226 \u00b0F; \u2212143 \u00b0C). Within the mesosphere, temperature decreases with increasing height. This is due to decreasing solar heating and increasing cooling by CO 2 radiative emission.

The rate at which the temperature decreases, , is called the environmental lapse rate (ELR). The ELR is nothing more than the difference in temperature between the surface and the tropopause divided by the height. The tropopause is the boundary region between the troposphere and the stratosphere.
