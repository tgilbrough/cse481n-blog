That works out to an average compensation of $30 per passenger, which was a little crazy since I didn't have a single passenger who paid more than $25. I wound up working 50 hours, earning almost $600 in fares. And I actually made a lot more than that.

During absolute peak times, you can probably clear $30-$45/hr but that usually doesn\u2019t last longer than 1-2 hours. With that being said, I decided that I was ready to try out my first full Saturday night driving for both Lyft and Uber. It was actually my first full Saturday night in general ever since I normally do other things on Saturday nights.

Lyft drivers get paid on a weekly basis, and get paid an accumulation of their ride earnings from the previous week. The payment gets deposited directly into their bank accounts via an ACH transfer, and drivers must have an ACH transfer-compatible checking account to get paid. "}]
