Depending on their symmetry, animals share some general characteristics. Animals with radial symmetry have body parts that are arranged in a circular pattern around a central point, like spokes on a bicycle wheel. They do not have distinct front or back ends."}, {"url": "http://www.weegy.com/?ConversationId=C5DC93C4", "passage_text": "User: Many animals have body symmetry with distinct front and back ends.
