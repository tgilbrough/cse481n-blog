They make up the kingdom Archae, one of the main kingdoms of life. These organisms are difficult to classify because they have similarities to both normal bacteria and the larger eukaryotes. Archaebacteria are unicellular organisms that lack a nucleus. A type of extremophile, archaebacteria use chemical tricks to survive in harsh environments, such as volcanic lakes."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Is_true_bacteria_multicellular_or_unicellular", "passage_text": "unicellular organisms are the organisms which have one cell  it is also known as a single-celled organism.  example: Amoeba, Bacteria, Euglena, Paramecium,  Cyanobacteria e \u2026 tc.    Multicellular organisms are organisms that consist of more  than one cell. example man, bird, panda, parrot etc. Answer by DanAtwater. Confidence votes 173. Many bacteria are free-living unicellular (single celled) organisms, but many also form colonies of genetically identical individuals, and a few are multicellular. It is a common misconception that all bacteria are unicellular."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080508090021AAWK7lJ", "passage_text": "Best Answer: Eubacteria are unicellular, microscopic and can live nearly anywhere. I take it you are studying the 6 kingdoms, so remember this. Unicellular: Archaebacteria, Eubacteria and Protista. Multicellular: Fungi, Plantae and Animalia. Submit. \u00b7 just now. Report Abuse. Major characteristics of the eubacteria include: --all eubacteria are unicellular --microscopic --some can make their own food (autotrophs) while others rely on external sources of nutrition (heterotrophs) check out this one for more details http://facstaff.uww.edu/wentzl/eubacteri..."}, {"url": "http://danmarkltd.tripod.com/taxonomy/id6.html", "passage_text": "Chemotrophs get their food by breaking down inorganic matter. KINGDOM EUBACTERIA: Body type: unicellular Prokayotic / eukaryotic: prokaryotic Environments: extreme environments as do archaebacteria (near volcanic activity). HETEROTROPHS: This bacteria lives about anywhere, including in your body in the form of a parasite.

This group of bacteria-like organisms live in harsh (high temperature, salinity, etc.) environments similar to that of ancient earth (hence the name). They cell wall structure is different than that of typical bacteria. 2. Eubacteria --Prokaryotic, unicellular, nutrition mainly by absorption (heterotrophic) with some photo-or chemosynthesis (autotrophic) all single celled organisms with no membrane surrounding the genetic material (Bacteria, Blue-green algae) and circular DNA."}]
