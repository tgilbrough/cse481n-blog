I have a 6 yr old sta-rite pump that in the last two years has started to shut itself down when it gets too hot. I never noticed it doing this before. And it seems to overheat quite a bit. It will eventually turn itself back on as it cools down. Re: Average life expectancy of pump. Simple age isn't a reason for a pump to overheat. One thing to easily check is cooling. There is a fan that keeps air circulating to cool the field windings and since this is located outside it is possible critters got inside and made a home blocking some of the air passages."}, {"url": "http://www.improvementcenter.com/pools/swimming-pool-how-long-they-last.html", "passage_text": "Filter and pump.

I built my pool in 2000 and put in a 2 HP 2 speed Wisperflow. It is still going strong July 2014. I have 30,000 Gal pool. I run the pump 99 % on low speed. I have an Energy SMART power saver hooked up to low speed. It cut the current from 3.3 amps to 3.0 amps. The Hayward pool pump died about 14 months afterwards. The new one has lasted about 3 years and I suspect it is in big trouble. It is making very loud noises and now it won't start. I will be bringing it in tomorrow."}]
