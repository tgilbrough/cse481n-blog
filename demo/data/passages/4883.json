Useful for demonstrating many physiological phenomena and easily maintained in culture, Daphnia is an ideal animal for experimentation. Daphnia are filter feeders. The setose thoracic legs act as sieves for filtering algae, bacteria, and small particles of debris from the water. Daphnia transfer food to the mouth and grind it with mandibles before it moves through the gut for digestion.
