The pipe is in the form of a Venturi: it narrows in section and then widens again, causing the airflow to increase in speed in the narrowest part. To ensure a ready mixture, the carburetor has a float chamber (or bowl) that contains a quantity of fuel at near-atmospheric pressure, ready for use. This reservoir is constantly replenished with fuel supplied by a fuel pump."}, {"url": "http://auto.howstuffworks.com/question3771.htm", "passage_text": "1 A carburetor is essentially a tube. 2  There is an adjustable plate across the tube called the throttle plate that controls how much air can flow through the tube. 3  You can see this circular brass plate in photo 1. 4  At some point in the tube there is a narrowing, called the venturi, and in this narrowing a vacuum is created.

It is sometimes colloquially shortened to carb in North America or carby in Australia. To carburate or carburet (and thus carburation or carburetion, respectively) is to blend the air and fuel or to equip (an engine) with a carburetor for that purpose. Carburetors have largely been supplanted in the automotive industry by fuel injection. To ensure a ready mixture, the carburetor has a float chamber (or bowl) that contains a quantity of fuel at near-atmospheric pressure, ready for use.

Delivering gasoline to the carburetor Gasoline is delivered to the carburetor by the fuel pump and is stored in the fuel bowl. To keep this level of fuel stored in the bowl constant under all conditions a float system is used. A float operated needle valve and seat at the fuel inlet is used to control the fuel level in the bowl. If the fuel level drops below a certain level the float lowers and opens the valve letting more fuel in. When the float rises it pushes the inlet valve against the seat and shuts off the flow of fuel into the bowl."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/about_5082422_carburetor.html", "passage_text": "Significance.
