Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a chronic condition affecting the regulation of pressure that is most often seen after the onset of puberty.

OI describes a condition in which an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart after an individual stands up from a lying down position. In POTS, the lightheadedness or fainting is also accompanied by a rapid increase in heartbeat of more than 30 beats per minute, or a heart rate that exceeds 120 beats per minute, within 10 minutes of rising. The faintness or lightheadedness of POTS are relieved by lying down again."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postural_orthostatic_tachycardia_syndrome", "passage_text": "The hallmark symptom of POTS is an increase in heart rate by at least 30 beats per minute within 10 minutes of assuming an upright position. For people aged between 12 and 19, the minimum increase for diagnosis is 40 beats per minute. This symptom is known as orthostatic (upright) tachycardia (fast heart rate). Other symptoms of an orthostatic nature \u2014 occurring in response to upright posture \u2014 may accompany the tachycardia. The causes of POTS are poorly understood, and it is likely that several distinct underlying problems can lead to the symptoms of POTS."}, {"url": "http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30", "passage_text": "Diagnostic Criteria. The current diagnostic criteria for POTS is a heart rate increase of 30 beats per minute (bpm) or more, or over 120 bpm, within the first 10 minutes of standing, in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. 1,2,3,4 In children and adolescents, a revised standard of a 40 bpm or more increase has recently been adopted. While some of the physical symptoms of POTS overlap with the symptoms of anxiety, such as tachycardia and palpitations, POTS is not caused by anxiety. POTS patients are often misdiagnosed as having anxiety or panic disorder, but their symptoms are real and can severely limit a person's ability to function."}, {"url": "http://www.dinet.org/index.php/information-resources/pots-place/pots-symptoms", "passage_text": "POTS Symptoms.

To be diagnosed with PoTS, an individual must experience a group of symptoms in the upright position (usually standing) that are relieved by lying down.

The Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS) is an abnormality of the autonomic nervous system (sometimes called \u2018dysautonomia\u2019).
