According to the USDA the average family of four is spending somewhere between $544 to $1235 per month for food eaten at home. That\u2019s a huge range! They break it down into 4 plans: Thrifty, low-cost, moderate, and liberal. I found a few thrifty\u2019s, a lot of low-cost or moderates, and no one who admits to spending the liberal plan :-). So for the sake of argument I\u2019ll assume that the moderate plan is pretty average. The moderate plan for a family of four with small children is $855 per month. That is $7 a day for each person."}, {"url": "http://loweryourspending.com/average-cost-for-food-per-month-for-one-person.html", "passage_text": "According to the United States Department of Agriculture, Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, the average cost for food per month for one person in the United States is slightly over three hundred dollars ($300).

The USDA calculates average food costs at four different consumption levels: thrifty, low-cost, moderate-cost, and liberal. They assume that all meals and snacks are eaten at home, which lowers the cost. In June 2010, the thrifty plan for a family of 4 per week was $134.50. Low-cost = $175.10 Moderate cost = $219.10 Liberal cost = $265.90. In mud hut villages, in average, people use only 30 $/month for food. The average American family of four spends amount $100-200 a week on groceries. Though my family has personally spent up to $600 an week on groceries when splurging, on heavy meals, large amount of meat, sodas and snacks."}]
