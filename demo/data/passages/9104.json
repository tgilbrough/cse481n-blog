Young leave the nest almost immediately after hatching, and some young leave before all eggs have hatched. Young usually fledge at 6-7 weeks but may vary from 5-8 weeks. Young are independent at about 8-10 months at an average of 40 weeks. Many families stay together after the young can fly. Birds can breed in their first year."}, {"url": "http://www.hummingbirdsformom.com/dear_mom/the-gestation-period-of-hummingbird-eggs/", "passage_text": "The incubation period for hummingbird last usually between 16-18 days, but it can last as long as three weeks if the weather at the time is cooler then usual. The female hummingbird tries to maintain the temperature of the nest at about 96 degrees. So in general, the gestation period of hummingbird eggs is between two and three weeks, depending on the circumstances which are happening at the time. A hummingbird eggs will be white in color and only about the size of a pea or jelly bean."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-the-gestation-period.htm", "passage_text": "Incubation periods tend to be quite a bit shorter than the time it takes for gestation of comparably-sized mammals. A chicken, for example, has an incubation period of 20 days, and even larger birds like emus have incubation periods of only around 55 days.

Oftentimes, larger birds require longer gestation periods than smaller birds. For example, muscovy ducks -- one of North America's largest ducks -- require approximately 35 days for gestation, while smaller ducks have gestation periods of less than 30 days. Smaller perching birds, such as northern mockingbirds, have a gestation period of only 13 to 15 days. A smaller bird of prey, the red-tailed hawk, has a gestation period of 28 to 32 days, while the California condor needs at least 56 days for the gestating period.
