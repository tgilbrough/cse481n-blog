Voltage is electric potential energy per unit charge, measured in joules per coulomb (= volts).

Voltage has something to do with the electrical paths. In other words, the full amount of energy necessary to cause a minor electrical charge to move to the length of a path is the voltage between the end points of that same path. From the hydraulic analogy, voltage can be also be defined as the measure of an ability to do work. It can also be concluded that the more potential difference the larger the voltage or the ability to do a work will result. Voltage is measured using a device known as voltmeter."}, {"url": "http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/voltage", "passage_text": "A voltage produces an electrostatic field, even if no charge carriers move (that is, no current flows). As the voltage increases between two points separated by a specific distance, the electrostatic field becomes more intense. Voltage is symbolized by an uppercase italic letter V or E. The standard unit is the volt, symbolized by a non-italic uppercase letter V. One volt will drive one coulomb (6.24 x 10 18) charge carriers, such as electrons, through a resistance of one ohm in one second.
