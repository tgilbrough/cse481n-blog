About 70% of Namibia is savannah. In Central Namibia, thornbush-savannah is dominant with extensive grasslands and acacia bush. In the relatively humid Caprivi the dominant vegetation form is the woodland savannah, interspersed with single baobabs, wild figs and makalani palms.Not much grass grows in the arid south of Namibia.
