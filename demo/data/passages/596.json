On average, a standard model mini fridge uses roughly 230 kilowatt-hours per year, as much as many Energy Star rated full-sized refrigerators. The amount of energy a mini fridge consumes is due in large part to poor insulation and lack of cooling features. With the number of variables that factor into appliance energy consumption, it is difficult to predict how much energy a mini fridge may use.

For example, if a new refrigerator has a wattage of 300, multiplied by 730 hours, and divided by 1,000, it averages 219 kilowatt hours. Ad. The price of a kilowatt hour varies in the US, depending on location and peak usage times, but on average, one kilowatt hour costs about $0.06 USD. Newer appliances are generally built to be more efficient, and the location at which the appliance is placed also affects how much power the appliance will use; most new appliances include information regarding their average usage rate."}]
