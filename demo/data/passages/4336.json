In refrigerator freezers where temperature can be maintained at 0\u00b0F (-17\u00b0C) in the freezer cabinet, food may be kept for the same storage periods as in a freezer. Date food packages with an expiration date according to maximum storage time recommended if they are not date coded. In most refrigerators, with the control set for normal operation, the temperature in the general storage area is below 40\u00b0F (3\u00b0C). You can check the temperature in a refrigerator by placing a refrigerator thermometer at different locations in the cabinet. If the temperature is above 40\u00b0F (3\u00b0C), regulate the control to lower the temperatures"}, {"url": "http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3037c.pdf", "passage_text": "Temperature Log for Refrigerator \u2013 Celsius Page 2 of 3 DAYS 16\u201331 Monitor temperatures closely! 1.
