MCT Oil is an oil that is comprised of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). These medium-chain fatty acids have a aliphatic tail ranging from 6 to 12 carbon atoms.

Mct oil does not travel through the lymphatic system like other oils; it goes directly to the liver to be metabolized and released as energy. Mct oil acts like a carbohydrate (fuel for the body) to provide the necessary energy and calories, but not fat that can be stored by the body."}, {"url": "http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/issa23.htm", "passage_text": "MCT simply stands for medium chain triglycerides, as opposed to long chain triglycerides (LCT), which are found in most foods. MCT is comprised of primarily caprylic and capric fatty acids, and is a light-yellow, odorless, translucent liquid at room temperature. MCT oil occurs naturally in coconut oil and other foods. Supplementation with MCT oil began as a fat source to help treat diseases such as cystic fibrosis, obesity, and fat malabsorption. It has also been used to add calories to infant, and certain other formulas."}]
