Acetyl coenzyme A or acetyl-CoA is an important molecule in metabolism, used in many biochemical reactions. Its main function is to convey the carbon atoms within the acetyl group to the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) to be oxidized for energy production. Choline, in combination with acetyl-CoA, is catalyzed by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase to produce acetylcholine and a Coenzyme A byproduct."}, {"url": "http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Organic/acetylcoa.html", "passage_text": "Acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is an important biochemical molecule in cellular respiration. It is produced in the second step of aerobic respiration after glycolysis and carries the carbon atoms of the acetyl group to the TCA cycle to be oxidized for energy production. It is produced by decarboxylation of pyruvate in the matrix of the mitochondria."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration", "passage_text": "Cellular respiration is the set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. Although technically, cellular respiration is a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell due to slow release of energy from the series of reactions."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/493923-what-are-the-functions-of-coenzyme-a-in-cellular-respiration/", "passage_text": "Glycolysis is the first step in cellular respiration. It is the process by which cellular metabolism begins converting glucose, the main fuel used by the body obtained from starches and sugars, into usable energy. Glycolysis also produces some waste in the form of carbon dioxide, which is exhaled, and an acetyl group called pyruvic acid, which then joins with coenzyme A for the next step of cellular respiration.
