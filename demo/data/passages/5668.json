Make sure that you dry yourself. Many spa visitors enter the sauna wet, which is not ideal since the moisture evaporating from your skin cools the body. 2.) Stay calmly in the sauna: Relax and don\u2032t lift your feet over your head (which you could by lying down). Most of the saunas in Austrian spas will have 80 to 90 degrees Celsius. One session should last for 15 minutes. 3.) After the 15 minutes, open the door and let fresh air in. Most spas in wellness hotels have such facilities-in small saunas, you might have to use a cold shower for that purpose. 5.) Drink a lot to compensate the loss of liquids: Isotonic solutions are good for that, or fruit juices that are diluted with mineral water. 6.) Rest for at least 30 minutes."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_sauna", "passage_text": "Often after the sauna it is a custom to sit down in the dressing room or the porch of the sauna to enjoy a sausage, along with beer or soft drinks.
