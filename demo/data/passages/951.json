Some notable cocci bacteria include: Staphylococcus aureus: These bacteria are often found in the nose and on the skin, and about 20% of humans are carriers. It is capable of causing various minor skin conditions, and it can cause more serious infections, like pneumonia, meningitis, and toxic shock syndrome (TSS). The label cocci bacteria simply describes the shape of the bacteria, therefore it cannot be labeled as good or bad bacteria. Like all types of bacteria, some are commensal (meaning they are found in and on the human body without causing harm) while others are pathogenic (meaning they cause illness)."}, {"url": "http://www.microbeworld.org/types-of-microbes/bacteria", "passage_text": "Tags: Bacteria can be found virtually everywhere. They are in the air, the soil, and water, and in and on plants and animals, including us. A single teaspoon of topsoil contains about a billion bacterial cells (and about 120,000 fungal cells and some 25,000 algal cells). Some bacteria (along with archaea) thrive in the most forbidding, uninviting places on Earth, from nearly-boiling hot springs to super-chilled Antarctic lakes buried under sheets of ice. Microbes that dwell in these extreme habitats are aptly called extremophiles.

Some are heterotrophs (they eat other organisms) and others are autotrophs (they make their own food)."}]
