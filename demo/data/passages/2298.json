Now, just as there are a variety of glycosides, there are also several different varieties of saponins, each with slightly different properties. Of course, there are also instances where the repellent effects of saponins in quinoa are used. Perhaps the best example of this is the product Heads Up Plant Protectant, categorized by the US Environmental Protection Agency as a biopesticide, approved primarily as a treatment on potato seed pieces."}, {"url": "http://quinoabenefits.org/are-the-saponins-on-quinoa-dangerous/", "passage_text": "Here is some other information for you.

Saponins function as antinutrients and are frequently associated with plant lipids. They are not normally absorbed from the gut and have been shown to induce small intestinal damage or reduce intestinal absorption of nutrients (Jenkins 1988). Quinoa saponin is a known hemolytic when mixed with blood cells. In South America, saponin removed from quinoa is used as a detergent for clothing, washing and as an antiseptic to promote healing of skin injuries (D. Cusack pers. commun.; E.
