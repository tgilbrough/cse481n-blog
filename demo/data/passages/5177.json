Glutamate is a powerful excitatory neurotransmitter that is released by nerve cells in the brain. It is responsible for sending signals between nerve cells, and under normal conditions it plays an important role in learning and memory. "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory_synapse", "passage_text": "The excitatory neurotransmitters, the most common of which is glutamate, then migrate via diffusion to the dendritic spine of the postsynaptic neuron and bind a specific transmembrane receptor protein that triggers the depolarization of that cell. Glutamate is a small, amino acid neurotransmitter, and is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter at almost all synapses in the central nervous system. This molecule binds multiple postsynaptic receptors including the NMDA receptor, AMPA receptor, and kainate receptors."}, {"url": "http://www.minddisorders.com/Kau-Nu/Neurotransmitters.html", "passage_text": "Neurotransmitters can excite or inhibit neurons (nerve cells). Some common neurotransmitters are acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). Acetylcholine and norepinephrine are excitatory neurotransmitters while dopamine, serotonin, and GABA are inhibitory. Each neurotransmitter can directly or indirectly influence neurons in a specific portion of the brain, thereby affecting behavior.

The main excitatory neurotransmitters in the body are dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine and glutamate. Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain. It is very important in the reward system whereby we feel pleasure, achieve heightened arousal and do much of our learning. Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain. It plays key roles in cognitive functions like learning and memory. Imbalances in glutamate levels are associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, seizures and forms of autism."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory_synapse", "passage_text": "An excitatory synapse is a synapse in which an action potential in a presynaptic neuron increases the probability of an action potential occurring in a postsynaptic cell. Neurons form networks through which nerve impulses travel, each neuron often making numerous connections with other cells. Glutamate is a small, amino acid neurotransmitter, and is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter at almost all synapses in the central nervous system.

Adequate amounts of serotonin are necessary for a stable mood and to balance any excessive excitatory (stimulating) neurotransmitter firing in the brain. Excitatory neurotransmitters are not necessarily exciting \u2013 they are what stimulate the brain. Those that calm the brain and help create balance are called inhibitory.
