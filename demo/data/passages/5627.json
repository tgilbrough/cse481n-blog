DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) is a long stringy molecule that can be extracted from any biological material such as living or conserved tissues, cells and virus particles. A number of basic procedures are carried out to isolate and purify DNA. First the cell is broken open to expose its DNA. This is achieved by blending or grinding the cell. The next step involves breaking down and emulsifying the fat and proteins that make up the cell's membrane."}, {"url": "http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/research_methods/genomics/dnaext.html", "passage_text": "Simply put, DNA Extraction is the removal of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from the cells or viruses in which it normally resides.

However, they can be expensive to use routinely, so many labs have their own methods for DNA extraction.

DNA isolation is one of the most basic and essential techniques in the study of DNA. The extraction of DNA from cells and its purification are of primary importance to the field of biotechnology and forensics.

DNA isolation is a process of purification of DNA from sample using a combination of physical and chemical methods. The first isolation of DNA was done in 1869 by Friedrich Miescher.
