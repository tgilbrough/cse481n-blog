If there is a lot of invertebrates in the water, it may suggest that the water is clean. However, if there are hardly any then the water may be dirty and polluted. That's because invertebrates are sensitive to pollution. Hope that helped, brief but that's pretty much the answer. Polution kills them-so if there aren't any in some water then this suggests that the water may be poluted. By counting the number of each species of invertebrates in a waterway you can determine how polluted or not"}, {"url": "http://ogoapes.weebly.com/uploads/3/2/3/9/3239894/using_invertebrates_to_assess_water_quality.pdf", "passage_text": "The higher the pH, the more basic the solution. On the pH scale, a change of one unit is actually a ten-fold change. For example, pure distilled water is neural at pH 7. A solution at pH 6 is ten times more acidic than pure water, and a solution at pH 5 is 100 times more acidic than pure water. Thus, a pH change of one or two units can seriously affect a great number of organisms in an ecosystem. All organisms are adapted to survive within particular pH ranges. Most freshwater fish, for example, survive best within a pH range of 5.0-6.0. When acid precipitation falls into a lake, it lowers the pH of the water, thus killing many aquatic organisms. Indicator species are particular aquatic invertebrates that alert us to pollution problems in an environment"}, {"url": "http://insects.about.com/od/water-quality-monitoring/qt/Water-Quality-Monitoring-Using-Aquatic-Macroinvertebrates.htm", "passage_text": "Clean water is essential to life itself. Adverse changes to the water quality of one stream can impact all the bodies of water downstream \u2013 rivers, lakes, or even the ocean. When water quality degrades, changes to plant, invertebrate, and fish communities may occur and affect the entire food chain. Aquatic macroinvertebrates live in water for at least part of their life cycle. They include insects, worms, snails, mussels, leeches, and crayfish. For the purpose of assessing water quality, sampling is focused on benthic macroinvertebrates, those organisms that live at the stream bottom."}, {"url": "http://www.jdenuno.com/APBiology/APBioLabs/WaterQuality.doc", "passage_text": "Read the information in the text box to the left of the simulation.
