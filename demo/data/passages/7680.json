A heavy weight is placed on the ram. The inlet of the cylinder is connected to the pump, which continuously supplies water or the hydraulic fluid under pressure to the cylinder. It is a simple hydraulic device which stores energy in the form of fluid pressure. This stored pressure may be suddenly or intermittently released as per the requirement. In the case of a hydraulic lift or hydraulic crane, a large amount of energy is required when the lift or crane is moving upward."}, {"url": "https://www.tobul.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=27", "passage_text": "A hydraulic accumulator is a device in which potential energy is stored in the form of a compressed gas or spring, or by a raised weight to be used to exert a force against a relatively incompressible fluid. Pressure changes occur in a hydraulic system when the liquid is subjected to rising or falling temperatures. Also, there may be pressure drop due to leakage of hydraulic fluid. An accumulator compensates for such pressure changes by delivering or receiving a small amount of hydraulic liquid."}, {"url": "http://www.gpmhydraulic.com/WhatYouDontKnowAboutAccumulatorsCanKillYou.pdf", "passage_text": "Accumulators And Flow Controls Accumulators Hydraulic accumulators are used to storepressurized hydraulic fluid.

In energy-storage applications, a bladder accumulator typically is precharged to 80% of minimum hydraulic system pressure and a piston accumulator to 100 psi below minimum system pressure. There are four principal types of accumulators: the weight-loaded piston type, diaphragm (or bladder) type, spring type, and the hydro-pneumatic piston type. The weight-loaded type was the first used, but is much larger and heavier for its capacity than the modern piston and bladder types."}, {"url": "http://tractors.wikia.com/wiki/Hydraulic_accumulator", "passage_text": "15,631 pages on this wiki. A restored example of a 'Hydraulic Accumulator' in the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester. A 'hydraulic accumulator' is an energy storage device. It is a pressure storage reservoir in which a non-compressible hydraulic fluid is held under pressure by an external source. That external source can be a spring, a raised weight, or a compressed gas. The main reasons that an accumulator is used in a hydraulic system are so that the pump doesn't need to be so large to cope with extremes of demand, so that the supply circuit can respond more quickly to any temporary demand and to smooth pulsations."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_accumulator", "passage_text": "An accumulator enables a hydraulic system to cope with extremes of demand using a less powerful pump, to respond more quickly to a temporary demand, and to smooth out pulsations. It is a type of energy storage device. Compressed gas accumulators, also called hydro-pneumatic accumulators, are by far the most common type. A working example of this type of accumulator may be found at the hydraulic engine house, Bristol Harbour. The external accumulator was added around 1920. The water is pumped from the harbour into a header tank and then fed by gravity to the pumps."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_accumulator", "passage_text": "A hydraulic accumulator is a pressure storage reservoir in which a non-compressible hydraulic fluid is held under pressure by an external source.
