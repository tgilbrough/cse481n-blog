A significant human pathogenic bacterium, S. pneumoniae was recognized as a major cause of pneumonia in the late 19th century, and is the subject of many humoral immunity studies."}, {"url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123739445001747", "passage_text": "Haemophilus influenzae is a Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that remains a significant human pathogen.
