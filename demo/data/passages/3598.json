The term 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 refers to slabs of loin back ribs weighing 1-1/4 pounds to 1-1/2 pounds. 3-1/2 and down refers to slabs of spareribs weighing 3-1/2 pounds or less."}, {"url": "http://www.tmbbq.com/bbq-anatomy-101-the-other-kind-of-back-ribs/", "passage_text": "Baby back ribs of the pork variety are enormously popular, and therefore they fetch a nice price for retailers. Looking at the wholesale prices for this week (this price is lower than what you pay at the store), pork baby back ribs are selling for $2.38 per pound and boneless pork loin is just $1.33. When the meat is still on the hog, the baby backs and the loin are attached."}, {"url": "http://virtualweberbullet.com/ribselect.html", "passage_text": "Loin back ribs come from the loin of the hog, where pork chops come from. You'll sometimes see them called baby back ribs or loin ribs in the grocery store. They are small in size (1-1/4 to 2-1/4 pounds or more) and are less meaty, less fatty, and more tender than spareribs."}, {"url": "http://www.cooksinfo.com/baby-back-ribs", "passage_text": "A slab of baby back ribs will weigh 1 1/2 to 3 pounds (700g to 1 1/3 kg.) Slabs with less weight are considered better as they are from younger pigs. Baby Back Ribs don't have as much fat as spare ribs do. This lack of fat in them means they won't stand up to low and slow cooking, as other ribs can."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_much_do_Baby_Back_ribs_cost_at_the_grocery_store", "passage_text": "Depends on the store, of course, but it's around $10-12 per pound, uncooked.
