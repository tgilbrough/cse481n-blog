The expression shear flow is used to indicate: 1  a shear stress caused by torsion on a closed, thin-walled tube (in solid mechanics); 2  the flow induced by a force (in a fluid)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_flow", "passage_text": "In solid mechanics, the shear flow q in a closed, thin-wall tube is defined as the internal shearing force V per unit of length of the perimeter around a thin section. Shear flow has the dimensions of force per unit of length."}]
