The two types of transport proteins are channel and carrier protein. Transport is either active or passive. Active transport is moving molecules against the concentration gradient and energy is required in the form of ATP. Passive transport is moving molecules down the concentration gradient and no energy is required"}, {"url": "http://www.sparknotes.com/biology/cellstructure/cellmembranes/section2.rhtml", "passage_text": "page 1 of 2.

Proteins on the outer surface act as recognition molecules to help the organism recognize its own cells. 4.

They are one of the common types of protein along with soluble globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and disordered proteins. They are targets of over 50% of all modern medicinal drugs.

Transport proteins, the final type of integral protein, extend through the membrane and transport materials in and out of the cell. Some transport proteins actively move materials in and out of the cell, while other simply provide an opening for materials to passively move.
