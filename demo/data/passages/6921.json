Bacillus megaterium is a rod-like, Gram-positive, mainly aerobic spore forming bacterium found in widely diverse habitats. With a cell length of up to 4 \u00b5m and a diameter of 1.5 \u00b5m, B. megaterium is amongst the biggest known bacteria. The cells often occur in pairs and chains, where the cells are joined together by polysaccharides on the cell walls. In the 1960s, prior to the development of Bacillus subtilis, B. megaterium was the main model organism among Gram-positive bacteria for intensive studies on biochemistry, sporulation and bacteriophages. B. megaterium grows at temperatures from 3 \u00b0C to 45 \u00b0C, with the optimum around 30 \u00b0C. Some isolates from an Antarctic geothermal lake were found to grow at temperatures up to 63 \u00b0C. B. megaterium has been recognized as an endophyte and is a potential agent for the biocontrol of plant diseases."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_megaterium", "passage_text": "Bacillus megaterium is a rod-like, Gram-positive, mainly aerobic spore forming bacterium found in widely diverse habitats.

Overview: Bacillus cereus is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, rod-shaped, facultative anaerobic bacterium belonging to the Bacillaceae family of the Firmicutes (Figure 1). Most strains of B. cereus are motile, while only 4% are found to be non-motile. Like other members of the genus Bacillus, B. cereus can produce protective endospores. An endospore is a dormant, tough, and non-reproductive structure produced by certain bacteria from the Firmicute phylum. They are typically located at cells' centre and contain hydrophobic appendages."}, {"url": "https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Bacillus_megaterium", "passage_text": "Bacillus megaterium is a gram positive, endospore forming, rod shaped bacteria.
