The latitude range for rainforest climate is 15\u00b0 to 25\u00b0 North and South of the equator. The annual precipitation of a rain forest is greater than 150 cm. In only a month the rain forest receives 4 inches of rain.

Tropical rainforests are found closer to the equator where it is warm. Temperate rainforests are found near the cooler coastal areas further north or south of the equator. The tropical rainforest is a hot, moist biome where it rains all year long. It is known for its dense canopies of vegetation that form three different layers."}, {"url": "http://www.cotf.edu/ete/modules/msese/earthsysflr/rforest.html", "passage_text": "Tropical Rainforest The tropical rainforest is a hot, moist biome found near Earth's equator.

Tropical rainforests cover about 6% of the Earth's total land surface. They are mainly located around the belt at the equator.

A tropical rainforest gets about 150 cm of rain per year. It gets lots of rain because it is very hot and wet in rain forests. The hotter the air, the more water vapor it can hold. The water cycle repeats often along the equator. The main plants in this biome are trees. This is important because in the rain forest, some rain never gets past the trees and to the smaller plants and ground below. Trees in this climate reach a height of more than 164 feet."}, {"url": "http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/rainforest.htm", "passage_text": "Southeast Asian Rainforests.

Introduction: The tropical rainforest is earth\u2019s most complex biome in terms of both structure and species diversity. It occurs under optimal growing conditions: abundant precipitation and year round warmth. There is no annual rhythm to the forest; rather each species has evolved its own flowering and fruiting seasons"}, {"url": "http://kids.nceas.ucsb.edu/biomes/rainforest.html", "passage_text": "LOCATION: There are two types of rainforest biomes: temperate and tropical rainforests. Temperate rainforests are found along coasts in temperate regions. The largest temperate rainforests are on the Pacific coast in North America, stretching from Alaska to Oregon. Other temperate rainforests are found along the coast of Chile, the United Kingdom, Norway, Japan, New Zealand, and S. Australia. "}]
