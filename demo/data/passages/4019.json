Octal numerals can be made from binary numerals by grouping consecutive binary digits into groups of three (starting from the right). For example, the binary representation for decimal 74 is 1001010, which can be grouped into (00)1 001 010 \u2013 so the octal representation is 112.

The one that we typically use is called decimal. These number systems refer to the number of symbols used to represent numbers. In the decimal system, we use ten different symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The hexadecimal system is Base Sixteen. As its base implies, this number system uses sixteen symbols to represent numbers.

Octal notation represents data as base-8 numbers. Each digit in an octal number represents three bits. Similarly, hexadecimal notation uses base-16 numbers, representing four bits with each digit. Octal numbers use only the digits 0-7, while hexadecimal numbers use all ten base-10 digits (0-9) and the letters a-f (representing the numbers 10-15)."}, {"url": "http://www.tpub.com/neets/book13/53e.htm", "passage_text": "Base (Radix) As with the other systems, the radix, or base, is the number of symbols used in the system.
