Muda has been given much greater attention as waste than the other two which means that whilst many Lean practitioners have learned to see muda they fail to see in the same prominence the variation of mura (unevenness) and muri (overburden)."}, {"url": "http://rtdonline.com/BMA/MM/SevenWastes.pdf", "passage_text": "Be conscious of the waste.3.

Waste is defined as any activity that does not add value to the customer or that the customer is not willing to pay for. Waste occurs in every process and in organisation. No matter how effective or efficient a process may be, some level of waste is always present. Waste is equivalent to non-value add work and is the antithesis of that which is value adding. work and used to calculate process efficiency.

Most of the Lean tools, at their core, focus on reducing waste to improve flow. The seven wastes provide a systematic way to categorize problems and identify improvement priorities. When assessing a process, looking for the seven wastes helps Lean teams find more opportunities to streamline the flow of work."}]
