The RNA's are all formed from the DNA information in the genetic code. However, the RNA is not the blueprint for the DNA with one exception. That exception is viral RNA that uses reverse transcriptase to create complementary DNA which is incorporated into the host DNA. This process is used by HIV"}, {"url": "http://www.diffen.com/difference/DNA_vs_RNA", "passage_text": "1 Messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribes genetic information from the DNA found in a cell 's nucleus, and then carries this information to the cell's cytoplasm and ribosome. 2  Transfer RNA (tRNA) is found in a cell's cytoplasm and is closely related to mRNA as its helper. DNA's genes are expressed, or manifested, through the proteins that its nucleotides produce with the help of RNA. The information found in DNA determines which traits are to be created, activated, or deactivated, while the various forms of RNA do the work."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Which_type_of_RNA_functions_as_a_blueprint_of_the_genetic_code", "passage_text": "mRNA: Carries the genetic information from DNA to ribosome to be translated. tRNA: Carries the anticodon and amino acid to the ribosome. rRNA: Component of ribosome, assists \u2026 in protein synthesis.
