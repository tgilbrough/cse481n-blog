Dear Amanda, \u201cRecioto,\u201d as in \u201cRecioto della Valpolicella,\u201d refers to a dessert wine made from grapes that were dried on mats after picking. This process turns the grapes closer to raisins, concentrating the flavors. The wines are lovely and taste how you\u2019d expect raisins-turned-wine to taste, rich and sweet."}]
