Each mRNA encodes the information for a single protein and is much smaller in size compared to the DNA molecule. Transcription is the first of overall two protein synthesis steps. During transcription, the information encoded in the DNA is copied to a RNA molecule as one strand of the DNA double helix is used as a template."}, {"url": "http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/cellular-microscopic/dna4.htm", "passage_text": "\u00adDNA carr\u00adies all of the information for your physical characteristics, which are essentially determined by proteins. So, DNA contains the instructions for making a protein. In DNA, each protein is encoded by a gene (a specific sequence of DNA nucleotides that specify how a single protein is to be made). Specifically, the order of nucleotides within a gene specifies the order and types of amino acids that must be put together to make a protein. The particular sequence of amino acids in the chain is what makes one protein different from another. This sequence is encoded in the DNA where one gene encodes for one protein. The genetic code consists of 3-base words or codons that specify particular amino acids. The order of the codons designates the order of the amino acids in the protein.

Best Answer: 1) the sequence of the nucleotides along one strand of the DNA molecule. That one strand is called the sense strand and the genetic information is in the form of base pairings (i.e. A to T, G to C). Hope this helps. Please write back for more help.

DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid, and is where all genetic information is stored. Do not get this confused with RNA, or ribonucleic acid, because RNA does not store all genetic information, but only the information necessary to create proteins. Because DNA is a much stable molecule than RNA. However, in many viruses genetic information is encoded in their RNA.
