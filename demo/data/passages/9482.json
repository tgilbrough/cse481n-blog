To stop bleeding, a positive feedback response is initiated in which platelets in the blood accumulate and clot around the wound. This relatively quickly stops the cut from bleeding."}, {"url": "http://anatomyandphysiologyi.com/homeostasis-positivenegative-feedback-mechanisms/", "passage_text": "Positive feedback mechanisms. A positive feedback mechanism is the exact opposite of a negative feedback mechanism. With negative feedback, the output reduces the original effect of the stimulus. In a positive feedback system, the output enhances the original stimulus. A good example of a positive feedback system is child birth."}, {"url": "http://anatomyandphysiologyi.com/homeostasis-positivenegative-feedback-mechanisms/", "passage_text": "The control of blood sugar (glucose) by insulin is another good example of a negative feedback mechanism. When blood sugar rises, receptors in the body sense a change. In turn, the control center (pancreas) secretes insulin into the blood effectively lowering blood sugar levels."}, {"url": "http://anatomyandphysiologyi.com/homeostasis-positivenegative-feedback-mechanisms/", "passage_text": "Almost all homeostatic control mechanisms are negative feedback mechanisms. These mechanisms change the variable back to its original state or \u201cideal value\u201d. A good example of a negative feedback mechanism is a home thermostat (heating system)."}, {"url": "http://www.biologyreference.com/Ho-La/Homeostasis.html", "passage_text": "Negative Feedback and Stability. The usual means of maintaining homeostasis is a general mechanism called a negative feedback loop. The body senses an internal change and activates mechanisms that reverse, or negate, that change. An example of negative feedback is body temperature regulation."}, {"url": "http://anatomyandphysiologyi.com/homeostasis-positivenegative-feedback-mechanisms/", "passage_text": "The biological definition of homeostasis is \u201cthe tendency of an organism or cell to regulate its internal environment and maintain equilibrium, usually by a system of feedback controls, so as to stabilize health and functioning\u201d."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-relationship-between-positive-feedback-and-homeostasis.htm", "passage_text": "Ad. There are two types of homeostasis \u2014 positive feedback and negative feedback. Positive feedback and homeostasis is far less common than negative feedback. When negative feedback occurs, the body senses that a certain level is too high or too low and acts so the level moves in the opposite direction."}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/higher/biology/control_regulation/homeostatic_control/revision/1/", "passage_text": "Negative feedback is an important type of control that is found in homeostasis. A negative feedback control system responds when conditions change from the ideal or set point and returns conditions to this set point. There is a continuous cycle of events in negative feedback."}]
