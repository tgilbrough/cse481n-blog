We do not know the exact cause of optic disc drusen but they are thought to come from abnormal flow of material in optic nerve cells. Optic disc drusen are caused by an abnormal deposition of a protein-like material in the optic nerve. The cause of this material is unknown. In some individuals, the deposition of this material can be inherited, while in others it occurs without a family history."}, {"url": "http://www.glaucoma.org/glaucoma/the-optic-nerve-questions-and-answers-from-dr-bradley-schuster.php", "passage_text": "Its diameter is smaller than the diameter of the optic nerve.

Your optic disc is visible as a small circular area of your retina which can be seen by the ophthalmologist (eye specialist) or optician when they look into your eye. From your optic disc, the nerve fibres travel together in bundles, forming your optic nerve, to your brain.

Often, the optic disc has an unusual appearance, with multiple branches of the major blood vessels as they emerge on the disc. Multiple Branches of Blood Vessels As time passes, optic disc drusen can calcify and become more prominent.

There are approximately 1.1 million nerve cells in each optic nerve. The optic nerve, which acts like a cable connecting the eye with the brain, actually is more like brain tissue than it is nerve tissue. Optic atrophy of the optic disc (visible to an eye doctor looking inside the eye) is the result of degeneration of the nerve fibers of the optic nerve and optic tract.

Because there are no rods or cones overlying the optic disc, it corresponds to a small physiological blind spot in each eye. The ganglion cell axons form the optic nerve after they leave the eye. The optic disc represents the beginning of the optic nerve and is the point where the axons of retinal ganglion cells come together. The optic disc is also the entry point for the major blood vessels that supply the retina. The optic disc in a normal human eye carries from 1 to 1.2 million neurons from the eye towards the brain. The optic disc is placed 3 to 4 mm to the nasal side of the fovea. It is a vertical oval, with average dimensions of 1.76mm horizontally by 1.92mm vertically. There is a central depression, of variable size, called the optic cup."}]
