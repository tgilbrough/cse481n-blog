It is also called an erythrocyte or, rarely today, a red blood corpuscle. Red cells contain hemoglobin and it is the hemoglobin which permits them to transport oxygen (and carbon dioxide). Hemoglobin, aside from being a transport molecule, is a pigment. It gives the cell its red color (and name)."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_scientific_name_for_red_blood_Cells", "passage_text": "Answer by Betaclamp. Confidence votes 20.9K.
