Best Answer: Dear MamianG, A landform or physical feature in the earth sciences and geology sub-fields, comprises a geomorphological unit, and is largely defined by its surface form and location in the landscape, as part of the terrain, and as such, is typically an element of topography. A land form is an area that has been created through the progression of nature. For example, a mesa, mountains, glaciers, wetlands, islands, etc, etc...
