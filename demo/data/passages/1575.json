A light-bodied wine will have fewer tannins present and less presence on the palate. These wines tend to be less demanding partners with flavor-filled foods. An example of a light-bodied red wine would be one derived from the Gamay grape varietal, such as France\u2019s famed young red wine: Beaujolais Nouveau. Sometimes, you will hear of red wines referred to by their popular regional names.
