You can buy gesso readymade from any art supply shop. Gesso is very similar to white acrylic paint, only thinner. It dries hard, making the surface more stiff. Gesso prepares (or primes) the surface for painting, making the surface slightly textured and ready to accept acrylic paint. Without gesso, the paint would soak into the weave of the canvas. The word gesso is a noun, but many artists also use it as a verb. For example: You need to gesso your canvas before you paint..

If you have a canvas that has gesso on it, you will see it labeled either portrait or regular canvas. Gesso is a thick white pigment designed to cover untreated and unprimed canvas. The gesso has two purposes. The first is to cover the unprimed canvas so that the paint you apply does not bleed through the canvas.
