This is important because during the incubation period, your dog may act and appear normal. Vet visits and pre-purchase exams may reveal no signs of pending illness only to have parvo appear in a few days. The incidence of this disease in adult vaccinated dogs is now thankfully extremely rare. But parvo still kills puppies and non-vaccinated dogs. Here are a few key points about this disease."}, {"url": "http://www.future-of-vaccination.co.uk/canine-parvovirus-disease.asp", "passage_text": "Signs and symptoms.

Signs usually consist of depression, severe vomiting, refusal of food and water, abdominal pain and profuse smelly, bloody diarrhoea. Cause of canine parvovirus. The cause of canine parvovirus disease is a highly contagious DNA-containing virus. There are currently two types prevalent in the UK, namely CPV-2a and CPV-2b.

It first appeared in the late 1970s, and is one of the most frequent serious dog disease problems encountered in animal shelters. Parvovirus can be shed in the feces 3-4 days after infection with the virus, which is generally before clinical signs of illness appear. The virus will also be shed in the feces for approximately 10-14 days post-recovery from clinical signs of infection."}, {"url": "https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/Canine-Parvovirus-FAQs.aspx", "passage_text": "A: CPV-2c is the most recent variant of canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), the virus that causes parvo enteritis in dogs. There are several variants of CPV-2; all of the variants of CPV-2 are genetically related. CPV-2c differs from CPV-2a and CPV-2b at only one point on the DNA strand. A: CPV-2c causes similar signs as those seen with infection with CPV-2, CPV-2a and CPV-2b. These include loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea (which may be bloody), and dehydration. The bloody diarrhea might be mild or absent with any of the variants, but affected dogs are more likely to stop eating."}, {"url": "http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+2102&aid=467", "passage_text": "Canine parvovirus (CPV) disease is currently the most common infectious disorder of dogs in the United States.

The normal incubation period (time from exposure to the virus to the time when signs of disease appear) is from 7-14 days.

Veterinarians usually administer the CPV vaccine as part of a combination shot which includes, among others, the distemper, canine adenovirus, and parainfluenza vaccines.
