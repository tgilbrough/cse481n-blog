In general, Rh negative blood is given to Rh-negative patients, and Rh positive blood or Rh negative blood may be given to Rh positive patients. 1  The universal red cell donor has Type O negative blood type. 2  The universal plasma donor has Type AB"}, {"url": "http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-Positive-and-Negative-Blood-Types", "passage_text": "There are two major ways of distinguishing between blood types. The first is the ABO blood system, where the blood type is defined as either A, B, AB or O.

I'm not sure of the order if the mom's negative and the baby's positive blood type that could lead to issues. I think it's the mom being negative.

Positive is dominant and so the possible genotypes are ++ or +-, whereas for negative it can only be --. If the parent \u2026 s are both +- they can produce ++, +-, or --.
