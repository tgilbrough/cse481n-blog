A standard score of 90, the beginning of the average range, corresponds to a percentile rank of 25. A standard score of 110, the uppermost end of average, has a percentile range of 75. So a child at the 30 th percentile on a test of reading or math is performing within the region of what would be considered \u201caverage.\u201d. With percentile ranks and standard scores, the comparison group matters.

This means a score that falls at 50 or within 10 points above or below 50 is considered average, and typical of the population. The farther away from 50 a score falls, the more atypical it is. Each test tends to use their own classifications and ranges. Three percent of the population will fall in this range. On the other end three percent of the population is estimated to fall in the gifted or Superior range (130 and above).

There are several publishers of tests of cognitive abilities. An IQ score of 115 means performance one standard deviation above the median, a score of 85 performance one standard deviation below the median, and so on. Lewis Terman and other early developers of IQ tests noticed that most child IQ scores come out to approximately the same number by either procedure."}, {"url": "http://davidjcarey.com/Wechsler_Intelligence_Scale_for_Children.html", "passage_text": "The Verbal Scale, Performance Scale, and Full Scale scores are all Standard Scores. Previously I stated that standard scores all have 100 as their average, with the range of average being from 90 to 110. About two-thirds of all children will score between 85 and 115 on these three scales and scores within this range are not highly significant. Standard scores are also frequently reported following assessment.
