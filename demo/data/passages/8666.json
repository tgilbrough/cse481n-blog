Akabane (Ah-ka-bayne) is a viral disease spread by biting insects which affects ruminants, such as cattle, goats and sheep. The virus causes reproductive losses (abortions, stillbirths) and deformities of the offspring. Akabane occurs in parts of Australia and other tropical and subtropical areas. Akabane virus is transmitted by biting insects (vector). The true vector has not yet been identified, but mosquitoes and biting midges are the most likely suspects. Pregnant ruminants get the virus from the bite of infected insect; the virus is then spread to the offspring through the shared blood circulation."}, {"url": "http://five-element-treatments.blogspot.com/2011/05/usefulness-of-akabane-test.html", "passage_text": "The usefulness of the Akabane test.
