A newton = 0.102 kilogram force, which is the same force as 0.224 pound force. Weight is expressed in units of force.

The dyne is the cgs unit of force and is not a part of SI, while weights measured in the cgs unit of mass, the gram, remain a part of SI. In commercial and everyday use, the term weight is usually used to mean mass, and the verb to weigh means to determine the mass of or to have a mass of. Used in this sense, the proper SI unit is the kilogram (kg)."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=1006042704198", "passage_text": "On Earth one kilogram weighs 9.8 Newtons. In the English system, weight is measured in pounds. The English unit of mass is a slug, but most people who have not studied physics have never heard of a slug.

Answer     Unfortunately, the origi \u2026 nal answer is incorrect.     'Weight' is a force due to gravity and, therefore, is  measured in newtons in SI. Weight is measured using a spring  balance, calibrated in newtons. Because weight is affected by  gravity, an object of given mass will have a different weight,  according to where it is measured.     'Mass', on the other hand, is measured in kilograms in SI."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/In_what_units_is_weight_measured", "passage_text": "Since weight is force and force = mass*acceleration, the unit for weight is a unit of mass times a unit for acceleration. The SI unit for weight is in kg*m/s2, or Newtons (N) So your weight in Newtons would be your mass in kilograms multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity of the planet you are on. If you are on Earth, you would multiply your mass in kilograms by approximately 9.81, to get your weight in Newtons. Weight is expressed in units of force.

Mass is the amount of stuff in an object. That is, the amount of atoms and molecules present. Mass in science, is measured in the metric system using units such as kilogram (about 2.2 pounds)nwhich are a thousand grams, grams, centigrams (hundredths of grams), and milligrams (thousandths of grams). Mass is different from weight, Weight is a force.

The kilogram-force is a non-SI unit of force, defined as the force exerted by a one kilogram mass in standard Earth gravity (equal to 9.80665 newtons exactly). The dyne is the cgs unit of force and is not a part of SI, while weights measured in the cgs unit of mass, the gram, remain a part of SI. "}]
