Methylation of heavy metals can also occur outside of biological systems. DNA methylation in vertebrates typically occurs at CpG sites (cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites, that is, where a cytosine is directly followed by a guanine in the DNA sequence).

Methylation is one of the body s most important and most common chemical processes. It is the addition of a methyl group, or CH3, to many chemical compounds to change their solubility, or for other reasons that are explained below. Methylation is a key step in the formation of our enzymes and proteins. This process is called genetic transcription. It involves first making a copy of a section of DNA, which is a strand of RNA. This is the blueprint, as it were, for our proteins."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation", "passage_text": "In the chemical sciences, methylation denotes the addition of a methyl group to a substrate or the substitution of an atom or group by a methyl group.

Methylation, in particular, though, seems to affect certain systems more than others. One of the main systems is the brain and the production of neurotransmitters. With methylation defects, you see autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, all kinds of cognitive and behavioral issues, depression, anxiety, etc."}]
