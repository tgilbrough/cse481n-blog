A series of steps linking a mechanical or chemical stimulus to a specific cellular response. There are four types that we studied: g-protein linked reception; hormonal reception; receptor tyrosine kinase reception; pathways using second messengers (cAMP; calcium ions). second messenger. A small, nonprotein, water-soluble molecule or ion, such as a calcium ion (Ca2+) or cyclic AMP, that relays a signal to a cell's interior in response to a signaling molecule bound by a signal receptor protein."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_signal_transduction_pathway_and_regulation_of_blood_glucose", "passage_text": "Signal transduction is a mechanism in which the cell responds to a signal from the environment by activating several proteins and enzymes that will give a response to the signal. Feedback mechanism might involve negative feedback and positive feedback. Therefore, the process of insulin secretion is an example of a trigger mechanism in a signal transduction pathway because insulin is secreted after glucose enters the beta cell and that triggers several other processes in a chain reaction."}, {"url": "http://nrhs.nred.org/download.axd?file=1a34b325-d330-4fdf-87d0-ed5c1c395120&dnldType=Resource", "passage_text": "Cellular Response. \u2013 the final molecule in the signal transduction pathway will lead to a nuclear response and/or a cytoplasmic response within the cell.

A signal (such as a hormone or neurotransmitter) interacts with a receptor on the cell surface; this interaction causes a change in a second messenger (such calcium); and, eventually, a change is triggered in the cell's function (for example, the cell divides)."}, {"url": "http://www.flashcardmachine.com/ap-bio-ch11.html", "passage_text": "Definition. local signaling/regulators: local regulators are released by signaling cell and influence cells nearbygrowth factors: compounds that stimulate nearby target cells to grow and multiplyparacrine signaling:cell releases signal molecules that travel short distances to target cells. "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction", "passage_text": "Signal transduction occurs when an extracellular signaling molecule activates a specific receptor located on the cell surface or inside the cell. In turn, this receptor triggers a biochemical chain of events inside the cell, creating a response. Depending on the cell, the response alters the cell's metabolism, shape, gene expression, or ability to divide. The signal can be amplified at any step. Thus, one signaling molecule can cause many responses. Second messengers are the substances that enter the cytoplasm and act within the cell to trigger a response. In essence, second messengers serve as chemical relays from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, thus carrying out intracellular signal transduction."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction", "passage_text": "Signal transduction involves the binding of extracellular signaling molecules also called ligands to receptors that trigger events inside the cell. The combination of signaling molecule with a receptor causes a change in the conformation of the receptor, known as receptor activation.
