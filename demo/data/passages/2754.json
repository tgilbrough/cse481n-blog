Active volcanoes generally occur close to the major tectonic plate boundaries. Many are located along the Earth's plate boundaries. Active volcanoes are rare in Australia because there are no plate boundaries on this continent. However, there are two active volcanoes located 4000 kilometres south west of Perth on the Australian territories, Heard Island and the nearby McDonald Islands.

Most of the volcanic eruptions that make the news, such as the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption, take place near subduction zones. This type of volcano is represented by green triangles in Figure 2.

The most volcanism occurs at diverging plate boundary where plates separate. Volcanoes also form at converging plate boundaries where one plate dives beneath the other at subduction zones.

This happens at mid-ocean ridges. Plates move towards one another at convergent boundaries; one plate is forced below another in a process called subduction. Earthquakes and composite volcanoes are common at this type of boundary. Plates move past on another at transform boundaries. The most famous example of this type of boundary is the San Andreas Fault in California.

Earthquakes occur in plate boundaries because of the release of built up stress between the rocks constituting each plate, as they snap into a new position relative to each other, or fracture. Volcanoes usually occur along the boundaries of tectonic plates but they can also occur far from any boundary, over a 'hot spot'.
