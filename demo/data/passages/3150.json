Note that proline is a cyclic imino acid and its structure is shown in its entirety. Loops are very \ufb02 exible parts of the protein and often connect other secondary structure elements with each other. For example, loops often connect the portions of a polypeptide chain that form anti-parallel areas of parallel \u03b2 - sheets or form the links between different \u03b1 - helical and \u03b2 - sheet domains."}, {"url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20978961", "passage_text": "(1)BioUetikon Ltd, Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland. john.milne@biouetikon.com.
