There are two basic types of wave motion for mechanical waves: longitudinal waves and transverse waves.

Propagation of a transverse spherical wave in a 2d grid (empirical model). A transverse wave is a moving wave that consists of oscillations occurring perpendicular (or right angled) to the direction of energy transfer. If a transverse wave is moving in the positive x-direction, its oscillations are in up and down directions that lie in the y\u2013z plane. Light is an example of a transverse wave. With regard to transverse waves in matter, the displacement of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. A ripple in a pond and a wave on a string are easily visualized as transverse waves"}, {"url": "http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Sound/tralon.html", "passage_text": "Transverse Waves.

These are waves in which the particles in the medium move in a direction perpendicular to the path of the wave. Transverse waves travel well in solids, but not in fluids like liquid or gas. Longitudinal Waves. But not all waves are transverse waves. Sometimes, the wave medium oscillates parallel to the wave's direction. In these cases, the wave is called a longitudinal wave. Longitudinal waves are a bit challenging to imagine, so let's use a slinky for reference."}]
