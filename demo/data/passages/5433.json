All orchids have a petal that forms a lip. For the pollinator, the lip often serves as a landing pad of sorts.

Orchids are debatably the largest flowering plant family on Earth (30,000+ species).

Many decorative forms of orchids are grown specifically to be used as cut flowers. Despite being native to tropical regions, orchids actually don't need that much watering. For best results, water the plant every five to 12 days, depending on the type of orchid, the temperature it resides in and what time of year it is."}, {"url": "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/orchid", "passage_text": "Full Definition of ORCHID. 1. : any of a large family (Orchidaceae, the orchid family) of perennial epiphytic or terrestrial monocotyledonous plants that usually have showy 3-petaled flowers with the middle petal enlarged into a lip and differing from the others in shape and color. 2. : a light purple.
