In North America, totem poles are part of the cultures of many indigenous peoples of Alaska, British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest. Totem poles serve many purposes beyond their beauty, and their meanings are as varied as the cultures that make them. Some totem poles represent stories or important events. On these poles, each figure on the totem represents part of a story. These totems are used as a way to record the history and legends of the tribes. Figures on a totem pole are not gods to be worshipped. Instead, they represent traits and characteristics each clan or story embodies."}, {"url": "http://www.indians.org/articles/totem-poles.html", "passage_text": "Many Native American Indians expressed themselves with their artwork carved into totem poles.
