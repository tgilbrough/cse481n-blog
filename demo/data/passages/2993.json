The word jackalope is a portmanteau of jackrabbit and antelope, although the jackrabbit is not a rabbit, and the American antelope is not an antelope. Also, many jackalope taxidermy mounts, including the original, are actually made with deer antlers. Jackalope is a portmanteau word that combines two words, jackrabbit and antelope. However, the jackrabbit is not a rabbit, and the so-called antelope is not an antelope. Jackrabbits are actually hares rather than rabbits though both are mammals in the order Lagomorpha."}, {"url": "http://www.adirondackwildlife.org/GreatHornedOwls.html", "passage_text": "Then there is the great horned owl.

Indeed, the split two-horned system is only encountered in monotreme egg laying mammals and the lagomorphs (pika, hare and rabbit). The organ is held in place by a broad ligament that is anchored at 4 points under the vertebral column. As a rule, it is considered that a rabbit is adult and able to reproduce when it has reached 75 to 80% of its adult size. Female rabbits do not have an estrus (heat) cycle, as do other small animals like dogs or cats, but are called induced ovulators. Ovulation is spontaneous; it happens 9 to 13 h. after copulation."}, {"url": "http://www.wildlifeofct.com/great%20horned%20owl.html", "passage_text": "Great horned owls eat mammals such as rodents, rabbits and smaller owls.
