Britain's native tree flora comprises 32 species, of which 29 are broadleaves. Britain's industry and populace uses at least 50 million tonnes of timber a year. More than 75% of this is softwood, and Britain's forests cannot supply the demand; in fact, less than 10% of the timber used in Britain is home-grown.

This article attempts to establish some guidelines on growing apple trees and other fruit trees in the different climate regions of the UK. For commercial growers the UK is essentially a marginal climate. (The climate of Cornwall is surprisingly difficult for fruit trees, which is why well-adapted regional varieties such as Cornish Gilliflower remain popular). Growing fruit trees in this region is a little more of a challenge than in Zone 3 - but rest assured, still relatively straightforward."}, {"url": "http://www.twigs.org.uk/nativetrees.htm", "passage_text": "Some trees not native to the UK will be listed.
