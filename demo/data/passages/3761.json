It helps the body metabolize proteins. If the liver is damaged or not functioning properly, ALT is released into the blood. This causes ALT levels to increase. The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test is used to evaluate liver function. The test is also known as a serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) test or alanine transaminase test."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/303552-low-levels-of-alanine-aminotransferase/", "passage_text": "Liver function tests or LFTs are blood tests designed to determine how well your liver is working. The concentrations of several liver enzymes in your blood, including alanine aminotransferase, serve as good indicators of liver damage. High levels of alanine aminotransferase usually indicate a damaged liver. However, low levels may also be problematic and should be further correlated with other clinical data.

Guide. An alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test measures the amount of this enzyme in the blood. ALT is found mainly in the liver, but also in smaller amounts in the kidneys, heart, muscles, and pancreas. ALT was formerly called serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT). The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test is done to: 1  Identify liver disease, especially cirrhosis and hepatitis caused by alcohol, drugs, or viruses. 2  Help check for liver damage. 3  Find out whether jaundice was caused by a blood disorder or liver disease. 4  Keep track of the effects of medicines that can damage the liver"}, {"url": "http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2087224-overview", "passage_text": "Serum levels generally parallel the extent of damage. Another enzyme, alanine aminotransferase or ALT, is primarily found in the liver. AST and ALT are often measured together as part of a liver function panel to detect liver damage. Description. AST is an enzyme found primarily in the liver and heart, but it is also found in many other tissues including the muscle, red blood cells, pancreas, kidney, and brain. Damage to these organs or hemolysis releases the enzyme, resulting in elevated AST levels in the serum."}, {"url": "http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2087247-overview", "passage_text": "Reference Range. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme found primarily in the liver and kidney. It was originally referred to as serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT). Normally, a low level of ALT exists in the serum. ALT is increased with liver damage and is used to screen for and/or monitor liver disease.

It is also called alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and was formerly called serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) or serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT). ALT is found in plasma and in various body tissues, but is most common in the liver. It catalyzes the two parts of the alanine cycle. Serum ALT level, serum AST (aspartate transaminase) level, and their ratio (AST/ALT ratio) are commonly measured clinically as biomarkers for liver health. The tests are part of blood panels."}]
