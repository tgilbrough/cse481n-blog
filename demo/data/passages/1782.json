Little bridges over the gills that feed the early reaches of the river Wharfe can be found at Cray and Yockenthwaite. Crook Gill and Cray Gill have individual bridges and where they meet there is another bridge called Stubbing Bridge. Yockenthwaite is on the old packhorse route from Wensleydale to Ribblesdale and has a bronze age stone circle near by. Our first serious bridge over the Wharfe is at Hubberholme. It connects the church, (where JB Priestley\u2019s ashes were placed), to the George Inn and is on the old drover road from Lancaster to Newcastle. Getting greedy or functional, further down stream we have seven bridges in the parish of Linton."}, {"url": "http://www.goflyfishinguk.com/fly-fishing-locations/yorkshire-dales/river-wharfe.php", "passage_text": "The best of the fly fishing on the River Wharfe is in the Yorkshire Dales National Park above Bolton Abbey and within easy reach of Leeds, Bradford, Manchester, Harrogate and York.
