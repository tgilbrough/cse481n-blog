Even though Alto is not a voice type, mezzo-sopranos and alto are pretty much the same in range, but she is not a contralto (appropriate name for the lower alto part) because her tessitura (voice quality and sound) is not deep enough to qualify her as a contralto. 3.

In the lower and upper extremes, some mezzo-sopranos may extend down to the F below middle C (F 3) and as high as high C (C 6).

As you can see her range is very similar to that of the sopranos\u2019 and this is why range is never the sole means of categorizing a singer\u2019s voice. Most often a dramatic mezzo has the same range as a dramatic soprano, and what distinguishes her is that she sings more comfortably at a lower tessitura. While the dramatic soprano can sustain long notes in the higher register, the dramatic mezzo has more power in the middle and lower range."}]
