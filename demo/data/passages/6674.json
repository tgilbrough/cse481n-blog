[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker", "passage_text": "The circuit breaker must detect a fault condition; in low voltage circuit breakers this is usually done within the breaker enclosure. Circuit breakers for large currents or high voltages are usually arranged with protective relay pilot devices to sense a fault condition and to operate the trip opening mechanism. A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit."}, {"url": "http://www.acronymfinder.com/LSIG.html", "passage_text": "The World's most comprehensive professionally edited abbreviations and acronyms database.

LSIA is a term used primarily by Westinghouse/Culter Hammer. The LSI are the same as above. The A means that the ground fault function is an Alarm only and will not trip the brk. There is a Ground Fault LED that will light up if there is a ground fault on the system in excess of the setting. The breaker will not trip, just indicate an alarm. This style of ground fault is not used very much. Emergency systems, or processes where a non-orderly form of equipment shutdown is more dangerous than the ground fault itself.

What I have seen typically is that designers specify LSIG breakers once the service size/bus rating of the main swbd at and above 800A (@600V). However on smaller services (400A and below) - I dont usually see this being specified. We have sites with 30 amp and larger circuit breakers with LSIG.
