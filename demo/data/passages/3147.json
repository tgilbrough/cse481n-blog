There are only four types of nucleotides. This is one of the reasons why nucleic acids seem relatively simple compared to proteins. Each nucleotide has a sugar that forms a ring. Bonded to one part of this sugar is something called a phosphate group."}, {"url": "http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/basic-building-block-protein-called-6900.html", "passage_text": "The basic building block of a protein is called an amino acid. There are 20 amino acids in the proteins you eat and in the proteins within your body, and they link together to form large protein molecules."}, {"url": "http://condor.depaul.edu/mfiddler/hyphen/genefx-new.htm", "passage_text": "The combination of one of these nitrogenous bases, a sugar molecule, and a phosphate molecule is called a nucleotide -- the basic building block of the DNA molecule."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_building_blocks_of_DNA_and_RNA", "passage_text": "Nucleotides Nucleotides are the monomers, building blocks, of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).
