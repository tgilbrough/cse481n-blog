Basal ganglia disease refers to a group of physical dysfunctions that occur when the group of nuclei in the brain known as the basal ganglia fail to properly suppress unwanted movements or to properly prime upper motor neuron circuits to initiate motor function. Though motor disorders are the most common associated with the basal ganglia, recent research shows that basal ganglia disorders can lead to other dysfunctions such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome."}, {"url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21855979", "passage_text": "Comment in Cell. 2011 Sep 2;146(5):675-7.
