Thats only 36 grams per day. People don't need that much protein. Only 10-30 percent of total daily calories should come from protein. A bowl of rice and beans has enough protein to get you through one day. Its a myth that vegetarians don't get enough protein (as long as they eat a balanced diet). For healthy adolescents, the guideline is 1 gram for every kilogram of body weight (adults need less).
