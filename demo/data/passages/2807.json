See Also Custom Google Search for Fibrin Glue. Fibrin glue is a human-derived tissue adhesive that may be used for hemostasis and sealing of tissues. This biological glue can be manufactured from clotting factors taken from donor plasma (fibrinogen, cyroprecipitate and thrombin) or made intraoperatively out of fibrinogen coming from the patient's own blood*. The elastic property, tensile strength, and tissue adhesiveness of plasma fibrin glue or sealant has made it an important adjunct in microsurgical techniques, conventional hemostasis, cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, colostomy closure and splenic injury repair."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin_scaffold", "passage_text": "Fibrin glue or fibrin sealant is also referred to as a fibrin based scaffold and used to control surgical bleeding, speed wound healing, seal off hollow body organs or cover holes made by standard sutures, and provide slow-release delivery of medications like antibiotics to tissues exposed. A fibrin scaffold is a network of protein that holds together and supports a variety of living tissues. It is produced naturally by the body after injury, but also can be engineered as a tissue substitute to speed healing."}, {"url": "http://www.ethicon.com/healthcare-professionals/products/biosurgery/evicel-fibrin-sealant-human", "passage_text": "Indication.

The ingredients in these sealants interact during application to form a stable clot composed of a blood protein called fibrin. Fibrin sealants are also called fibrin glues. All fibrin sealants in use as of 2003 have two major ingredients, purified fibrinogen (a protein) and purified thrombin (an enzyme) derived from human or bovine (cattle) blood. Many sealants have two additional ingredients, human blood factor XIII and a substance called aprotinin, which is derived from cows' lungs."}, {"url": "http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/BloodBloodProducts/ApprovedProducts/LicensedProductsBLAs/FractionatedPlasmaProducts/UCM114073.pdf", "passage_text": "\u2022 EVICEL is a fibrin sealant indicated as an adjunct to hemostasis for use in patients undergoing surgery, when control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques (such as suture, ligature or cautery) is ineffective or impractical (1). \u2022 For Topical Use Only.
