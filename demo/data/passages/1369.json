A BTU, short for British Thermal Unit, is a basic measure of thermal (heat) energy. One BTU is the amount of energy needed to heat one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit, measured at its heaviest point. A unit of measure called the MMBTU is the equivalent of a million BTU's. Few man-made objects can generate this level of thermal energy, however. When shopping for heating or cooling systems, keep in mind that even the smallest window-mounted air conditioner or space heater can produce thousands of BTU's."}, {"url": "http://www.northcool.com/air_conditioner_size.html", "passage_text": "Btu \u2013 British Thermal Unit (Btu) is the international measure of energy. A Btu is the amount of heat needed to raise 1 (one) pound of water by 1(one) degree Fahrenheit. In HVAC industry, Btu's measure the quantity of heat a conditioning unit can remove from a room per hours. One BTU per hour is equal to 0293 watts. As the Btu rating increases, so does the weight, size and cost of the air conditioner."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_does_BTU_measure", "passage_text": "BTU is short for British Thermal Unit. 1 BTU is the heat required to raise 1 lb of water by 1 degF. So it is a quantity of heat, which is equivalent to a quantity of energy, in fact 1 BTu = 1.055 kilojoules, so 1 BTU/second = 1.055 kilowatts. This is called the mechanical equivalent of heat. If measuring heat, a BTU measures the amount of heat that is  required to raise the temperature of a pound of water to 1A\u00ba  1\u00e2\u00ba.
