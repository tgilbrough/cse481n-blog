Since magnesium burns in the presence of carbon dioxide, a CO2 fire extinguisher does not put out the flame from burning magnesium; a dry-chemical fire extinguisher must be used instead."}, {"url": "http://www.angelo.edu/faculty/kboudrea/demos/burning_magnesium/burning_magnesium.htm", "passage_text": "Burning Magnesium. Magnesium is one of the alkaline-earth metals, and is one of the most common elements in the Earth's crust. In its pure form, it is silvery white, and relatively soft. It burns in air with a brilliant white light, and for this reason is often used in flares and fireworks."}, {"url": "http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Under_Construction/Demonstrations/Burning_Magnesium", "passage_text": "Reaction. When magnesium is in its metal form it will burn very easily in air. However, in order to start the reaction (the burning) the magnesium metal needs a source of energy. The flame provides a source of heat so that the magnesium metal atoms can overcome their activation energy."}, {"url": "http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=2234", "passage_text": "2Mg + O 2. When magnesium burns, it is actually reacting with oxygen in the air and not with fire. Fire is what we call the heat and light produced when things burn. Magnesium reacts with oxygen to make a compound called magnesium oxide."}, {"url": "http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/33167/why-does-burning-magnesium-explode-when-sprinkled-with-water", "passage_text": "Magnesium reacts with water to produce hydrogen and a lot of heat. Metallic magnesium reacts only slowly, but magnesium vapour, produced when Mg burns, reacts extremely quickly due to the high temperature and efficient mixing, and produces heat very rapidly. Hence the explosion when water is added to burning magnesium."}]
