Humidity indicates the likelihood of precipitation, dew, or fog. Higher humidity reduces the effectiveness of sweating in cooling the body by reducing the rate of evaporation of moisture from the skin. Absolute humidity is the mass of the water vapor (), divided by the volume of the air and water vapor mixture (), which can be expressed as: The absolute humidity changes as air temperature or pressure changes."}, {"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060727002315AAokZBy", "passage_text": "I know there is an ideal room temperature where a human being will be most comfortable-it was mentioned in an episode of Star Trek Next Generation (sad I know) but I cannot remember what it is-over to you guys...
