Scientists have determined the temperature near the Earth\u2019s centre to be 6000 degrees Celsius, 1000 degrees hotter than in a previous experiment run 20 years ago. The layers of the Earth and their temperatures: crust, upper and lower mantle, outer core and solid iron core. Credit ESRF. The Earth\u2019s core consists mainly of a sphere of liquid iron at temperatures above 4000 degrees and pressures of more than 1.3 million atmospheres. Under these conditions, iron is as liquid as the water in the oceans"}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_temperature_at_the_center_of_the_earth", "passage_text": "The temperature on the Sun's surface (photosphere) is 6,000 degrees K.

The inner core is about 6,400 kilometers below the earths surface. the temperature at the inner core of the earth is at the high is about 7,000 degrees Celsius. But compared with the sun the earth's temperature at the center of the earth is only about the outer reign of the sun. The Earth can be divided into three large sections: the mantle, inner core, and outer core. The inner core is at the center of the earth. The pressure and temperature of the earth increases as one moves closer to the center. First comes the mantle, this is a layer that is bellow the crust of the earth. This is said to go down 2,900 kilometers; it's temperature is about 870 degrees Celsius"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_core", "passage_text": "The Earth's inner core is the Earth's innermost part and according to seismological studies, it is primarily a solid ball with a radius of about 1220 kilometers, or 760 miles (about 70% of the Moon 's radius). These considerations suggest that its temperature is about 5,700 K (5,400 \u00b0C; 9,800 \u00b0F). The pressure in the Earth's inner core is slightly higher than it is at the boundary between the outer and inner cores: it ranges from about 330 to 360 gigapascals (3,300,000 to 3,600,000 atm)."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/about_4660925_temperature-center-earth.html", "passage_text": "Sources of Heat. Scientists believe the earth\u2019s core get its heat from three sources: leftover heat from the planet\u2019s formation, friction and pressure from the outer layers, and energy from radioactive minerals.
