Many companies carry equipment \u2013 excluders, supers, feeders, etc. (Figure 1) \u2013 for five-frame nucs but not for three-or four-frame nucs. 1) Creating nucs is a good way to alleviate swarming tendencies in crowded colonies .Taking bees and brood from a colony to create a nuc is, in essence, a controlled swarm. The creation of nucs four to six weeks before the primary nectar flow alleviates the stress of growing colony populations in crowded colonies."}, {"url": "http://www.westnyackhoney.com/bees/what-is-a-bee-nuc/", "passage_text": "A Nuc on the other hand, is 4 or 5 frames from an existing hive. It is a colony that had been working well for a time and the bees know and are related to their queen. The frames contain honey and pollen and eggs and larva. The frames were pulled from a working hive. This is the nucleus of a hive. When you get bees, you can obtain your colony in two ways. First is with a Package. Package bees come in a screened cage the size of a shoebox. There are three pounds of bees (upwards to 10,000) in the package. There is a can of sugar syrup in the cage and a queen in a box."}, {"url": "http://www.westnyackhoney.com/bees/what-is-a-bee-nuc/", "passage_text": "A Nuc, pronounced nuke, is a nuclear hive.

It is typically a small wooden box with five frames in it. These frames compose everything that a young colony needs including a queen, honey and brood. A nuc is a really nice way to set up a new hive. All you do is transfer those five frames from the nuc into the hive. If you are getting a nuc and want to install it into your hive I have a tutorial with pictures right here: How to set up a beehive by installing a nuc. Setting up a beehive is not difficult."}, {"url": "http://www.honeybees4sale.com/NucsvsPackages.aspx", "passage_text": "Since both have an equivalent number of bees and a queen-it's not apparent why a Nuc at $160 is a better bargain than a package picked up for $95. It has to do with time and what's happening in the bees' season.. Spring is when colonies build-as temperatures grow warmer and pollen and nectar become plentiful, their inclination is to make a new colony. Packages, nucs and swarms all arrive about the same time in the southern Appalachians."}, {"url": "http://beekeeping.wikia.com/wiki/Nuc", "passage_text": "Feeding allows the worker bees to remain in the nuc, acting as nurse bees for developing brood.
