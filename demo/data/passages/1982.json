Grass type and climate determine the best season to dethatch and fertilize your lawn. Ideally, you would dethatch, water and fertilize your warm season grass -- such as zoysia or St. Augustine -- in early spring, and your cool season turf -- such as Kentucky bluegrass and fescue -- in early fall. Unfortunately, the aforementioned perfect world caveats apply to timing as well as watering. Certain types of grasses, such as zoysia and fine fescue, tend to produce dense thatch faster than others -- and a long, hot, dry summer can turn an entire lawn of even the most drought-tolerant grass to thatch."}, {"url": "http://www.brinly.com/project-seed-and-fertilize-your-lawn.html", "passage_text": "Step 3: Aerate.
