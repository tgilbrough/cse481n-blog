The answer is a little tricky because it depends on whether you are planning to buy pre-made solar panels or make them yourself. For premade solar panels, a single panel can cost about $900, or $12 per watt. A medium sized system to provide power to a small or very energy efficient house might cost $25,000 and a solar system to power a large house could cost $50,000+. The average installed system will cost $7-9 per watt. So, multiply the average hourly watt hours you need to generate that you got from the last step by something between $7 and $9 and that is what it will cost for solar panels with enough capacity to power your house.
