Best Answer: ATP & NADPH are made in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts during the light dependent stage of photosynthesis.

The light reactions and the Calvin cycle cooperate in converting light energy to the chemical energy of food: an overview. The equation for photosynthesis is a deceptively simple summary of a very complex process. Actually, photosynthesis is not a single process, but two, each with multiple steps. The reducing power is provided by NADPH, which acquired energized electrons in the light reactions.

In photosynthetic organisms, NADPH is produced by ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase in the last step of the electron chain of the light reactions of photosynthesis. It is used as reducing power for the biosynthetic reactions in the Calvin cycle to assimilate carbon dioxide. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, abbreviated NADP+ or, in older notation, TPN (triphosphopyridine nucleotide), is a cofactor used in anabolic reactions, such as lipid and nucleic acid synthesis, which require NADPH as a reducing agent. NADPH is the reduced form of NADP + ."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_does_ATP_and_NADPH_contribute_to_photosynthesis", "passage_text": "ATP: In the light dependent stage of photosynthesis the energy received from the sun is stored in the form of ATP, so ATP is simply an energy carrier for the reaction that takes place in the light dependant stage of photosynthesis.

NADP is a co enzyme which acts as a hydrogen carrier. The role of NADP is to carry the hydrogen atom from the light dependent stage, which comes from the water molecule (water molecule splits to form H+ , 2electrons & oxygen, which is a waste gas).

During the Light Dependent Cycle of photosynthesis, light is absorbed by the chlorophyll. The electrons are excited, which starts them moving from one enzyme to another. A hydrogen atom attaches itself to an NADP molecule, converting it to NADPH. Both the ATP and the NADPH are used to convert the carbohydrates created in the Light Dependent Cycle to C-C bond energy. This is done in the Light Independent Cycle, or the dark reaction cycle."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/facts_5799755_nadph-photosynthesis_.html", "passage_text": "Image by Flickr.com, courtesy of Duncan Hull.
