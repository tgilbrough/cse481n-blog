The term BIODIVERSITY was first coined by the entomologist E.O. Wilson in 1986. A neologism from biology and diversity, it refers to the variety of life on the planet. There is no single standard definition for biodiversity. 1. 1. Biodiversity may be defined as the totality of different organisms, the genes they contain, and the ecosystems they form. Biodiversity may be considered at three levels: genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity (see figure 1 below). Figure 1: Illustrations of various levels of biodiversity. back to top. Species diversity. - refers to the variety of living species within a geographic area."}, {"url": "http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Genetic_diversity", "passage_text": "Genetic diversity. Definition. noun. Genetic diversity refers to both the vast numbers of different species as well as the diversity within a species. The greater the genetic diversity within a species, the greater that species' chances of long-term survival. This is because negative traits (such as inherited diseases) become widespread within a population when that population is left to reproduce only with its own members."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity", "passage_text": "Genetic diversity is the total number of genetic characteristics in the genetic makeup of a species. It is distinguished from genetic variability, which describes the tendency of genetic characteristics to vary. Genetic diversity serves as a way for populations to adapt to changing environments. With more variation, it is more likely that some individuals in a population will possess variations of alleles that are suited for the environment. Those individuals are more likely to survive to produce offspring bearing that allele. The interdependence between genetic and species diversity is delicate. Changes in species diversity lead to changes in the environment, leading to adaptation of the remaining species. Changes in genetic diversity, such as in loss of species, leads to a loss of biological diversity."}]
