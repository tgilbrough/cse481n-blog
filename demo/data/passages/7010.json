To put it another way, the specific density of water itself would be 1.000. Ideally, urine specific gravity results will fall between 1.002 and 1.030 if your kidneys are functioning at a normal level. A urine specific gravity test compares the density of urine to the density of water. This quick test can help determine how efficiently your kidneys are diluting your urine. Urine that\u2019s too concentrated may indicate that your kidneys aren\u2019t functioning properly, or simply that you aren\u2019t drinking enough water."}, {"url": "http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2090711-overview", "passage_text": "Reference Range. Urinary specific gravity (SG) is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine.

Because urine is a solution of minerals, salts, and compounds dissolved in water, the specific gravity is greater than 1.000. The more concentrated the urine, the higher the urine specific gravity. An adult's kidneys have a remarkable ability to concentrate or dilute urine.
