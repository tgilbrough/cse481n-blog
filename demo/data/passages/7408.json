Stores of readily available glucose to supply the tissues with an oxidizable energy source are found principally in the liver, as glycogen. Glycogen is a polymer of glucose residues linked by \u03b1-(1,4)- and \u03b1-(1,6)-glycosidic bonds. A second major source of stored glucose is the glycogen of skeletal muscle. However, muscle glycogen is not generally available to other tissues, because muscle lacks the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase."}, {"url": "http://www.faqs.org/sports-science/Mo-Pl/Muscle-Glycogen-Recovery.html", "passage_text": "Most of the remaining glycogen in stored in the liver, where it is released into the bloodstream for transport to cells for energy production.

In humans, the most glycogen is found in the liver (10% of the liver mass), whereas muscles only contain a relatively low amount of glycogen (1% of the muscle mass). In addition, small amounts of glycogen are found in certain glial cells in the brain. Sometimes called animal starch for its resemblance with starch found in plants, it is stored in liver and muscle cells and can be converted to glucose if needed. Muscle has a much lower amount of glycogen per unit mass of tissue, but since the total mass of muscle is so much greater than that of liver, total glycogen stored in muscle is about twice that of liver. Stores of glycogen in the liver are considered the main buffer of blood glucose levels."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen", "passage_text": "Glycogen functions as the secondary long-term energy storage, with the primary energy stores being fats held in adipose tissue.
