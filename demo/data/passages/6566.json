Catechin is a powerful, water soluable polyphenol and antioxidant that is easily oxidized. Catechin reacts with toxins created by harmful bacteria (many of which belong to the protein family) and harmful metals such as lead, mercury, chrome, and cadmium.

Strictly speaking, 90% of tea polyphenols are catechins, so the two terms are almost synonymous. However, for reasons I do not yet understand, this word has been used interchangeably with green tea extract. A standardized green tea extract contains only about 30% catechins. However, what makes these catechins important is not their potency, but their abundance. About half of the catechin content of tea is EGCG. Just a small quantity of tea leaves will steep many cups of tea.
