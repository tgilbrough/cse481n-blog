These reflect light back into the camera lens, but they are too close to be in focus. A lens sees an out-of-focus point of light as a 'circle of confusion', and the more out of focus it is, the larger the circle. And orb photos are more common with digital cameras than film. This is not because of the digital recording device, but the compact optical design of the cameras, the short focal length and small aperture of the lenses and the close proximity of lens and flash."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orb_(optics)", "passage_text": "The term orb describes unexpected, typically circular artifacts that occur in flash photography \u2014 sometimes with trails indicating motion \u2014 especially common with modern compact and ultra-compact digital cameras.
