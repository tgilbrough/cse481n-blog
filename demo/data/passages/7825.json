Bring the liquid surrounding the brats to a strong simmer, then reduce the heat to medium. Simmer for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the centers of the brats are hot and steaming. Avoid bringing the liquid to a full boil, because it can cause the sausages to burst open and then dry out."}, {"url": "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/beer-brats-recipe.html", "passage_text": "Place brats in a Dutch oven with onions and butter, cover the brats with beer.

How long to grill bratwurst depends on how you grill them. You can throw them straight on the grill which will take about 25-30 minutes or boil the brats in beer, wine or water for about 20 minutes. After boiling, then they are grilled for 4-6 minutes."}]
