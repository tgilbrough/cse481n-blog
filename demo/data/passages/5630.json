If the fee is not paid by that due date, there will be a $15 late fee charged to your account. In the fifth year, instead of an annual statement, you will receive a recertification form in the mail. That form will bill you for your annual fee and tell you whether or not you have been selected for the mandatory audit. There may be a problem with the document that is not approved. In this instance, a Certification Department reviewer will contact you.
