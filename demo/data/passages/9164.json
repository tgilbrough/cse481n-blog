Venus rotates much more slowly than Earth does, so a day on Venus is much longer than a day on Earth. A day on Venus lasts for 243 Earth days or 5,832 hours! A day on Earth is 23.943 hours. "}, {"url": "http://www.windows2universe.org/kids_space/period.html&edu=elem", "passage_text": "All these things spin around a center point which we call an axis. This type of motion is called rotation, so the amount of time it takes an object to rotate is called a rotational period. It takes the Earth 23 hours, 56 minutes to rotate on its axis. We call the rotational period of Earth a day. Mars takes just a little longer to rotate, at 24 hours, 37 minutes. The Moon is much slower than either Earth or Mars. It takes over 655 hours for the Moon to turn just once on its axis--that's more than 27 days! Second, all the planets and moons in our solar system also move around other things.

In addition to rotational movement, the bodies in our solar system also move around, or orbit, other bodies. Planets orbit the Sun while moons orbit around planets. The amount of time required for a planet or moon to complete one orbit around another body is called an orbital period. On Earth, we call this orbital period a year. Our year is 365.256 days.

The period of this actual rotation is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles.
