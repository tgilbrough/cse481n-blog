Zoonotic organisms are those that can spread from animals to humans. There are more than 175 kinds of organisms that can cause zoonoses. They include viruses, bacteria, fungi, and such parasites as mites and worms. Many of the diseases that may be transmitted to humans from pets and farm animals are also found in wild animals.
