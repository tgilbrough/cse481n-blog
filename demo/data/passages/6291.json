[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "passage_text": "Genetics is the study of genes, heredity, and genetic variation in living organisms. It is generally considered a field of biology, but it intersects frequently with many of the life sciences and is strongly linked with the study of information systems. The father of genetics is Gregor Mendel, a late 19th-century scientist and Augustinian friar. Mendel studied 'trait inheritance', patterns in the way traits were handed down from parents to offspring. He observed that organisms (pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete units of inheritance."}, {"url": "http://johnhansenfitness.com/2013/09/05/casey-viator-a-genetic-phenomenon/", "passage_text": "Casey Viator \u2013 A Genetic Phenomenon.

All of these diseases have neurological symptoms. In order to have a deleterious effect, the number of repeats must cross a certain threshold. For example, normal individuals have between 5 and 30 CTG repeats within the 3' UTR of DMPK, the gene that is altered in myotonic dystrophy."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raynaud%27s_phenomenon", "passage_text": "In medicine, Raynaud's /re\u026a\u02c8no\u028az/ Disease or Raynaud phenomenon is excessively reduced blood flow in response to cold or emotional stress, causing discolouration of the fingers, toes, and occasionally other areas.
