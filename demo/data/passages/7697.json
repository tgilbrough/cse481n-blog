Think of a field's data type as a set of qualities that applies to all the values contained in the field and that determines what kind of data those values can be. For example, values that are stored in a Text field can contain only letters, numbers, and a limited set of punctuation characters. For example, a field whose data type is Text can store data that consists of either text or numerical characters, but a field whose data type is Number can store only numerical data. A field's data type determines many other important field qualities, such as: How you can use the field in expressions."}, {"url": "https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa716185(v=vs.60).aspx", "passage_text": "Data Types. Variables are placeholders used to store values; they have names and data types. The data type of a variable determines how the bits representing those values are stored in the computer's memory. When you declare a variable, you can also supply a data type for it. All variables have a data type that determines what kind of data they can store. By default, if you don't supply a data type, the variable is given the Variant data type. The Variant data type is like a chameleon \u2014 it can represent many different data types in different situations."}, {"url": "http://techterms.com/definition/datatype", "passage_text": "Data Type. A data type is a type of data. Of course, that is rather circular definition, and also not very helpful. Therefore, a better definition of a data type is a data storage format that can contain a specific type or range of values. When computer programs store data in variables, each variable must be assigned a specific data type."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type", "passage_text": "Data types are used within type systems, which offer various ways of defining, implementing and using them. Different type systems ensure varying degrees of type safety. Almost all programming languages explicitly include the notion of data type, though different languages may use different terminology.

A data type is an attribute that specifies the type of data that the object can hold: integer data, character data, monetary data, date and time data, binary strings, and so on. When two expressions that have different data types, collations, precision, scale, or length are combined by an operator, the characteristics of result are determined by the following: The data type of the result is determined by applying the rules of data type precedence to the data types of the input expressions."}, {"url": "http://techterms.com/definition/datatype", "passage_text": "Some common data types include integers, floating point numbers, characters, strings, and arrays.
