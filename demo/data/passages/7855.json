The gradations of cooking are most often used in reference to beef (especially steak and roasts) but are also applicable to lamb, pork, poultry, veal and seafood (especially fish). The whole meat and the center will also continue to cook slightly as the hot exterior continues to warm the comparatively cooler interior.
