Here's how thermal imaging works: 1  A special lens focuses the infrared light emitted by all of the objects in view. 2  The focused light is scanned by a phased array of infrared-detector elements. 3  The detector elements create a very detailed temperature pattern called a thermogram."}, {"url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/heat-seaker-thermal-imaging-camera-for-the-masses/#!", "passage_text": "tumblr.

What It Is Made Of The thermal imaging camera is constructed using certain heat and water-resistant materials. 2  These make it withstand rugged conditions and even fire hazards. 3  The camera comprises of an optical system, a detector, an amplifier and a signal processing device. 4  Completing it, is a wide display as well."}, {"url": "http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/thermal-imaging", "passage_text": "Here's a brief explanation of how thermal imaging works: All objects emit infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy emitted by an object is known as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it emits."}]
