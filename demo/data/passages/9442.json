A result of under 200 mg per dL (5.2 mmol/L) is ideal. A level somewhere between 200 to 239 mg per dL (5.2 and 6.2 mmol/L) is within the edge line of high-risk class. A normal HDL cholesterol is in between 40 and 49 mg per dL (1 and 1.3 mmol/L) for men. As for women, it is between 50 and 59 mg per dL (1.3 and 1.5 mmol/L)."}, {"url": "http://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/medicine/cholesterol-range.htm", "passage_text": "Tags: normal cholesterol levels, normal cholesterol range, cholesterol range, cholesterol levels chart, cholesterol numbers.
