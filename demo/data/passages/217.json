A baby will normally inherit one sex chromosome from the mother, and one from the father. A woman has two X chromosomes, so she can give either of her X chromosomes. The father can give either his X or Y chromosome. A girl baby will result if the final arrangement is XX, and a boy will result if it is XY. As you would expect, about half of the sperm cells contain an X chromosome, and half contain a Y chromosome. It is possible to have an abnormal number of sex chromosomes, however, this is extremely rare."}, {"url": "https://www.sharecare.com/health/fetal-development-basics-pregnancy/determining-sex-of-a-baby", "passage_text": "A Dr. Michael Roizen, MD, Internal Medicine, answered. Sperm dictates the sex of the fertilized egg. However, a lot of mutual factors contribute to gender, including as the egg's receptivity to the male's chromosomes. So if a couple has five girls, that doesn't necessarily mean it's the man's fault. In humans\u2019 the sex of the baby is determined by the sperm.
