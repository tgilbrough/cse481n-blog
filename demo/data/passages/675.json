Near the center, the Galactic disk thickens into the Galactic bulge. The disk is surrounded by a roughly spherical Galactic halo of old stars and star clusters. Our Galaxy, like many others visible in the sky, is a spiral galaxy. The halo can be studied using variable stars, whose luminosity changes with time. Pulsating variable stars vary in brightness in a repetitive and predictable way. Two types of pulsating variable stars of great importance to astronomers are RR Lyrae variables and Cepheid variables.

When a star of that type is discovered the brightness of it in the telescope can be used to determine it's distance. The dimmer it appears the farther away it is. It has even been used to determine the distance to nearby galaxies.

They are thus useful in determining distances to the globular clusters within which they are commonly found to a distance of about 200 kiloparsecs. This in turn allows us to determine the distance to such stars and is discussed in more detail on the next page.

Some stars are very useful for finding distances to clusters and to other galaxies because they have a known luminosity that is large, so they can be seen from great distances away. All of the RR Lyrae stars in a cluster have the same average apparent magnitude. In different clusters, the average apparent magnitude was different. This is because all RR Lyrae have about the same average absolute magnitude (=+0.6, or 49 solar luminosities)."}, {"url": "http://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach/education/senior/astrophysics/variable_pulsating.html", "passage_text": "Pulsating variable stars are intrinsic variables as their variation in brightness is due to a physical change within the star.

Best Answer: Cepheid variables are a class of bright, variable stars, with the property that the period of the variation is related to their absolute luminosity. So they can be used to determine the distance, by comparing the measured apparent luminosity, with the absolute luminosity as deduced from the period"}]
