A circulatory disorder is any disorder or condition that affects the circulatory system. Circulatory disorders can arise from problems with the heart, blood vessels or the blood itself.

As the heart beats, it pumps blood through a system of blood vessels called the circulatory system. The vessels are elastic tubes that carry blood to every part of the body. Arteries carry blood away from the heart while veins return it.

Peripheral vascular disease, also called PVD, refers to any disease or disorder of the circulatory system outside of the brain and heart. The term can include any disorder that affects any blood vessels. It is, though, often used as a synonym for peripheral artery disease. PVD is the most common disease of the arteries.

Heart disease, or coronary artery disease, occurs when the blood vessels that supply oxygen to the heart narrow and stiffen. Smoking, an unhealthy diet, stress, and a sedentary lifestyle all increase the risk of heart disease. A heart attack or stroke can occur if the condition is untreated. The blood vessels transport blood to and from the heart, the heart pumps oxygenated blood to the body, and the oxygen, gases, and nutrients exchange in the capillaries. Anything that affects the integrity of the tubing can impair the health of the circulatory system."}, {"url": "http://www.livescience.com/22486-circulatory-system.html", "passage_text": "The circulatory system is a vast network of organs and vessels that is responsible for the flow of blood, nutrients, hormones, oxygen and other gases to and from cells.
