Also, with a circumference of 24,000 \u2026 miles covered in 24 hours yields 1,000 miles per hour. 8 people found this useful. The circumference of the Earth is about 25,000 miles, and it rotates once about every 24 hours. Therefore, your answer would be about 25000 miles per 24 hours, which would be \u2026 about 1"}, {"url": "http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-fast-is-the-earth-mov/", "passage_text": "The earth rotates once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.09053 seconds, called the sidereal period, and its circumference is roughly 40,075 kilometers. Thus, the surface of the earth at the equator moves at a speed of 460 meters per second--or roughly 1,000 miles per hour.

The Earth rotates on its axis once each day. Since the circumference of the Earth at the Equator is 24,901.55 miles, a spot on the Equator rotates at approximately 1037.5646 miles per hour (1037.5646 times 24 equals 24,901.55) (1669.8 km/h)."}, {"url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2546864/How-fast-YOU-spinning-Earths-axis.html", "passage_text": "An object on the Earth's equator travels once around the Earth's circumference.
