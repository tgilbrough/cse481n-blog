VVI pacemaker is not sufficient when the ventricles are not able to beat together in the cases of congestive cardiac failure and then dual chamber pacemaker is required.

In the first half of the tracing, pacemaker stimuli at 60 beats per minute result in a wide QRS complex with a right bundle branch block pattern. Progressively weaker pacing stimuli are administered, which results in asystole in the second half of the tracing."}, {"url": "http://patient.info/doctor/Pacemakers-and-Pacing", "passage_text": "A pacemaker in VVI mode denotes that it paces and senses the ventricle and is inhibited by a sensed ventricular event.

The temporary pacemakers that we see in the MICU are made up of a control box and one single output wire leading to the inner wall of the RV (thus called a ventricular wire, or \u201cV-wire\u201d), and provide simple rate control by pacing the ventricles."}, {"url": "http://www.remedyland.com/2012/10/vvi-pacemaker.html", "passage_text": "The role of VVI pacemaker is that in the event that a heart is slowing down, or stop, sends an electrical impulse to the right ventricle and activates the heart. Electrical impulses from the right ventricle passes to the left ventricle and thereby runs the blood flow.
