A small amount (2 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose) is formed in the cytoplasm. The process is called glycolysis, and does not require oxygen. If oxygen is available, pyruvate formed during glycolysis enters the mitochondria and is there oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. The yield of ATP varies, but is probably a little below 30 molecules of ATP per glucose molecule. "}, {"url": "http://www.biology-questions-and-answers.com/cell-respiration.html", "passage_text": "2. ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, is formed after the binding of one phosphate molecule (phosphorylation) to one ADP (adenosine diphosphate) molecule. This is a process that stores energy in the produced ATP molecule. When ATP provides energy to the cellular metabolism, it releases one of its phosphate ions and ADP reappears. ADP can also release more phosphate ions and generate AMP (adenosine monophosphate) or even non-phosphorylated adenosine."}, {"url": "http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=2254", "passage_text": "First, we need to know what ATP really is-chemically, it is known as adenosine triphosphate. ATP is a usable form of energy for cells-the energy is trapped in a chemical bond that can be released and used to drive other reactions that require energy (endergonic reactions). First, there are the light reactions, where light is converted into chemical energy (a reduced electron carrier and ATP). This occurs in the thylakoids (stacked membranes) of the chloroplasts. The ATP and electron carriers are then used in a second set of reactions, called the light-independent reactions."}, {"url": "http://creationresearch.org/crsq/articles/36/36_1/atp.html", "passage_text": "Energy is usually liberated from the ATP molecule to do work in the cell by a reaction that removes one of the phosphate-oxygen groups, leaving adenosine diphosphate (ADP).

It is one of the end products of photophosphorylation, cellular respiration, and fermentation and used by enzymes and structural proteins in many cellular processes, including biosynthetic reactions, motility, and cell division. In plants, ATP is synthesized in thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis in a process called photophosphorylation. Here, light energy is used to pump protons across the chloroplast membrane."}, {"url": "http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/biology/mitochondria.html", "passage_text": "Mitochondria are the energy factories of the cells. The energy currency for the work that animals must do is the energy-rich molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The ATP is produced in the mitochondria using energy stored in food. Just as the chloroplasts in plants act as sugar factories for the supply of ordered molecules to the plant, the mitochondria in animals and plants act to produce the ordered ATP molecules as the energy supply for the processes of life. This ATP production by the mitochondria is done by the process of respiration, which in essence is the use of oxygen in a process which generates energy. This is a very efficient process for using food energy to make ATP."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Where_is_ATP_produced_within_a_cell", "passage_text": "ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a molecule that has 3 phosphate molecules attached to it.
