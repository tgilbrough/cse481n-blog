Instead I was told to pull it out before it grows or get a thick lawn. So thanks again. Anyway, I have a relatively large chickweed invasion. I tried pulling some out with a thatch rake and it seemed to thin it out, but I'm not sure if it just allowed the chickweed to grow better also.

The soil should then be aerated with an aerator or shovel. If using a shovel, place gashes in the ground at least two to three inches deep and every one or two square foot. Once you do begin to water, continue to do so each day for about two to three weeks. Any leftover chickweed should begin to die while new grass replaces it.

One of the most pesky winter annual weeds is common chickweed. Homeowners tend to overlook its germination in the fall and only notice its presence in the spring when it begins to grow vigorously in thin and bare spots of the lawn. By June, chickweed is on the down hill side of its life span and will die out when the days become hot. We are a very reactive society, however, and when we notice the chickweed, we have an overwhelming desire to do something right now. It\u2019s too late this year to go with pre-emergent herbicides.
