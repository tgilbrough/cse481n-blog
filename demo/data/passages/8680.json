Each side of the double helix runs in opposite (anti-parallel) directions.

When DNA is being replicated, it forms a replication fork that was created during the helicase process that separates the DNA strand. The strands that are separated are called the leading strand and the lagging strand accordingly. The leading strand is synthesized in the 5'-3' direction. In initiation, many replication proteins called initiators convert the DNA into a replication fork. This is accomplished first by the initiator proteins assembling around the DNA which causes melting of the dsDNA (double stranded DNA) origin."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110130182200AAVfZvX", "passage_text": "Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: The most widespread example of DNA replication in the real world is your zipper. It divides into two strands on unwinding and forms replication fork just like DNA does. And the same unwinded strands can be incorporated into the daughter DNA molecules and thus becomes semiconservative in nature. Source(s): .

As with DNA replication, partial unwinding of the double helix must occur before transcription can take place, and it is the RNA polymerase enzymes that catalyze this process. Transcription is the process by which DNA is copied (transcribed) to mRNA, which carries the information needed for protein synthesis. Transcription takes place in two broad steps. First, pre-messenger RNA is formed, with the involvement of RNA polymerase enzymes."}]
