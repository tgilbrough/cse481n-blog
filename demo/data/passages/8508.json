Volatile organic compounds, sometimes referred to as VOCs, are organic compounds that easily become vapors or gases. Along with carbon, they contain elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, sulfur or nitrogen. Indoors, products that contain volatile organic compounds release emissions when you use them, and to a smaller degree, when they are stored. You can be exposed to volatile organic compounds at home if you use cleaning, painting, or hobby supplies that contain them."}, {"url": "http://www.wildmintshop.com/learn/volatile-organic-compounds.asp", "passage_text": "Air Fresheners.

Other definitions may be found from government agencies investigating or advising about VOCs. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates VOCs in the air, water, and land. Anthropogenic VOCs are regulated by law, especially indoors, where concentrations are the highest. Harmful VOCs typically are not acutely toxic, but have compounding long-term health effects.

They are ingredients in many commonly used products and are in the air of just about every indoor setting. The table below shows some examples of products that contain VOCs. People spend most of their time indoors-at home, school and work. This makes the quality of the indoor air you breathe important. This fact sheet focuses on certain kinds of chemicals called volatile organic compounds or VOCs that are found in many products that we commonly use. It is designed to help you think about what VOCs may be present in your indoor air and steps you can take to reduce them"}, {"url": "http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/voc/", "passage_text": "While most people can smell high levels of some VOCs, other VOCs have no odor. Odor does not indicate the level of risk from inhalation of this group of chemicals. There are thousands of different VOCs produced and used in our daily lives. Most products containing VOCs will off-gas within a short period of time, although some will continue to give off VOCs for a longer period of time. Some steps you can take to reduce your exposure to VOCs in the home are: 1. Source control: Remove or reduce the number of products in your home that give off VOCs. Only purchase amounts of chemicals that you know you will use and carefully follow directions on product label"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound", "passage_text": "VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Most scents or odours are of VOCs.
