Recall from Chapter 4 that land plants face many challenges, including standing upright and supplying all their cells with food \u2026 and water. Like ferns, seed plants meet these two challenges with vascular tissue. The thick walls of the cells in the vascular tissue help support the plants. In addition, food, water, and nutrients are transported throughout the plants in vascular tissue. There are two types of vascular tissue. Phloem (floh um) is the vascular tissue through which food moves. When food is made in the leaves, it enters the phloem and travels to other parts of the plant.

Non-vascular plants are the simplest of all land dwelling plants. Their closest ancestor is the green algae, and like the green algae, they lack an internal means for transporting water. Also, non-vascular plants do not produce seeds or flowers. In terms of physical appearance, non-vascular plants typically only reach a height of one or two centimeters due to their lack of the woody tissue necessary for support on land. In addition, they are almost always found in damp, shady places."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080221232351AA2WPlx", "passage_text": "Best Answer: Size is not a criteria.
