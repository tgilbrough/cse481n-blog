Arteries can carry either oxygenated blood (e.g. aorta) or de-oxygenated blood (pulmonary artery). Artery simply refers to the direction in which blood is flowing. In this case, it means it is flowing away from the heart. Veins mean it is flowing toward the heart arteries carry blood away from the heart. To transport oxygenated blood though the system and into the veins to be oxygenated. The arteries' main functions are to carry blood (mainly erythrocytes, leukocytes, thrombocytes, and plasma) throughout the body. The blood carries oxygen, fights pathogens, clots blood, and maintains body temperature."}, {"url": "http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/cardiovascular_diseases/anatomy_and_function_of_the_coronary_arteries_85,P00196/", "passage_text": "The two main coronary arteries are the left main and right coronary arteries. Left main coronary artery (LMCA). The left main coronary artery supplies blood to the left side of the heart muscle (the left ventricle and left atrium). The left main coronary divides into branches: The left anterior descending artery, which branches off the left coronary artery and supplies blood to the front of the left side of the heart.

The oxygen rich blood is then returned to the heart via the pulmonary veins. Systemic arteries deliver blood to the rest of the body. The aorta is the main systemic artery and the largest artery of the body. It originates from the heart and branches out into smaller arteries which supply blood to the head region (brachiocephalic artery), the heart itself (coronary arteries), and the lower regions of the body"}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-are-arteries-function-definition-quiz.html", "passage_text": "The systemic division contains the aorta and all of its branches.
