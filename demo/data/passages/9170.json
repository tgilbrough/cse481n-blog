You should not listen to her problems because you will surely remain only a friend, you will be like her female friends. Instead you should tease her and what I mean by this is to make her laugh while maintaining a high status. Simply say to her You probably are not such a good kisser this will set a challenge in her mind, and women love challenges. This will do magic for her. Then tell her close your eyes and get closer to her like you would kiss her, but don't do it yet. Another magic move, that will make her desire you much more."}]
