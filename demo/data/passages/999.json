The Kuiper belt is a region between about 30 and 50 AU from the Sun in the plane of the ecliptic. It is believed to be where most of the trans-Neptunian objects are, including Pluto and several other recently discovered dwarf planets. It is also thought to be the origin of many of the solar system's short-period comets. There are several types of Kuiper belt objects, or KBOs.

This area of the solar system is large and difficult to assess as the objects in it are so far away and are, in general, quite small. There is some 20 to 200 times more mass in the Kuiper belt than in the asteroid belt.
