This is a pace between the collected and the medium trot, in which a horse, not yet trained and ready for collected movements, shows himself properly balanced and remaining \u201con the bit\u201d, goes forward with even, elastic steps and good hock action."}, {"url": "http://www.horseforum.com/english-riding/medium-working-trot-70511/", "passage_text": "Basicly the working trot is your horses natural trot (well when the horse is working in an outline) medium trot is a bit longer strides, a bit more swing through from the hind, more impulsion but NO more speed. I'm not very good at putting it into words."}, {"url": "https://ph.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080501133100AAjeplk", "passage_text": "For an extended or medium trot, you and your horse need to understand the principles of collection. An extension is really only a release of the energy built during a collected trot. For this and shoulder in, the horse MUST be coming through from behind and you must be containing that impulsion in your hand."}, {"url": "http://www.yourhorse.co.uk/Improve-your-riding/Search-Results/Riding-advice/Dressage/How-to-achieve-medium-trot/", "passage_text": "Medium trot is between working and extended trot, with some lengthening of the stride but staying rounder than the latter.
