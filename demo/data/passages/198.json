Histone acetylation and deacetylation are essential parts of gene regulation. The mechanism for acetylation and deacetylation takes place on the NH3+ groups of Lysine amino acid residues. These residues are located on the tails of histones that make up the nucleosome of packaged dsDNA. The process is aided by factors known as Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs)."}, {"url": "http://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-Acetylation.aspx", "passage_text": "1 Proteins that replicate DNA and repair damaged genetic material are created directly by acetylation. 2  Acetylation also helps in DNA transcription. 3  Acetylation determines the energy that proteins use during duplication and this determines the accuracy of copying the genes.

While 80-90% of eukaryotic proteins are acetylated in this manner, the exact biological significance is still unclear. Acetylation at the \u03b5-NH2 of lysine (termed lysine acetylation) on histone N-termini is a common method of regulating gene transcription. N-acetylation, or the transfer of an acetyl group to nitrogen, occurs in almost all eukaryotic proteins through both irreversible and reversible mechanisms."}]
