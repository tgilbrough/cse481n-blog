Pathology is the medical discipline that describes conditions typically observed during a disease state, whereas physiology is the biological discipline that describes processes or mechanisms operating within an organism. Pathology describes the abnormal or undesired condition, whereupon pathophysiology seeks to explain the physiological processes or mechanisms whereby such condition develops and progresses. Pathophysiology can also mean the functional changes associated with or resulting from disease or injury. Another definition is the functional changes that accompany a particular disease"}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_does_pathophysiology_means", "passage_text": "Thus, pathophysiology basically refers to the study of biological function during states of disease or dysfunction. For example, pathophysiology would explain kidney function when a person has diabetes. Most people study Human Physiology, and this is what it usually refers to in a college catalog.
