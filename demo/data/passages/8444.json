Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive neurological disorder that affects movement, muscle control, and balance. Parkinson\u2019s disease is part of a group of conditions called motor system disorders, which are associated with the loss of dopamine-producing brain cells. Parkinson's disease can seriously impair the quality of life in any age group. In addition to motor symptoms (motion difficulties, tremors) Parkinson\u2019s can cause various non-motor problems that have physical and emotional impacts on patients and their families."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/parkinsons-disease/ss/slideshow-parkinsons-overview", "passage_text": "While Parkinson's can be a frightening diagnosis, life expectancy is about the same as for people without the disease. For some people, symptoms evolve slowly over 20 years. Early treatment can provide years that are virtually symptom-free. About 5% to 10% of cases occur before age 50. Distinctive signs of the disease include tremors, stiffness, slowed body movements, and poor balance. Parkinson's was originally called a shaking palsy, but not everyone with Parkinson's has a tremor."}, {"url": "http://www.mayfieldclinic.com/PE-PD.htm", "passage_text": "Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive disorder that affects nerve cells deep in the brain responsible for planning and controlling body movement.

Part of the disease process develops as cells are destroyed in certain parts of the brain stem, particularly the crescent-shaped cell mass known as the substantia nigra.

Many people with early symptoms of Parkinson's disease assume their symptoms to be a normal part of aging. Symptoms of Parkinson's disease can also mimic symptoms of other diseases, disorders or conditions, such as depression, essential tremor, Huntington's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy ....
