The electron transport system is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria for animal, plant and fungus cells. The electron transport systemis also in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts in plant cells. Bacterial cells have molecules that are similar to the electron transport system found in eukaryotic (animal, plant and fungus) cells. These molecules are found in the bacterial cell membrane."}]
