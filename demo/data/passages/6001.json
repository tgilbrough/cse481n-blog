This property means that drugs that affect cholinergic systems can have very dangerous effects ranging from paralysis to convulsions. The acetylcholine molecules then bind to nicotinic ion-channel receptors on the muscle cell membrane, causing the ion channels to open.

In the peripheral nervous system, acetylcholine activates muscles, and is a major neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system. The acetylcholine molecules then bind to nicotinic ion-channel receptors on the muscle cell membrane, causing the ion channels to open.

It controls the contraction of all skeletal or voluntary muscles, for instance. It also affects the contraction of smooth and cardiac muscle. The effect of acetylcholine on cardiac muscle, however, is very different from its effects on skeletal or smooth muscle. In the heart, acetylcholine activation of muscarinic receptors causes channels in the muscle membrane to let potassium pass."}, {"url": "http://www.chemistryexplained.com/A-Ar/Acetylcholine.html", "passage_text": "Acetylcholine.

On the other hand, the muscles in the skeleton are activated by the peripheral nervous system. In the muscles of the skeleton, acetylcholine joins with acetylcholine receptors.

The rise in internal calcium suppresses the voltage-dependent inward calcium current. A third important effect is the opening of channels which cause depolarization of the membrane and so increase action potential discharge and contraction in the whole muscle. These channels were studied by voltage-clamp of single cells from longitudinal muscle of rabbit small"}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/373400-the-effect-of-acetylcholine-on-muscle/", "passage_text": "Acetylcholine\u2019s Effect On Smooth Muscle. Acetylcholine activates a different type of receptor present in smooth muscle: the muscarinic receptor. When this receptor binds acetylcholine, one result is the release of calcium ions from internal stores. The effect of acetylcholine on cardiac muscle, however, is very different from its effects on skeletal or smooth muscle. In the heart, acetylcholine activation of muscarinic receptors causes channels in the muscle membrane to let potassium pass."}]
