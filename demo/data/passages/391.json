By definition, a pathogen is a specific cause of a disease, while a non-pathogen is considered harmless. In reality, the distinction is not always clear. In 1890, the German physician Robert Koch formalized the criteria to classify bacteria as pathogenic. (See Koch's Postulates)."}, {"url": "http://www.aquapurefilters.com/contaminants/108/bacteria.html", "passage_text": "The most common non-pathogenic bacteria found in water is iron bacteria. Iron bacteria can be readily identified by the red, feathery floc that forms overnight at the bottom of a sample bottle containing iron and iron bacteria. Not all types of bacteria are harmful. Many organisms found in water are of no health concern since they do not cause disease. Biological contamination may be separated into two groups: (1) pathogenic (disease causing) and (2) non-pathogenic (not disease causing)."}, {"url": "http://www.actionbioscience.org/biodiversity/wassenaar.html", "passage_text": "Confusingly, certain bacteria can be beneficial to some animals, and pathogenic to others. More commonly, pathogenic bacteria are harmful only to a limited number of hosts, or even only to one, whereas they live happily within other hosts without causing trouble. Both viruses and bacteria can cause disease. However, not all types of viruses cause disease in humans, and not all bacteria cause disease. The majority of bacteria are harmless and some are beneficial. Another common misconception is that all bacteria are bad for you."}, {"url": "http://www.healthhype.com/microorganisms-types-harmful-effects-on-human-body-pictures.html", "passage_text": "Microorganisms can be, according to their characteristics, divided into several groups: 1  bacteria, viruses, certain fungi and parasites. 2  pathogenic (capable of causing disease), non-pathogenic, and opportunistic (causing disease when they have an opportunity, like in people with low immune system). Microorganisms, like certain bacteria and yeasts, living on the human skin or in the nose, mouth, throat, small and large intestine and vagina, are part of the normal human flora; they prevent overgrowth of harmful microorganisms. Some of these microbes, when overgrow, may become pathogenic, though."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "passage_text": "Although the vast majority of bacteria are harmless or beneficial, a few pathogenic bacteria can cause infectious diseases.

One of the bacterial diseases with the highest disease burden is tuberculosis, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which kills about 2 million people a year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.
