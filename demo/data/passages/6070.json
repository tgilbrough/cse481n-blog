As a fuel for home-heating furnaces and water heaters, propane is available across the United States. Delivered to the home and stored in a special tank, it's more cost-efficient to buy propane in the summer months when per-gallon prices drop. Heating with propane reduces greenhouse gas emissions and can help save on overall energy costs. No special furnace is required to heat with propane. Used in conjunction with a boiler or propane-powered water heater, radiant systems pump heated water through tubes embedded in the flooring. Radiant heat can be more efficient than using a central-heating system and ductwork."}, {"url": "http://www.which.co.uk/energy/creating-an-energy-saving-home/guides/home-heating-systems/lpg-central-heating/", "passage_text": "How LPG central heating works. LPG central heating is normally used in a \u2018wet\u2019 heating system where an LPG-fired boiler heats water, which provides central heating through radiators and hot water through the taps in your home. Some boilers designed for mains gas can be converted to use LPG. If you're one of the 4 million households that aren't connected to mains gas and you use LPG, then you need to read on.

National fuel prices from the U.S. Department of Energy show that the cost of electricity is more than twice the cost of propane. Compared with electric heat, propane is better in so many ways: 1  Propane is cheaper than electric: According to the U.S. Department of Energy, heating a home in the U.S. with propane in recent years has cost far less than heating with electricity."}, {"url": "http://www.homeheatingguide.co.uk/central-heating-cost.html", "passage_text": "Taking the increased boiler cost and additional tank installation an LPG central heating system can typically cost anything from \u00a32,500 - \u00a36,000 depending on the size of property.
