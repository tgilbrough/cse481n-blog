These professionals spend most of their time conducting research on certain elements of plant life. Biology and the organic nature of plant life is foundational, but the day-to-day work of an average plant physiologist involves a high degree of both chemistry and math. Physiologists study the internal workings of plants, often on a cellular level."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-plant-physiologist-do.htm", "passage_text": "Plant physiologists may work in biology, soil science, or agriculture.

Plant cells have a number of features that distinguish them from cells of animals, and which lead to major differences in the way that plant life behaves and responds differently from animal life.
