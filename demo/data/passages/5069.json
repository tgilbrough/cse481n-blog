Social Security has suggestions for the language in the fee agreements, but there are really only two main requirements. First, the amount of the fee cannot be more than the maximum that Social Security allows: the lesser of 25% of backpay or $6,000. For example, if your backpay award is $20,000, your attorney can collect $5,000 (25% of $20,000). Second, the agreement must be signed by the Social Security claimant and the attorney. If the claimant is a child, a parent should sign for the child. If the claimant is an adult with a guardian, the guardian should sign. Usually, copying and mailing costs in a case are not more than $100 - $200. While lawyers in Social Security disability cases cannot charge upfront fees for their time, they are allowed to charge a reasonable upfront fee to cover expected expenses in a case."}, {"url": "http://finance.zacks.com/attorney-fees-social-security-benefits-deductible-7413.html", "passage_text": "Prorating the Fee.
