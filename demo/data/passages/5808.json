The average age of diagnosis is around 62. A recent study found that 65% of people with Parkinson's onset under 20 years old and 32% of people with uonset between 20 and 30 had a genetic mutation that scientists believe increases the risk of Parkinson's. To the best of our knowledge, there are no genes that guarantee that you will develop Parkinson's."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/parkinsons-disease/news/20101004/parkinsons-later-diagnosis-earlier-death", "passage_text": "Most cases occur in people over the age of 60, but some people develop the disease much earlier in life, as was the case with actor Michael J.

Oct. 4, 2010 -- Parkinson\u2019s disease is not considered fatal, but people with Parkinson\u2019s have a shorter life expectancy than the general population.

More than 1.5 million Americans have Parkinson\u2019s disease, and each year 50,000 more individuals are diagnosed with the condition. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, five to 10 percent of the 50,000 are under the age of 50. (The average age for Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis is 60.) These patients have what\u2019s known as \u201cearly-onset\u201d or young Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, most people diagnosed with early-onset Parkinson\u2019s disease (and Parkinson\u2019s disease in general) have no family history or obvious risk factors. Researchers believe a combination of factors\u2014both hereditary and environmental\u2014combine to increase a person\u2019s chance of developing the degenerative disease."}, {"url": "http://nihseniorhealth.gov/parkinsonsdisease/whatisparkinsonsdisease/01.html", "passage_text": "One clear risk factor for Parkinson's is age.

However, about 5 to 10 percent of people with Parkinson's have early-onset disease which begins before the age of 50. Early-onset forms of Parkinson's are often inherited, though not always, and some have been linked to specific gene mutations. Diagnosis Can Be Difficult. About 60,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease each year. However, it's difficult to know exactly how many have it because many people in the early stages of the disease think their symptoms are due to normal aging and do not seek help from a doctor."}, {"url": "https://www.sharecare.com/health/parkinsons-disease-causes-risk-factors/what-age-parkinsons-disease-occur", "passage_text": "One clear risk factor for Parkinson's disease is age.
