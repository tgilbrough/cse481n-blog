[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alu_element", "passage_text": "An Alu element is a short stretch of DNA originally characterized by the action of the Alu (Arthrobacter luteus) restriction endonuclease. Alu elements of different kinds occur in large numbers in primate genomes. In fact, Alu elements are the most abundant transposable elements in the human genome. They are derived from the small cytoplasmic 7SL RNA, a component of the signal recognition particle. There are over one million Alu elements interspersed throughout the human genome, and it is estimated that about 10.7% of the human genome consists of Alu sequences. However, less than 0.5% are polymorphic (i.e. they occur in more than one form or morph)."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/arithmetic-logic-unit-alu-definition-design-function.html", "passage_text": "An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs. In addition to ALUs, modern CPUs contain a control unit (CU). The control unit tells the ALU what operation to perform on that data and the ALU stores the result in an output register. The control unit moves the data between these registers, the ALU, and memory."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_purpose_of_an_ALU", "passage_text": "Confidence votes 1.1K. ALU. Abbreviation of arithmetic logic unit, the part of a computer that performs all arithmetic computations, such as addition and multiplication, and all comparison operations. Logical operations-such as AND, OR and XOR is the fundamental ones, that all the others are derived from. An ALU loads data from input registers, an external Control Unit then tells the ALU what operation to perform on that data, and then the ALU stores its result into an output register. The Control Unit is responsible for moving the processed data between these registers, ALU and memory. 3 people found this useful."}, {"url": "http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/Functions-and-Utility-of-Alu-Jumping-Genes-561", "passage_text": "Indeed, part of what makes Alu elements so important is that they are found in nearly every human (and other primate) gene. These elements are spread throughout the genome and occur at varying densities in different loci. Exonization is the creation of a new exon from an Alu-containing (or any TE-containing) intron. (i.e., they are spliced out) . The process of exonization is illustrated in Figure 1. First, the Alu TE is inserted into an intron of a gene."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alu_element", "passage_text": "The Alu family is a family of repetitive elements in the human genome.

They possess the means for their own duplication and movement. Alu is a SINE-like element that is transcribed by RNA Pol III, and so a single DNA copy can make multiple RNA copies, each capable of inserting into DNA, so it's no wonder they have a very high copy number. My 2008 biology book (1) states that some 10% of the human genome consists of relatively short (~300 nucleotides long) Alu elements which do not code for proteins but many of which are transcribed into RNA."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/arithmetic-logic-unit-alu-definition-design-function.html", "passage_text": "A register is a small amount of storage available as part of a CPU.
