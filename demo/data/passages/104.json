So, pregnancy and breastfeeding are likely to delay the onset of the age of menopause. For example, let us assume that a daughter and her mother started menstruating when both of them were 12 years old. Taking birth control pills which prevent ovulation will also delay menopause. Birth control pills contain hormones that can block the process of oocyte maturation and ovulation. This will again prevent decrease in the number of oocytes in the ovaries."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/113484-delay-menopause/", "passage_text": "Menopause is the period in a woman's life when the ovaries stop releasing eggs and the uterus stops producing and expelling the lining that it makes monthly to support a fertilized egg. This means the end of monthly menstruation and a whole new slew of symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings and vaginal dryness. Menopause symptoms may come on slowly, although you have successfully delayed early onset menopause. Do not be ashamed of an occasional hot flash or mood swing.
