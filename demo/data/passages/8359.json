The EIA reports that in 2007, the average American home used 936 kilowatt-hours of electricity each month. East North Central and East South Central states consumed the largest amounts of electricity at well above 250,000 kilowatt-hours a month. Rising costs of electricity by local utility agencies might also help to lower consumption levels. For example, in 1995, the average retail price of electricity per kilowatt-hour to an American home was 8.4 cents. As of March 2009, the average cost was 11.58 cents for each home"}, {"url": "http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&t=3", "passage_text": "How much electricity does an American home use?

As an electrical engineer for a power company I see on average a house that is 1600-2000 square feet and having electric appliances except for the furnace use an average of 1500Kwatt-hours per month making 50 Kwatt-hours per day and a total of 18,000 Kwatt-hours per year.

The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010. Perhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates. In China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3."}]
