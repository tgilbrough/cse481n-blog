Your gas meter may record your gas consumption in hundreds of cubic feet, but your energy company is required to bill you in terms of kilowatt hours (kWh). Follow these steps: 1  Take the current reading of your gas meter and deduct the previous meter reading from it. 2  Take this result and multiply it by 2.83, to convert hundreds of cubic feet to cubic metres. 3  Multiply this result by a correction factor of 1.022640, and then by the value shown on your last gas bill."}, {"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091214152147AAx1ywM", "passage_text": "Best Answer: \u2022Multiply your units used by 2.83 to give you the number of cubic metres of gas used. (If you have a newer metric meter measuring gas in cubic metres you do not need to do this). \u2022Multiply by the temperature and pressure figure (1.02264). This value should be on your bill.

Whether you pay a standing charge or not, you will be able to work out how much your gas and electricity is costing. Your gas meter probably doesn\u2019t measure KWH\u2019s, so this gas calculator will convert your reading into KWH\u2019s using an average calorific value for the gas you have consumed. Below, you will find a list of the most common types of energy tariff. Just check on your gas and electricity bills for the type of tariff you are on: "}, {"url": "http://www.energylinx.co.uk/gas_meter_conversion.html", "passage_text": "Your gas meter will record your gas consumption in either cubic meters or hundreds of cubic feet. You will however pay for gas using a price per kWh. To convert your gas meter readings to kWhs feel free to use our free gas meter reading calculator.

Step 3. All energy bills are priced in kilowatt Hours (kWh), so your supplier has to do a calculation to turn the numbers on your gas meter (units) into kWh's.
