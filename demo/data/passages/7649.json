The energy used up is stored in the body as strain energy and it may be regained by allowing the body to relax. The best example of this is a clockwork device which stores strain energy and then gives it up.

A strain energy density function or stored energy density function is a scalar valued function that relates the strain energy density of a material to the deformation gradient. In other words, the strain energy density function can be expressed uniquely in terms of the principal stretches or in terms of the invariants of the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor or right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor and we have:"}, {"url": "http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/strain-energy", "passage_text": "noun.

As the load is applied, strains are produced and their presence increases the energy of our bar. This strain energy is the energy absorbed by the bar as a result of its deformation under load. From the principle of conservation of energy we know that this energy is equal to the work done by the load, assuming no other energy transfer (such as heat) occurred. by Marina Gandelsman.
