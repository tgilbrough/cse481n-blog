By weight, that makes the muscular system the largest of the body's systems. It is comprised of more than 650 muscles working together. Human muscles come in three types: skeletal, cardiac and smooth. Each one performs different functions within your body. Without muscles, your body wouldn't move. You wouldn't be able to breathe, walk, excrete waste or even have a beating heart without muscles. Though people usually are familiar with the functions of skeletal muscles, most of the body's muscles are not under a person's control."}, {"url": "http://www.hsdinfo.com/the-top-5-muscular-system-functions/", "passage_text": "Muscular \u00b7 Tagged: Muscular System Functions.

Skeletal muscle, as its name suggests attaches primarily to the skeleton and moves voluntarily or by reflex. Cardiac muscle is the muscle of the heart and contracts involuntarily.

The main function of the muscular system is movement. Muscles are the only tissue in the body that has the ability to contract and therefore move the other parts of the body. Related to the function of movement is the muscular system\u2019s second function: the maintenance of posture and body position. Muscles often contract to hold the body still or in a particular position rather than to cause movement."}, {"url": "http://www.innerbody.com/image/musfov.html", "passage_text": "The muscular system is responsible for the movement of the human body. Attached to the bones of the skeletal system are about 700 named muscles that make up roughly half of a person\u2019s body weight. Each of these muscles is a discrete organ constructed of skeletal muscle tissue, blood vessels, tendons, and nerves.

The functions of the muscular system are locomotion or mobility, strength, heat production, shock absorption, shaping the body, maintaining posture, and respiration. In addition it plays a role in the digestive process by peristalsis to move the food through. Skeletal muscles are attached to the bones allowing for movement. Smooth muscles line many of the bodies organs aiding in digestion. Smooth muscles line the walls of arteries, these regulate blood pressure. Lastly, cardiac muscle is what comprises the heart."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_main_function_of_the_muscular_system", "passage_text": "The muscular system has a variety of roles within the human body.

The muscular system can be broken down into three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth and cardiac, according to the NIH. Skeletal muscles are the only voluntary muscle tissue in the human body and control every action that a person consciously performs. The heart's natural pacemaker is made of cardiac muscle that signals other cardiac muscles to contract. Like visceral muscles, cardiac muscle tissue is controlled involuntarily. While hormones and signals from the brain adjust the rate of contraction, cardiac muscle stimulates itself"}]
