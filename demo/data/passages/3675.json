The internal iliac vein finds its way into the common iliac vein and the into the inferior vena cava (systemic circulation). The anastomoses connect with the superior rectal vein, which is a tributary of the inferior mesenteric vein that drains into the superior mesenteric vein and then to the portal vein. But there is a communication between the portal circulation and the rest of the systemic circulation in the so-called portocaval anastomoses, because the portal vein joins the inferior vena cava in this circulation.
