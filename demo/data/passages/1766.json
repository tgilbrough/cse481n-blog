A eukaryotic cell contains many organelles, for example, the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and chloroplast (plastid).

The term is a reference to organs, likening the way these structures operate in cells to the way organs function in the body. A number of different organelles can be found inside various types of plant, animal, and bacteria cells. Organelles are the tiny structures that perform specific functions within a cell. Mitochondria are often called the power plant of the cell. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle. Mitochondrial disorders can cause digestive problems."}, {"url": "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/organelle", "passage_text": "Definition of ORGANELLE. : a specialized cellular part (as a mitochondrion, lysosome, or ribosome) that is analogous to an organ.
