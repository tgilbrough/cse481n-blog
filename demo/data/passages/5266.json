In general, motion is classified according to the anatomical plane it occurs in. Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint are brought closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, refer to movement above or below the horizontal plane."}, {"url": "http://www.massageschoolnotes.com/joint-movements/", "passage_text": "Types of Movements of the Joints. 1  Flexion and Extension \u2013 Extension occurs when the surfaces get farther apart and the bones straighten. 2  Flexion results in a decrease of the angle at the joint and brings the bones closer together. 3  They occur in the sagittal plane around a frontal coronal axis. 1 Abduction and Adduction \u2013 frontal plane movements around a sagittal axis occur at multiaxial joints like the bal and socket joint of the shoulder or ellipsoid joints. 2  Abduction is movement away from the midline of the trunk of the body. 3  Adduction is movement medically toward the midline of the body."}, {"url": "http://www.physio-pedia.com/Cardinal_Planes_and_Axes_of_Movement", "passage_text": "An exception is extension of the thumb, which takes place in a frontal plane about a sagittal axis.

Merge this question into. Split and merge into it. Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. Lateral flexion of the trunk involves moving the shoulders left or right towards the hips, therefore it is exercised in the frontal or coronal plane of motion. Flexion is the opposite to extension where the angle between anterior surfaces is decreased (as you being then closer together by 'bending') - except for the knee where the opposite is true.     Lateral flexion is therefore a combination of there two movements."}]
