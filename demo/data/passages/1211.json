It sometimes rains every day--usually in the morning or early afternoon. The reason it rains so much here is because of the regular warm temperatures, which evaporate water and keep the humidity high. Most areas of Tropical Wet receive over 100 inches of rain per year, although some receive nearly 300 inches per year. The constant rain and direct sunlight at the equator allow tropical rainforests to develop. This is the only climate that can support true rainforests. Tropical rainforests only cover 6% of the Earth's surface, yet they produce 40% of the oxygen and support nearly half of all plant and animal species known to Earth."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_savanna_climate", "passage_text": "1 The third type of tropical savanna climate features a lengthy wet season and a relatively short dry season. 2  This version features seven or more wet season months and five or less dry season months. 3  This version's precipitation pattern is similar to precipitation patterns observed in some tropical monsoon climates.
