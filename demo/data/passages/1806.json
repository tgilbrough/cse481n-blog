"}, {"url": "http://www.alcopstore.com/index/", "passage_text": "There are several additional risks in a home wired with aluminum versus a home wired with copper. For example, aluminum wire oxidizes at a greater rate than copper. When aluminum or copper wire is exposed to oxygen, they oxidize, creating a layer of oxidation on the wire. The oxidation layer on aluminum in particular adds significantly more resistance. More resistance results in splices heating up hotter and hotter. Another danger in aluminum-wired homes can be found where the existing aluminum wire comes into contact with copper wire in applications known as \u201cpig tailing.\u201d. When electricity passes through any wire, it heats up and expands. When the power is off, the wire cools down and contracts."}, {"url": "http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/PHS/PHS.asp?id=1076&tid=34", "passage_text": "Aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust and it is widely distributed.
