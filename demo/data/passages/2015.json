Pythons live near the equator, in Asia and Africa, where it is hot and wet and their huge bodies can stay warm.

They are constrictors -- they subdue their prey by squeezing it to death. Their original distribution included Asia, Africa and Australia. However, they have been introduced into other areas accidentally, where they are becoming a threat to native species."}, {"url": "http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/python", "passage_text": "And pythons are found in the Old World (Africa, Asia, Australia) while boas live in both the Old World and the New World (North, Central, and South America).
