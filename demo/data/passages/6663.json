After you eat, it takes about six to eight hours for food to pass through your stomach and small intestine. Food then enters your large intestine (colon) for further digestion, absorption of water and, finally, elimination of undigested food. The average transit time through just the large intestine (colon) was 40 hours, with significant difference between men and women: 33 hours for men, 47 hours for women. Two British doctors studied digestion time in children"}, {"url": "http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Digestion-Chemistry/Timeline", "passage_text": "Timeline-Digestion Chemistry.

Answer 3 It'll take about 24 hours to go through your whole body. Answer 1 It depends on what you have eaten. Some foods (such as food with poor nutrition-ie junk food) digest fast while others digest slowly. On average it takes about 2 \u2026 4 hours to digest your food completely, ready to pass out the other end.

The canine digestive tract is much shorter (20-80 cm compared to 1.5 m for you) so the food stays for a much shorter time in your dog's system. Average passing time is only 24-48 hours, whereas it can take you up to three days. The faster dog digestion also contributes to his resistance to bacteria.

Total transit time, from eating to elimination in stool, averaged 53 hours (although that figure is a little overstated, because the markers used by the researchers passed more slowly through the stomach than actual food).

Food will pass through here slowly if you do not exercise sufficiently,people who exercise frequently will have faster digestion ability. The average time for food to stay in the gut transit is 24 to 56 hours. If food stays here for less than 2 hours it is a sign of very poor digestion. This will lead to dehydration, and there will be less time for nutrient absorption. In this article I will discuss a little bit about them. Food digestion takes 12-48 hours on average.
