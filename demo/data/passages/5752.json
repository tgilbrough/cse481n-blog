Sandra Pinzon. Edit. The atom is the smallest particle of an element that retains it's characteristics. Sub-atomic particles such as protons, neutrons and electrons form the atom and it is the amo \u2026 unt of each of these sub-atomic particles that make the element that element. 5 people"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "passage_text": "A chemical substance is a form of matter that has constant chemical composition and characteristic properties. It cannot be separated into components by physical separation methods, i.e., without breaking chemical bonds. Chemical substances can be chemical elements, chemical compounds, ions or alloys. Chemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from mixtures. A common example of a chemical substance is pure water; it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_smallest_piece_of_matter_a_compound_can_be_broken_into_and_still_have_the_same_properties", "passage_text": "The smallest piece of a chemical compound is a molecule.

An atom is the smallest particle of an element that has the properties of that element. Some properties of aluminum are: shiny, silver colored, fragile, and thin. Each element has its own type of properties. A molecule is the smallest particle of a substance that exists independently. Molecules of most elements are made up of only one of atom of that element. Oxygen, along with nitrogen, hydrogen, and chlorine are made up of two atoms. Look at the model of oxygen above."}]
