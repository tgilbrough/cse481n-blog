The monsoon trough, alternatively known as the intertropical convergence zone, plays a significant role in creating the climatic conditions necessary for the Earth 's tropical rainforests. The undergrowth in some areas of a rainforest can be restricted by poor penetration of sunlight to ground level. If the leaf canopy is destroyed or thinned, the ground beneath is soon colonized by a dense, tangled growth of vines, shrubs and small trees, called a jungle."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_3_biggest_threats_to_rainforests", "passage_text": "Threats to rainforest ecosystemsAs we have seen previously, rainforests are subjected to a range of natural disturbances, mainly due to cyclones and storm damage, but also drought, fire and volcanic eruptions are other natural processes that effect rainforest ecology.
