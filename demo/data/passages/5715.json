To estimate how many shingles you'll need, first estimate the total square footage of your roof's surface. To do this, measure the length and width of each plane on the roof, including dormers. Then, multiply length x width to get the square footage of each plane. Finally, calculate your roof's total square footage by simply adding the square footage of each of the planes together. For example, this shed roof has one roof plane. Simply measure length (A) x width (B): A x B = 120' x 100' = 12,000 sq. ft. for the total square footage of the roof. This gable roof has two planes."}, {"url": "http://homeguides.sfgate.com/calculate-square-footage-roof-8729.html", "passage_text": "Multiply the number of roofing squares for a low-pitch roof by 1.06 to 1.08 to get the square roof area. Multiply the number of roofing squares for a medium-pitch roof by 1.12 to 1.25 -- or by 1.3 to 1.42 for a high-pitch roof -- to get the square roof area. Convert the area to roofing squares. Because each 100 square feet of roof is one roofing square, divide the total area from Step 1 by 100.

To determine the pitch of the roof, measure over on a level line 12 inches from the edge of the roof on any part of the roof and measure vertically to see what the rise is. You also mentioned dormer windows, which leads me to think that the pitch of your roof is at least a 6/12. The length of the rafter depends on the pitch or angle of the roof and the amount of overhang at the eaves. The pitch is the rate of vertical elevation of the rafter in inches for every 12 inches of horizontal run. For a home 24 feet from front to rear, the total run to the center of the home will be 12 feet"}]
