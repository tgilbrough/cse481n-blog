The ability of these gases to trap heat is what causes the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect increases the temperature of the Earth by trapping heat in our atmosphere. This keeps the temperature of the Earth higher than it would be if direct heating by the Sun was the only source of warming."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "passage_text": "A greenhouse gas (sometimes abbreviated GHG) is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range.
