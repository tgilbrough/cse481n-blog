They are called sacromeres and are the smallest functional 'contractile unit' of a muscle cells that includes myofibilaments, such as actin and myosin. Yes, the above answer is correct:"}, {"url": "http://www.healthhype.com/muscles-muscle-fibers-myofibrils-and-myosin-actin-filaments.html", "passage_text": "Titin proteins are dense molecules that holds the actin and myosin filaments in place between each other. It is a type of springy protein that allows the entire contractile unit to function. These lines are the reason why skeletal muscle has a striated appearance."}, {"url": "http://www.humanneurophysiology.com/motorunit.htm", "passage_text": "Motor unit consists of a motor neuron and the group of skeletal muscle fibers which it innervates. Three types of motor units are found in skeletal muscle. The largest of these are the type A motor units, which are characterized by high contractile speed and power."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_contractile_units_of_skeletal_muscles", "passage_text": "The smallest unit of skeletal muscle is the muscle fiber or  myofiber. These fibers contain a lot of the nuclei, sarcomeres and  mitochondria."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_contractile_unit_of_muscle", "passage_text": "What is the contractile unit of muscle? already exists. already exists as an alternate of this question. exists and is an alternate of.

Actin is a thin filament and myosin is a thick filament, as shown on the following diagram, and it is the interaction between these two filaments that causes a muscle to contract and shorten."}, {"url": "http://faculty.etsu.edu/forsman/Histologyofmuscleforweb.htm", "passage_text": "The sarcomere is the functional or contractile unit of muscle. To recap, a whole muscle if made up of many smaller bundles known as fascicles. Each fascicle is made up of many muscle cells (myofibers). Myofibers contain cylindrical bundles of myofibrils which in turn contain many smaller bundles of myofilaments."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_contractile_unit_of_muscle", "passage_text": "They are called sacromeres and are the smallest functional 'contractile unit' of a muscle cells that includes myofibilaments, such as actin and myosin.
