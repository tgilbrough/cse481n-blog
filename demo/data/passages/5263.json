Side effects associated with prednisone include sleep problems, dry skin, dizziness, nausea, and changes in the shape of body fat.

This asthma treatment works by reducing inflammation in the airways that cause the bronchi to constrict and make breathing difficult.

Of those people with asthma, those who have a severe, chronic form that is resistant to treatment are most likely to also have GERD. GERD is the backward flow of stomach acids into the esophagus. When this acid enters the lower part of the esophagus, it can produce a burning sensation, commonly referred to as heartburn. If you have both asthma and GERD, it is important that you consistently take any asthma medications your doctor has prescribed to you, as well as controlling your exposure to asthma triggers as much as possible."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/heartburn-asthma", "passage_text": "GERD can irritate asthma and damage the esophagus. It is believed that asthma attacks can also cause the sphincter to relax, making it easier for acid reflux to occur. Another potential link to asthma for patients with GERD is that when acid enters the esophagus, a nerve reflex is triggered, causing the airways to narrow in order to prevent the acid from entering. Some asthma medications can increase heartburn and other symptoms of GERD."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/heartburn-asthma", "passage_text": "People with asthma are twice as likely to have GERD as people who do not have asthma, especially those with treatment-resistant asthma.
