Osteopathy is based on the principle that the wellbeing of an individual depends on their bones, muscles, ligaments and connective tissue functioning smoothly together. In the UK, osteopathy is a complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) , and is different from conventional western medicine.

The cranial concept, first put forth by W. G. Sutherland, DO and originally alluded to by A.T. Still, MD, involves the application of Dr. Still's principles of Osteopathy to the head (cranium) and to the tailbone (sacrum). It is based on The Five Components of the Primary Respiratory Mechanism. The cranial osteopath is not preferential to the cranium or the sacrum. Instead he or she includes these areas in an overall evaluation and treatment plan, considering the whole body as one dynamic, integrated unit of function. Today, scientists and many MDs, with the benefit of high tech diagnostic equipment, not only concur that cranial motion exists but that it is central to the function of the body. There are many forms of treatment and therapy that claim to do the same thing as cranial osteopathy, but none can approach it."}, {"url": "http://www.quackwatch.com/04ConsumerEducation/QA/osteo.html", "passage_text": "These numbers strongly suggest that the percentage of osteopathic physicians doing chelation therapy is about four or five times as high as the percentage of medical doctors doing it. Curiously, Ronald A. Esper, DO, of Erie, Pennsylvania, who was AOA's president in 1998, is an ACAM member and does chelation therapy. There are 20 accredited colleges of osteopathic medicine and about 44,000 osteopathic practitioners in the United States [3]. Admission to osteopathic school requires three years of preprofessional college work, but almost all of those enrolled have a baccalaureate or higher degree."}]
