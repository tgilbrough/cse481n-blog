Neurons carry impulses from one place to another, around the many parts of the nervous system. They connect receptors to the central nervous system and also connect one part of the nervous system to another, for example in the brain and spinal cord. They also carry impulses from the nervous system to effector organs, such as muscles and glands. When neurons are stimulated they transmit an electrical impulse.
