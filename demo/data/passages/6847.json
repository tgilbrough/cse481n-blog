The Pardoner preaches against sin and avarice by quoting that greed is the root of all evil. In his introduction to the others in the Canterbury Tales, he claims he has relics that he shows when he is preaching. These relics, he admits, are fake, and that he is gripped by the very greed he preaches against. Sin and avarice are the main points of the Pardoner s tale. The tale is often used by preachers to illustrate the vices that can lead to death. One can assume that the Pardoner, having covered his own profession, has practiced this tale several times."}, {"url": "http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/canterbury/section11.rhtml", "passage_text": "Summary: Introduction to the Pardoner\u2019s Tale.

Probably the greatest on is The Pardoner's Tale. A greedy Pardoner who preaches to feed his own desires tells The Pardoner's Tale. This story contains excellent examples of verbal, situational, and dramatic irony. Verbal irony occurs when a writer or speaker says one thing but really means something quite different. Situational irony occurs when what actually happens is the opposite of what is expected or appropriate. An instance where situational irony occurs is in the prologue where the Pardoner states that he preaches that the root of all evil is avarice."}, {"url": "http://chaucer.lmc.gatech.edu/the-pardoners-tale-and-the-canterbury-tales-as-a-death-warrant/", "passage_text": "The Pardoner\u2019s Tale and the Canterbury Tales as a Death Warrant.
