Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms such as animals (some annelid worms [Which ones?] , turbellarians and sea stars), fungi, and plants."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/asexual-reproduction-in-plants-advantages-disadvantages-types.html", "passage_text": "Asexual reproduction requires only one parent. Since there is only one parent, there is no exchanging of genetic information, and the offspring are clones of the parent.

Asexual reproduction is a mode of reproduction by which offspring arise from a single organism, and inherit the genes of that parent only; it does not involve the fusion of gametes and almost never changes the number of chromosomes. Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual.

Asexual reproduction is advantageous in allowing beneficial combinations of characteristics to continue unchanged and in eliminating the often vulnerable stages of early embryonic growth.

In many ways, asexual reproduction is a better evolutionary strategy: Only one parent is required, and all of that parent's genes are passed on to its progeny. In sexual reproduction, only half of each parent's genes are passed to the next generation.

Best Answer: Sexual reproduction allows traits that are adaptive/beneficial to spread through a population and species fairly quickly. It also allows 2 or more beneficial traits that have evolved independently in 2 or more individuals to be passed along to the same descendants. Sexual reproduction also promotes genetic diversity, so that a population is less susceptible in case of disease epidemics. For example, when the plague hit Europe, some individuals by chance had mutations that allowed them to survive, and they did."}, {"url": "http://www.enotes.com/homework-help/explain-why-sexual-reprouction-ia-an-adventage-44361", "passage_text": "Posted on.

The environment is constantly changing and there need the change of the characteristics to sustain in the changing environment. 2.

If a parent has a disease like Huntington's disease and that person reproduces with someone who doesn't have the disease there is a chance that when they reproduce the child will not have the disease. Why Sexual Reproduction is Better than Asexual Reproduction. I feel like a good place to start is with an investigation to understand why sexual reproduction is better than asexual r"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction", "passage_text": "Current hypotheses suggest that asexual reproduction may have short term benefits when rapid population growth is important or in stable environments, while sexual reproduction offers a net advantage by allowing more rapid generation of genetic diversity, allowing adaptation to changing environments. Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms such as animals (some annelid worms [Which ones?] , turbellarians and sea stars), fungi, and plants."}]
