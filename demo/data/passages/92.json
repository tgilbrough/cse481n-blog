Dynamic occur with movement or through the use of free weights. When an athlete lifts a free weight they are exerting a force against gravity. This contraction is often called an isotonic contraction. This is inaccurate however, as the muscle tension changes in relation to the angle of flexion and since the angle of flexion changes throughout the movement the tension cannot be equal throughout. There are two types of dynamic contractions: 1) Concentric Contractions, 2) Eccentr"}, {"url": "http://muscle.ucsd.edu/musIntro/contractions.shtml", "passage_text": "Contractions that permit the muscle to shorten are referred to as concentric contractions. An example of a concentric contraction in the raising of a weight during a bicep curl. In concentric contractions, the force generated by the muscle is always less than the muscle's maximum (P o). As the load the muscle is required to lift decreases, contraction velocity increases. This occurs until the muscle finally reaches its maximum contraction velocity, V max. By performing a series of constant velocity shortening contractions, a force-velocity relationship can be determined"}, {"url": "http://muscle.ucsd.edu/musIntro/contractions.shtml", "passage_text": "A third type of muscle contraction, isometric contraction, is one in which the muscle is activated, but instead of being allowed to lengthen or shorten, it is held at a constant length. An example of an isometric contraction would be carrying an object in front of you. In concentric contractions, the force generated by the muscle is always less than the muscle's maximum (P o).

When we think of a muscle contracting normally, we tend to think of the muscle shortening as it generates force. While it's true that this is a way of muscle contracting, there are many different ways that a muscle can generate force, as seen in Figure 1 below. In concentric contractions, the force generated by the muscle is always less than the muscle's maximum (P o). As the load the muscle is required to lift decreases, contraction velocity increases."}]
