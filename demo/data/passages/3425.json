Oxygen is extracted from the air we breathe by the lungs. It passes into the blood vessels that surround the lungs and is carried to all the cells of the body by the blood. Most of the oxygen is carried by the red blood cells, though some of it is carried by the water in the blood. A deficiency of water means reduced oxygen delivery by the blood. When the blood is cleansed, it has oxygen. When it is dirty, it has more waste or carbon dioxide. The condition of the blood will determine the function and the condition of the organs.
