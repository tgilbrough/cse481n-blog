[{"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Does_enterobacter_cloacae_ferment_lactose", "passage_text": "90% to 100% of Enterobacter aerogenes strains can ferment glucose, sucrose, and lactose. The same percentage of strains produce gas as a byproduct of that fermentation. Non-lactose fermenting bacteria utilize peptone instead of lactose.  This can be seen in agar where the formation of ammonia leads to  white colonies on the plate. Some bact \u2026 eria in this group include  Salmonella, Yersinia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella."}, {"url": "http://iws2.collin.edu/dcain/CCCCD%20Micro/macconkeyagar.htm", "passage_text": "Organisms which ferment lactose produce acid end-products which react with the pH indicator neutral red, and produce a pink color. Quadrant 1: Growth on the plate indicates the organism, Enterobacter aerogenes, is not inhibited by bile salts and crystal violet and is a gram-negative bacterium. The pink color of the bacterial growth indicates E. aerogenes is able to ferment lactose. Back to Tutorial.

Enterobacter aerogenes is a Gram negative rod-shaped bacterium in the same family as Esherichia coli. It can grow on many of the same selective media as Esherichia coli, including: MacConkey Agar, EMB agar and Lauryl-Tryptose broth. 3) E. coli is positive in the methyl red test while E. aerogenes is usually, but not always, negative (this is not the best test to rely on). 4) E.coli is positive for the indole test while E. aerogenes is negative, this is a very reliable test. 5) E. aerogenes can grow on Simmon's citrate agar while E. coli does not."}, {"url": "http://iws2.collin.edu/dcain/CCCCD%20Micro/macconkeyagar.htm", "passage_text": "Quadrant 4: Growth on the plate indicates the organism, Salmonella typhimurium, is not inhibited by bile salts and crystal violet and is a gram-negative bacterium.
