The kidneys are found deep inside the upper part of the belly (abdomen). The adrenal gland has 2 parts. The outer part, called the cortex, is where adrenal cortical tumors start. The cortex makes certain hormones for the body. These hormones are called steroids. The inner part of the adrenal gland, called the medulla, is really part of the nervous system. Nervous system hormones are made in the medulla. Tumors of the adrenal medulla are not covered here."}, {"url": "http://www.surgery.usc.edu/divisions/tumor/PancreasDiseases/web%20pages/Endocrine%20tumors/adrenal/adrenal%20tumors.html", "passage_text": "The adrenal cortex also produces a hormone called aldosterone that is involved in regulating the amount of salt and water in your body. The inner part of the adrenal gland is called the adrenal medulla. The adrenal medulla produces hormones called catecholamines such as adrenaline and noradrenaline. Catecholamines play a role in the response to acute or sudden severe stress, for example during life threatening event.

There is one above each kidney, and the kidneys are deep inside the upper part of the abdomen. It is the most common cancerous tumour of the adrenal gland. Tumours can also start in the medulla of the adrenal gland. When chromaffin cells in the medulla become abnormal, they can lead to a tumour called pheochromocytoma.
