Injuries to any of these structures can lead to an unstable knee joint. In order to increase stability, you will need to strengthen the muscles surrounding the joint including muscles of the hips and thighs. Squats stabilize the knee joint by strengthening the supportive thigh and hip muscles.

The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints. The joints of the shoulder are the shoulder joint (or glenohumeral joint), and the acromioclavicular joint.
