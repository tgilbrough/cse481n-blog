The Mekong River Basin is home to more species of massive fish than any river on Earth. It is also the most productive fishery in the world, generating $1.7 billion each year in revenue from the thousands of fish farms along it's banks. In addition to Thailand's native fish species, there have been many introduced species especially from the Amazon region. Although most introduced species still reside purely in commercial waters, in 2009 a 100kg Arapaima was captured form a tributary of the Mekong River."}, {"url": "http://mekong.riverawarenesskit.org/html/1.12a.0_fish_fisheries.html", "passage_text": "SUMMARY.

If the farmer can raise shrimp there: the water of the river is not dirty. Mekong River flow rate is about 50000 cubic meter/second, a lot of water, my friends."}]
