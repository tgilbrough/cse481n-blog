The main function of the esophagus is to propel swallowed food or fluid into the stomach. This occurs through sequential or peristaltic contraction of circular muscle in the esophageal body, in concert with appropriately timed relaxation of the upper and lower esophageal sphincters."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_push_food_down_into_the_stomach", "passage_text": "Your esophagus moves it so even when you eat upside down it will still go to your stomach.

The primary peristaltic wave forces the bolus down the esophagus and into the stomach in a wave lasting about 8-9 seconds. In much of the gastrointestinal tract, smooth muscles contract in sequence to produce a peristaltic wave which forces a ball of food (called a bolus while in the esophagus and gastrointestinal tract and chyme in the stomach) along the gastrointestinal tract."}, {"url": "http://www.innerbody.com/image_dige01/dige03-new2.html", "passage_text": "The esophagus is about 9-10 inches (25 centimeters) long and less than an inch (2 centimeters) in diameter when relaxed.

Pre-digestion in the Stomach After swallowing the food, it moves down the esophagus, which is 18 to 24 inches long. The esophagus moves through the warm core of the body and is responsible for warming the food to close to body temperature, which is ideally 98.6. In fact, the stomach will enlarge beyond the size of the meal until it is fully inflated. While the stomach is inflating to its full size which takes somewhere between 40 to 60 minutes, pre-digestion takes place.
