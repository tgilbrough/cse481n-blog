Similarly, Systemic enzymes, also called metabolic enzymes works inside the blood, tissues, and cell of the body system. Some of the important Systemic enzymes include Fibrinolytic enzymes, Proteases, and Catalases. Among them, Serrapeptase and Nattokinase are the essential Fibrinolytic enzymes, which act to break down excess fibrin in the body. These enzymes fight inflammation, fibrosis (scar tissues), and viruses; modulate the immune system; and cleanse the blood."}, {"url": "http://www.astenzymes.com/exclzyme", "passage_text": "Systemic enzyme therapy refers to the therapeutic use of natural enzymes to produce desired healing effects.
