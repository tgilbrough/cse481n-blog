[{"url": "http://www.thequantumpulse.com/how_it_works.htm", "passage_text": "The QuantumPulse uses a multi-wave oscillator and spectrum tubes containing noble and other gases to create frequencies that fall between the infrared and ultraviolet spectrum range. It also uses a coil to create high voltage and a subtle electromagnetic field. This combination produces biophotonic light. The new patented tuning capacitor sits atop the machine and produces alpha waves. The QuantumPulse produces a 90\u00b0 phase shift between electrical and electromagnetic fields. The base of the machine is constructed of materials which block electrical fields, but allow electromagnetic fields to flow."}, {"url": "http://fitnessential.co/the-quantum-pulse/", "passage_text": "An electromedicine device which has had very, very good results treating Multiple Sclerosis is called the \u201cQuantum Pulse.\u201d Older versions of the device were called the \u201cVibe Machine.\u201d The two machines are identical in function so it doesn\u2019t matter which device you use.

If you do an honest comparison, you will see the Biocharger is a MUCH better machine for $8000 LESS. Plus the Biocharger has a wider spectrum of frequencies and offers a new pulsing function found on no other machine.

The new Quantum Pulse is the new name of the VIBE machine and it is basically the same machine with a new name. There are definite problems with the Quantum Pulse because of its incomplete circuitry. It is a detuned unit with no adjustable spark gap and has only two settings. Because of this you won\u2019t reach voltages of over 200,000 volts so it will not effectively inactivate pathogens, viruses, bacteria, and parasites.
