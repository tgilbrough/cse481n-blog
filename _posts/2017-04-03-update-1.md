 - Language Detection
     - **Description:** Wikipedia provides millions of articles in many different languages which could be used to train a language detection system.
     - **MVP:** High accuracy on entire Wikipedia articles. This could be done with a very simple model. A harder goal would be to achieve comparable accuracy to Google Translate on shorter snippets of text.
     - **Stretch Goal:** Find articles about the same topic in different languages using only the text of the article.
