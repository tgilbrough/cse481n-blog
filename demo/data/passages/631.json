The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase. Young fronds-raw or cooked. Used before they fully unroll, they are thick and succulent. Sometimes sold in speciality markets according to one report, whilst another says that they are a famine food that is only used when all else fails. Rootstock-peeled and roasted. Low open ground, alluvial thickets and rich woods. Spores-surface sow as soon as they are ripe in mid-winter and keep the soil moist. It is best to keep the pot in a sealed plastic bag to hold in the moisture.

Description. One of the largest fern species, the ostrich fern can easily reach a height of 5 feet or more. Large fiddleheads emerge in spring as the fern emerges from dormancy. These will develop in to large, slightly scaly, sterile fronds that will persist through early fall. Matteuccia struthiopteris, with its exotic, palm-like appearance, is a wonderful addition to any moist woodland area or shade garden. It tolerates most soil types, but it will do best in slightly acidic, moist to wet soil that is rich in organic matter."}, {"url": "http://classygroundcovers.com/product/79196/Matteuccia-struthiopteris-br-10-Bare-Root-plants", "passage_text": "Ostrich Fern {10 Bare Root plants }.
