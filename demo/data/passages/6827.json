An organ system comprised of skeletal muscles, smooth muscles, and cardiac muscles that are responsible for providing strength, keeping up balance, maintaining posture, allowing movement and producing heat. Supplement. The animal body is comprised of various organ systems and the muscular system is one of them. The muscular system includes all the muscle tissues such as the skeletal muscle tissues, smooth muscle tissues, and cardiac muscle tissues. The skeletal muscles are muscles attached to the bones and are responsible for the voluntary movements of the body."}, {"url": "http://www.yourdictionary.com/muscular-system", "passage_text": "The bodily system that is composed of skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle tissue and functions in movement of the body or of materials through the body, maintenance of posture, and heat production. 1  Link/Cite.
