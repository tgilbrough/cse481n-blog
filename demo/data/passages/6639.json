The average adult gerbil weighs about 2.5 oz. gerbil is a small mammal of the order Rodentia. Once known simply as  desert rats , the gerbil subfamily includes about 110 species of African, Indian, and Asian rodents, including sand rats and jirds, all of which are adapted to arid habitats."}, {"url": "http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/gerbils/tips/gerbils_as_pets.html", "passage_text": "You'll also spend a few hundred dollars per year on bedding and food, both of which average about a bag per month depending on the number of gerbils. Wood pulp bedding like Carefresh costs about $20 per bag and a high quality gerbil chow such as Gerri Gerbil runs about $5 per bag. gerbil's lifespan is about 3 to 4 years.

For each additional gerbil, the tank should be 5 gallons larger. Fill up a third of the tank with a substrate like Megazorb, Finacard, Carefresh or Bedexcel that the gerbils can dig in.

They mate again as soon as the babies are born, so a second litter will come even if you remove the dad when the first litter arrives. The initial gestation is about 24 days. A nursing female gerbil will have a delayed gestation and usually be pregnant with the second litter for about five weeks. Male gerbils make great fathers and raising the babies is most successful when the dad is in with the mother gerbil to help out. You can get a male gerbil neutered. Just make sure you find a small animal veterinarian who has done this procedure with high frequency and success in the past.
