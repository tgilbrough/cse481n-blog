The formation of a dipeptide from two amino acids is accompanied by the loss of a water molecule (Figure 3.18)."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_is_a_peptide_bond_formed", "passage_text": "A peptide bond is a covalent chemical bond formed between two molecules when the carboxyl group of one molecule reacts with the amino group of the other molecule, thereby releasing a molecule of water (H2O).
