The purpose of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) is to provide a low cost, accessible, efficient tribunal with a focus on dispute resolution. VCAT deals with a variety of matters but does not assist with debt recovery, motor vehicle accident claims or fencing disputes. A member of VCAT presiding over your matter will then deliver a decision either on the spot at the hearing, or for more complex matters shortly after in writing. All appeals of a VCAT decision can be made in the Supreme Court of Victoria but only on questions of law."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_concatenation", "passage_text": "Virtual concatenation (VCAT) is an inverse multiplexing technique creating a large capacity payload container distributed over multiple smaller capacity TDM signals. These signals may be transported or routed independently. Virtual concatenation has been defined for SONET / SDH, OTN and PDH path signals. VCAT helps in providing services at a lower cost and more quickly than contiguous concatenation. However, it creates differential delay whereby each path that is created, represented by a VT has a different propagational delay across the network. The difference in these delays is called differential delay (D)."}, {"url": "http://www.vcat.tv/", "passage_text": "VCAT office hours: Wednesdays \u2013 Fridays 11:00 am \u2013 5:00 pm.

The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) was formed by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998 in the state of Victoria, Australia. As part of the Victorian Justice system the Tribunal sits 'below' the Magistrates Court in the court hierarchy. However the Tribunal itself is not a Court as it is a creature of statute and has no inherent jurisdiction or powers. The Tribunal began operating on 1 July 1998, amalgamating 15 smaller boards and tribunals, creating a 'one-stop-shop' for handling a broad range of disputes. When looking at the sheer number of cases, the VCAT deals with the overwhelming majority of legal proceedings in this State [1] .
