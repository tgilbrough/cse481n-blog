I have afriend that put about 100 000km on his car last year, he he's on his 4 set of pads, and second sets of rotors, and just put new calipers on. I've seen gm brakes completely gone on cars with 12,000 mi. I usually replace front pads @ 80,000, and rear shoes - 120,000 mi. But it's a Honda, and it's a stick shift. On my work truck, I have 40,000, and no signs of wear to pads. But it's a Toyota 4Runner, unfortunately they don't make them with stick, and I had no choice other than get it automatic.

A vigorous driver may only get 15,000 miles. There are many types of brake pads; OEM, sport, heavy duty, and racing. The harder you drive, the faster the brake pads will wear out.

Front brake pads generally can go about 30,000 miles before they need to be changed. Because front brake pads take more of the weight when a car stops, the rear brake pads may last twice as long, or about 60,000 miles. On average, front brake pads should be replaced around 30,000 miles and rear brake pads around 60,000, but other factors such as type of car and driving habits affect brake pad life. References."}]
