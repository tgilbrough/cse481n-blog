[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc", "passage_text": "Zinc, in commerce also spelter, is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2. Many alloys contain zinc, including brass, an alloy of copper and zinc. Other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium, antimony, bismuth, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, tin, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, tellurium and sodium."}, {"url": "http://geology.com/usgs/uses-of-zinc/", "passage_text": "A third significant use of zinc is in the production of zinc oxide (the most important zinc chemical by production volume), which is used in rubber manufacturing and as a protective skin ointment.

Zinc is also a natural insect repellent and sun screen, helping to protect our skin. After iron, aluminium, and copper, zinc is the fourth most common metal we use today. Around 70% of the world's zinc comes from mining, the remaining 30% comes from recycling the metal because zinc is 100% recyclable."}, {"url": "http://www.denturecreamlawsuitattorney.com/articles/common-uses-of-zinc/", "passage_text": "Common Uses of Zinc. The metallic chemical element Zinc is one of the most widely-used metals across the world. Zinc is found in many everyday items, and it is also an essential mineral for the human body.

Most zinc is used to galvanise other metals, such as iron, to prevent rusting. Galvanised steel is used for car bodies, street lamp posts, safety barriers and suspension bridges. Large quantities of zinc are used to produce die-castings, which are important in the automobile, electrical and hardware industries. But the most visible example of zinc at work doesn't give any indication of this greyish metal-instead it's in an alloy that mixes the sheen of gold with the common touch. When molten zinc and copper are mixed together, the result is bold as brass."}]
