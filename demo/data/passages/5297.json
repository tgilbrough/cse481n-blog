Aerodynamics is the study of forces and the resulting motion of objects through the air. Studying the motion of air around an object allows us to measure the forces of lift, which allows an aircraft to overcome gravity, and drag, which is the resistance an aircraft \u201cfeels\u201d as it moves through the air. Everything moving through the air (including airplanes, rockets, and birds) is affected by aerodynamics."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics", "passage_text": "In many aerodynamics problems, the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight: lift, drag, thrust, and weight. Of these, lift and drag are aerodynamic forces, i.e. forces due to air flow over a solid body. The term aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, with the difference being that gas dynamics applies to the study of the motion of all gases, not limited to air."}, {"url": "http://howthingsfly.si.edu/forces-flight/four-forces", "passage_text": "Four Forces Affect Things That Fly: 1  Weight is the force of gravity. 2  Lift is the force that acts at a right angle to the direction of motion through the air. 3  Thrust is the force that propels a flying machine in the direction of motion. 4  Drag is the force that acts opposite to the direction of motion. 1 Lift is created by differences in air pressure. 2  Thrust is the force that propels a flying machine in the direction of motion. 3  Engines produce thrust"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamic_force", "passage_text": "When an airfoil (or a wing) is moving relative to the air it generates an aerodynamic force, in a rearward direction at an angle with the direction of relative motion.
