Although all pottery is kiln-fired, that does NOT mean that it can saf \u2026 ely cope with the (much lower) temperatures in a domestic oven. (The reason that non-ovenproof ware cracks in an oven is: (i) expansion takes place too fast; and (ii) there may be a residual water content that expands into steam. First turn off the oven.  If the fire is because of grease spewing, then cover it up with a pan to smother it.  If it won't go out then fires should be doused with baking s \u2026 oda or a fire extinguisher-but not water on grease or electrical fires. 3 people found this useful."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery", "passage_text": "Pottery is the ceramic material which makes up pottery wares, of which major types include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. Creation of ceramic pottery takes place in workshops that are also called called potteries. Pottery also refers to the art or craft of a potter or the manufacture of pottery. A dictionary definition is simply objects of fired clays. 1 Glaze fired is the final stage of some pottery making. 2  A glaze may be applied to the bisque form and the object can be decorated in several ways. 3  After this the object is glazed fired, which causes the glaze material to melt, then adhere to the object."}, {"url": "http://www.hotkilns.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Spec-Ceramic-Process_0.pdf", "passage_text": "Apply the kiln wash to the thickness of a postcard.

Once the ceramic has been shaped, it is fired in a high temperature oven known as a kiln. Often, ceramics are covered in decorative, waterproof, paint-like substances known as glazes. Ceramics are classified as inorganic and nonmetallic materials that are essential to our daily lifestyle. Ceramic and materials engineers are the people who design the processes in which these products can be made, create new types of ceramic products, and find different uses for ceramic products in everyday life."}, {"url": "http://www.hotkilns.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Spec-Ceramic-Process_0.pdf", "passage_text": "Heat shock, which is usually catastrophic, is something that can happen in the kiln or may occur gradually over time.In truth, simply test-firing the kiln and the ware to be fired is usually enough to deal with the complexity of the process.
