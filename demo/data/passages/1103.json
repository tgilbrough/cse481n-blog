Well the chlorophyll helps the plant go through photosynthesis by absorbing the the light into the plant and transferring it into food. The definition for chlorophyll is the pigment in green plants that absorbs solar energy. Now chlorophyll a is important because chlorophyll is the molecule found in all plant cells and therefore its concentration is what is reported during chlorophyll analysis. During this process of photosynthesis, chlorophyll produces energy, in the form of sugary carbohydrates, which will power all of the plant's essential growth and development. This amazing molecule also gives plants their distinctive green color."}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_aqa_pre_2011/plants/plants1.shtml", "passage_text": "Green plants absorb light energy using chlorophyll in their leaves. They use it to react carbon dioxide with water to make a sugar called glucose. The glucose is used in respiration, or converted into starch and stored. Oxygen is produced as a by-product.

Its name is derived from the Greek words \u03c7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, chloros (green) and \u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, phyllon (leaf). The function of the vast majority of chlorophyll (up to several hundred molecules per photosystem) is to absorb light and transfer that light energy by resonance energy transfer to a specific chlorophyll pair in the reaction center of the photosystems."}, {"url": "http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/chlorophyll/chlorophyll_h.htm", "passage_text": "Chlorophyll is the molecule that absorbs sunlight and uses its energy to synthesise carbohydrates from CO 2 and water.

Chlorophyll is the molecule that traps this 'most elusive of all powers' - and is called a photoreceptor. It is found in the chloroplasts of green plants, and is what makes green plants, green.
