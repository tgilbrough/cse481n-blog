The Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms, for the purpose of maintaining a militia. Nonetheless, most of the important rights contained in the Bill of Rights have been incorporated under this theory. Only a few have been held not to apply, such as the right to bear arms, the right to a grand jury indictment, and the right to a jury trial in civil cases."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "passage_text": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
