Emphysema is one of several diseases known collectively as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Smoking is the leading cause of emphysema. Your lungs' alveoli are clustered like bunches of grapes. In emphysema, the inner walls of the air sacs weaken and eventually rupture \u2014 creating one larger air space instead of many small ones. This reduces the surface area of the lungs and, in turn, the amount of oxygen that reaches your bloodstream."}, {"url": "http://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/emphysema-symptoms", "passage_text": "In this article. Emphysema is a form of chronic (long-term) lung disease, usually caused by smoking. Because of lung damage, people with emphysema have difficulty blowing air out. The major symptom of emphysema is shortness of breath. In most people, symptoms of emphysema are slowly progressive. Shortness of breath is by far the most common of emphysema symptoms.
