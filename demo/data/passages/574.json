It remained the antimalarial drug of choice until the 1940s, when other drugs, such as chloroquine, that have fewer unpleasant side effects replaced it. Quinine is also used to treat lupus and arthritis. In the past, quinine was frequently prescribed in the US as an off-label treatment for nocturnal leg cramps, but this has become less prevalent due to a Food and Drug Administration statement warning against the practice."}, {"url": "http://www.peoplespharmacy.com/2010/10/11/is-quinine-in-tonic-water-safe/", "passage_text": "Tonic contains 83 mg. of quinine in a liter. An eight-ounce glass or tonic would only have about 20 mg of quinine, considerably less than the dose that used to be prescribed for leg cramps (200 to 300 mg). The trouble is that some people are extremely sensitive to quinine\u2019s toxic effects. This drug can cause headache, rash, ringing in the ears, nausea, dizziness and blurred vision. The most serious reactions are rare but can be life threatening."}, {"url": "http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/quinine", "passage_text": "Quinine is only approved for the treatment of malaria.

Quinine is used to treat malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Plasmodium falciparum is a parasite that gets into the red blood cells in the body and causes malaria.
