Arthritis is a general term for conditions that affect the joints and surrounding tissues. Joints are places in the body where bones come together, such as the knees, wrists, fingers, toes, and hips. The two most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 1  Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful, degenerative joint disease that often involves the hips, knees, neck, lower back, or small joints of the hands.

Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in joint deformity. While both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis can affect the small joints of the hand, there are differences. Rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect the middle joints of the fingers and the joints where the fingers attach to the hand. Osteoarthritis more commonly affects the joints at the ends of the fingers and at the base of the thumb. In rheumatoid arthritis, the same joints usually are affected on both sides of the body. This symmetry doesn't typically occur in osteoarthritis, so it's common for only one hand or knee to be painful."}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/rheumatoid-arthritis/ra-vs-oa", "passage_text": "The fluid buildup causes pain, stiffness, tenderness and inflammation\u2014symptoms of RA.
