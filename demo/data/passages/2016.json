The part of the country you live in and the pet shop itself also makes a difference in the cost. I use to keep and breed geckos. I also new many breeders on the herpetological society and a few pet shop owners. Here in Ohio, I have payed anywhere from $15.00 to $70.00 for different gecko species. A local pet shop where I live sells adult Leopard geckos for $45.00 to $50.00. Babies are always cheaper. The aquarium and everything you need for it will cost more than the gecko. Make sure you have the money and time to care for whatever breed of gecko you choose"}]
