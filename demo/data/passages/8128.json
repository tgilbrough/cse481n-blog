The craftsman knows what he wants to make before he makes it.\u2026The making of a work of art\u2026is a strange and risky business in which the maker never knows quite what he is making until he makes it. \u2013 R.G.

Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is vague, but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created."}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_art", "passage_text": "Aboriginal art is art made by indigenous Australian people. It includes work made in many different ways including painting on leaves, wood carving, rock carving, sculpting, ceremonial clothing and sand painting. Aboriginal art is closely linked to religious ceremonies or rituals.

It is the energy mind that provides the ideas, visions, inspirations for true works of art; and a true artist is a person who makes an object that is reality aligned - meaning that it exists both in the Hard, as well as having an energetic reality to it."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Art_Made_the_World", "passage_text": "To find the answer, we need to go way back in time. \u2014\u202fNigel Spivey's opening narration. How Art Made The World is a 2005 five-part BBC One documentary series, with each episode looking at the influence of art on the current day situation of our society.
