Also, we need to know how long the sun shines each day on average. Let this be denoted by Tsun, Therefore, the upfront cost of the solar panels per watt are Costpanels = $600/75 watts = $8/watt Or, by multiplying numerator and denominator by 1000, Costpanels = $600/75 watts = $8000/kilo-watt. As determined from a survey of current market prices, it costs about $600 to purchase and install a 75 watt panel."}, {"url": "http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/solar.html", "passage_text": "An $18,000 system ($12,600 after the tax credit) that produces 3800 kWh a year in a windy place with 12mph avg. windspeed will produce 76,000 kWh over its 20-year life, for a cost of $0.17 per kWh. That's much more than grid energy, and way more than solar. If you use 900 kWh/mo., that's 900 kWh / 30.4 days per month = 29.6 kWh/day. Figure how many kWh you need to generate each hour. From the map above you can see that if you live in a yellow area that you'll get 5 to 6 hours of peak sun per day on average."}, {"url": "http://www.gogreenacademy.com/solar-energy-cost-calculator/", "passage_text": "Instructions: 1  Enter your monthly energy consumption in kWh. 2  Enter your utility electricity rate in dollars per kilowatt-hour. 3  Select the installation cost of the solar system per watt. 4  Enter your state/ local utility rebate in $ per watt. 1 Select the installation cost of the solar system per watt. 2  Typical residential solar systems cost around $7 per watt. 3  Commercial systems cost less"}, {"url": "http://sroeco.com/solar/calculate-solar-cost/how-calculate-solar-cost/", "passage_text": "Step 2: Estimate your cost per Watt installed.
