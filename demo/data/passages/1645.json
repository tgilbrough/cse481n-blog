Polarity is a term used in electricity, magnetism, and electronic signaling. Suppose there is a constant voltage, also called an electric potential or electromotive force (EMF), between two objects or points. In such a situation, one of the objects or points (poles) has more electrons than the other.

Also a voltage has a polarity, in that it could be positive \u2026 or negative, with respect to some other voltage, such as the one at the other end of a battery or electric circuit. When someone mentions water polarity, they are talking about the intermolecular properties of water. Water is a polar-covalent bonded molecule which means that even though the \u2026 hydrogens are sharing electrons with the oxygens, the electrons will be attracted slightly more to the element with the bigger nucleus. 5 people found this useful"}, {"url": "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/polarity", "passage_text": "Full Definition of POLARITY. 1. : the quality or condition inherent in a body that exhibits opposite properties or powers in opposite parts or directions or that exhibits contrasted properties or powers in contrasted parts or directions: the condition of having poles. 2.

Polarity in covalent bonds arises from differences in electronegativity between the participating elements. For example, the covalent bond in a molecule of water, H2O, is polar. Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so the end of the molecule containing the oxygen atom has a partial negative charge."}]
