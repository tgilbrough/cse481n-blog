Examples 1  : One very well-insulated 1,000-square-foot home in Boston needs around 24,000 BTUs to heat in winter. Please note that this calculator can only gauge a rough estimate.

This post will help you determine how many watts you need to effectively heat your room. The process is also outlined in our product selection guide. In general we recommend that you use between 6 and 10 watts per square foot you are trying to heat. 1 Insulation/type of windows \u2013 better insulation and energy-efficient windows will retain more heat.

Older homes with less insulation will use about 10 watts to heat each square foot. Newer homes with greater insulation values will only use about 6 watts per square feet. It will take approximately 600 watts to heat a 100 square foot room in a newer home. Older homes will need as much as 1,000 watts for the same room. 3. Calculate how large the baseboard heater will be. Baseboard heaters use about 250 watts of power for every foot of length.
