Share. Boiling Point Definition: The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the external pressure surrounding the liquid. Therefore, the boiling point of a liquid depends on atmospheric pressure. The boiling point becomes lower as the external pressure is reduced."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_point", "passage_text": "Boiling water.
