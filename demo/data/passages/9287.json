[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery", "passage_text": "Arteries form part of the circulatory system. They carry blood that is oxygenated after it has been pumped from the heart. Arteries also aid the heart in pumping blood. Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the tissues, except for pulmonary arteries, which carry blood to the lungs for oxygenation. (Usually veins carry deoxygenated blood to the heart but the pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood.) There are two unique arteries. Systemic arteries are the arteries (including the peripheral arteries), of the systemic circulation, which is the part of the cardiovascular system that carries oxygenated blood away from the heart, to the body arterioles, and then to the capillaries, where nutrients and gases are exchanged."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery", "passage_text": "Arteries (from Greek \u1f00\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 (art\u0113ria) , meaning windpipe, artery) are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.

Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body, and veins carry oxygen-poor blood back from the body to the heart. Your body also contains other, smaller blood vessels.
