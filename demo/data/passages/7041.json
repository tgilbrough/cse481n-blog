Originally, it was submitted as the tenth planet in the solar system. Ultimately, however, Eris' discovery was a big reason astronomers demoted Pluto to dwarf planet status in 2006. But Eris is even farther-flung than Pluto, circling our star from about three times farther away. It takes 561 years for the distant dwarf planet to make a single trip around the sun, though it rotates once every 25 hours, making the length of its day very similar to a day on Earth."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_(dwarf_planet)", "passage_text": "Eris is a trans-Neptunian dwarf planet (plutoid). Its orbital characteristics more specifically categorize it as a scattered-disk object (SDO), or a TNO that has been scattered from the Kuiper belt into more-distant and unusual orbits following gravitational interactions with Neptune as the Solar System was forming.
