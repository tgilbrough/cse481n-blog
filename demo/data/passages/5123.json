Sulfur foods and supplements are those containing a thiol group. Some sulfur foods are not obviously sulfury (like coffee and chocolate). NAC is an example of a thiol supplement. The negative effects of sulfur on high cysteine people may occur over a 4-7 day period after the last sulfur ingestion.

While the majority of amino acid sulfur is needed for making protein, it also serves as a cofactor for certain enzymes, which are substances that help bring about chemical reactions. Protein-rich foods, such as fish, poultry, meats, nuts and legumes, are not only essential for building and maintaining healthy skin, hair and nails, but also are good dietary sources of sulfur."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/289250-list-of-foods-high-in-sulfur/", "passage_text": "Eggs.

Sulphur is present in most meats, but I recommend healthier sources of sulphur. Sulphur-rich vegetables contain extremely potent organosulfur compounds that offer special health benefits.

One of sulfur's most important roles is as part of protein molecules. As such, most of the sulfur in your body and your diet is in protein molecules. Protein foods that contain the sulfur amino acids methionine, cystine and cysteine are particularly good dietary sources. Eggs are among the highest dietary sources of sulfur, with meat, poultry and fish also providing large amounts. For vegans and vegetarians, soy products and other legumes are good sources of the sulfur-containing amino acids. Nuts, seeds and grains are also good vegetarian sources of methionine."}, {"url": "http://www.just-health.net/Foods-High-In-Sulfur.html", "passage_text": "Most of the food groups contain at least a few foods that are high in sulfur. The people most likely to be deficient in this mineral are vegans since the list of fruits and vegetables containing sulfur is relatively short and these categories of foods contain relatively low amounts of sulfur. Other vegetables that are high in sulfur are sweet corn, peas, spinach, broccoli, mustard greens, cauliflower, bamboo shoots, cabbage, kale, kohlrabi, asparagus, okra, lettuce, and eggplant.

Sulfur is a mineral found in the ground around volcanic craters and hot springs and occurs naturally in some plants, including grains, fruits and vegetables. Protein foods also contain sulfur, which may put vegetarians at risk for developing a sulfur deficiency. The mineral helps form muscles, hair and skin cells. Legumes, such as beans and jicama also contain protein and sulfur. Nuts such as walnuts, almonds, cashews, as well as certain seeds, such as sesame seeds and sunflower seeds, contain sulfur."}]
