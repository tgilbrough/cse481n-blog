The polymers form by the breaking of the double bonds, allowing the carbons involved in the double bonds to bond to one more atom, resulting in the long chained polymers. Now what makes these polymers different is the fact that polystyrene has a benzene ring attached to one of the carbons. To my knowledge while this is not a different functional group, the chemical properties of the two should remain the same, however the physical properties will change."}, {"url": "http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/ahp/SDPS/SD.PS.polymers.html", "passage_text": "Monomers and Polymers. Monomers are small molecules, mostly organic, that can join with other similar molecules to form very large molecules, or polymers. All monomers have the capacity to form chemical bonds to at least two other monomer molecules. monomers. Polymers are a class of synthetic substances composed of multiples of simpler units called monomers. Polymers are chains with an unspecified number of monomeric units. a polymer.
