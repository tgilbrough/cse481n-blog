It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats by promoting the absorption of glucose from the blood to skeletal muscles and fat tissue and by causing fat to be stored rather than used for energy."}, {"url": "http://www.madehow.com/Volume-7/Insulin.html", "passage_text": "Background. Insulin is a hormone that regulates the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood and is required for the body to function normally. Insulin is produced by cells in the pancreas, called the islets of Langerhans."}, {"url": "http://www.madehow.com/Volume-7/Insulin.html", "passage_text": "Raised blood glucose triggers the cells in the islets of Langerhans to release the necessary amount of insulin. Insulin allows the blood glucose to be transported from the blood into the cells. Cells have an outer wall, called a membrane, that controls what enters and exits the cell."}, {"url": "https://www.dnalc.org/view/15928-How-insulin-is-made-using-bacteria.html", "passage_text": "How insulin is made using yeast. Synthetic human insulin was the first golden molecule of the biotech industry and the direct result of recombinant DNA technology. Currently, millions of diabetics worldwide use synthetic insulin to regulate their blood sugar levels."}, {"url": "http://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/En/ResourceCentres/Diabetes/AboutDiabetes/Pages/Insulin-An-Overview.aspx", "passage_text": "Insulin is a hormone, which is a type of chemical. In the body, insulin is produced in the pancreas. It is needed to allow sugars, or glucose, from food to enter cells. There, glucose is broken down (metabolized) to produce the energy needed for the cells to work properly."}, {"url": "http://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/type-1-diabetes/what-insulin", "passage_text": "Continue ReadingPatient Guide to Insulin: About Diabetes. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows your body to use sugar (glucose) from carbohydrates in the food that you eat for energy or to store glucose for future use. Insulin helps keeps your blood sugar level from getting too high (hyperglycemia) or too low (hypoglycemia)."}, {"url": "http://www.wisegeekhealth.com/what-is-insulin.htm", "passage_text": "Insulin is a hormone that is produced by the pancreas and that regulates the level of glucose \u2014 a simple sugar that provides energy \u2014 in the blood. Human bodies require a steady amount of glucose throughout the day, and that glucose comes from the foods that people eat."}]
