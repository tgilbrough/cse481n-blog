For example, If Buddy\u2019s a 22 pound puppy, he weighs 10 kg \u2013 divide his weight in pounds by 2.2 for his metric measurement \u2013 the final total is about 800 calories: (70 x 10kg) x .75 x 2 = 800."}, {"url": "http://princetonvet.net/calories-for-pets/", "passage_text": "So 686 calories for the dog, divided by 370 calories per cup of dog food, means that this dog will need around 1.8 cups of this food per day. If you feed your dog twice a day, she would need a little less than one cup at each feeding. Figure out how many cups your pets need in a day, and divide that amount to the number of times you feed them every day. Okay.

To calculate your dog\u2019s daily caloric needs, we use the formula: Daily calories = Body Weight (kg) X 30 + 70, or 329 calories per day.

In this case, your dog would need to drink 329 mL per day.

Most dogs need about 25 to 30 calories per pound per day to maintain their weight. You need to figure in, if you dog is a spud or an athlete, whether you need to add or subtract that to that amount. That means, on average, a 30 lb dog needs around 800 calories daily, and an average cat needs 250 to 300 calories a day. Really not much. The calories in the treats really add up."}]
