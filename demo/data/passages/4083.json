Here, the fluctuations are expressed in terms of equilibrium thermodynamic parameters and the derivatives of thermodynamic potentials. It is possible to find not only the fluctuations of quantities xi but also the correlations between fluctuations, which define the interrelation of the fluctuations; it may be noted that only in the case of statistically independent quantities."}, {"url": "http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fluctuation", "passage_text": "A little fluctuation of the wind now carried the path of the forest fire to the north, then blew back and the flames nearly stood still as though held in leash by some master hand.
