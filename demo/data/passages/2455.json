Others may have slightly more phosphorus to encourage blooming, such as a 5-10-5 fertilizer. Organic Fertilizers. Organic fertilizers are made from plant material. Many consider them superior to inorganic fertilizers to condition the soil and improve the health of plants. Common organic fertilizers include: 1  Compost: Compost is made from decomposed plants. 2  Grass clippings, leaves raked from the lawn, apple peels, and any discard uncooked fruit or vegetable peels or cores can be added to a compost pile. 3  Some people add shredded newspaper, tea bags and coffee grounds"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "passage_text": "Potash is a mixture of potassium minerals used to make potassium (chemical symbol: K) fertilizers. Potash is soluble in water, so the main effort in producing this nutrient from the ore involves some purification steps; e.g., to remove sodium chloride (NaCl), i.e. common salt. All nitrogen fertilizers are made from ammonia (NH 3), which is sometimes injected into the ground directly. The ammonia is produced by the Haber-Bosch process. In this energy-intensive process, natural gas (CH 4) supplies the hydrogen and the nitrogen (N 2) is derived from the air."}, {"url": "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fertilizer", "passage_text": "fertilizer. noun fer\u00b7til\u00b7iz\u00b7er \\-\u02ccl\u012b-z\u0259r\\.

If you purchase a 50 pound bag, 5 pounds (or 10 percent) would be nitrogen, 5 pounds would be phosphorous and 5 pounds are potassium. Or you can use granular organic fertilizers. They\u2019re made up of grains such as ground corn, alfalfa, cottonseed or soy as well as blood and feather meal. The primary advantage of organic fertilizers is their slow release of nitrogen and other fertilizer elements. That means a lower chance of leeching or burning."}, {"url": "http://whyzz.com/what-is-fertilizer", "passage_text": "Inorganic fertilizer is usually made from chemical processes that put some of a plant\u2019s favorite nutrients like potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus into the fertilizer product.

To make plants grow faster, what you need to do is supply the elements that the plants need in readily available forms. That is the goal of fertilizer. Most fertilizers supply just nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium because the other chemicals are needed in much lower quantities and are generally available in most soils. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium availability is the big limit to growth. 1 Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (a.k.a. potash) - The three macronutrients and the three elements you find in most packaged fertilizers. 2  Sulfur, calcium, and magnesium-Secondary nutrients. 3  Boron, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum and zinc-Micronutrients."}]
