A current Uber radio commercial features a guy saying he makes about $500 dollars a month driving for Uber, but he could make $5000 a month if he so desired. The message being, it\u2019s up to you, prospective Uber driver.

There is also no such thing as an Uber driver salary. As described above, drivers are paid a portion of the fare for every ride that is given.

Getty Images. Uber has made some lofty claims about just how much its drivers can make a year. The company has said its UberX drivers can make $90,000 a year in New York and up to $60,000 in Dallas. But in other places, UberX is the company's low-cost ridesharing service. We put Uber's salary claims to the test by talking to a half dozen UberX drivers in New York City and Dallas. The max that I've made on an hourly basis is about $45 to $55 an hour, one Dallas UberX driver told us."}, {"url": "http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2014/06/09/how-much-do-uberx-drivers-actually-make-per-hour/", "passage_text": "So, what does that mean for Boston uberX drivers? Part-time drivers, like the subject of an earlier BostInno report, who make $300 on an exceptional weekend night (about $200 net, after Uber's 20 percent cut and gas money is deducted), can make approximately $21,000 per year. While current and prospective Boston uberX drivers have been told they can potentially make upwards of $50,000 shuttling Uber users around for more than 40 hours per week, the tech company appears to be cooking the books."}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-uber-drivers-really-make-2014-11", "passage_text": "Uber says its drivers can make $90,000 a year driving for UberX in New York City. Last month, Business Insider talked to Uber drivers who said they weren't making nearly that much. Because drivers incur a myriad of different costs and all driver patterns and behaviors vary wildly, it is nearly impossible to estimate with certainty exactly what the average driver makes (because there really is no such thing as an average Uber driver)."}, {"url": "http://www.idrivewithuber.com/how-much-do-uber-drivers-make/", "passage_text": "This is very close to the $19 an hour the average Uber driver makes around the country.

Uber last year infamously claimed many of its drivers made more than $90,000 per year, but it did not account for the cost of driver expenses like gas and car maintenance. I drive for Uber in the San Francisco Bay Area. My story is I don't really make that much as an Uber driver.
