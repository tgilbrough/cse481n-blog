Terrestrial television is a type of television broadcasting in which the television signal is transmitted by radio waves to the TV receiver from a terrestrial (Earth based) transmitter, a television station, and received with an antenna. The rise of digital terrestrial television, especially high-definition television (HDTV), may mark an end to the decline of broadcast television reception by traditional receiving antennas, which can receive over-the-air HDTV signals."}]
