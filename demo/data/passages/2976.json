The Oster TSSTTVMNDG toaster oven has a 90 min ute timer that turns off the oven automatically when it gets to zero. You can change the cooking time, up to 90 minutes, for BAKE, BROIL, CONVECTION BAKE, WARM, DEFROST, and PIZZA. I am surprised that Oster allows 90 minutes for the BROIL setting. Many other toaster ovens have a much shorter maximum cooking time for the BROIL setting because it gets very hot inside.

Regular ovens have uneven spots because they depend solely on the heating elements. This radiant heat is uneven, plus the distance of the food from the elements makes a difference to the temperature. The convection toaster oven is ready to go in a jiffy because it heats up quickly. It is faster cooking as well, because it uses a fan to force the hot air around the oven. This airflow blows away a thin layer of air that normally sits around the food, insulating it from the oven heat."}, {"url": "http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/cleaning/tips/a12452/heloise-spring-cleaning-toaster-oven/", "passage_text": "First, unplug the appliance. Remove the crumb tray at the base of the toaster, and shake out the accumulated food particles.

Although self-cleaning ovens make it possible to clean without chemicals, the self-cleaning process may involve some risk. Self-cleaning ovens work by heating to a very high temperature, usually between 800 and 900 degrees Fahrenheit, and incinerating oven build-up over a number of hours.
