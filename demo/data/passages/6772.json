The conditions in this group have a range of signs and symptoms that involve fragile blood vessels. COL4A1 -related brain small-vessel disease is characterized by weakening of the blood vessels in the brain. Stroke is often the first symptom of this condition, typically occurring in mid-adulthood. The COL4A1 gene mutations that cause COL4A1 -related brain small-vessel disease result in the production of a protein that disrupts the structure of type IV collagen. As a result, type IV collagen molecules cannot attach to each other to form the protein networks in basement membranes."}, {"url": "http://www.ehow.com/about_4740835_small-vessel-ischemic-disease.html", "passage_text": "The area of the brain that is affected by small vessel ischemic disease is where the brain cells and the neurons are connected. The tiny vessels that bring blood flow to that area are called small vessels, while large vessels bring blood flow to large organs including the heart, kidneys and lungs. Small vessel ischemic disease is actually a byproduct of other diseases and the impact that those diseases have on the brain's white matter. Unlike a disease of the brain itself, it is what happens to the brain during the progression of certain chronic conditions including diabetes and high blood pressure."}, {"url": "http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Vasculopathies", "passage_text": "When it is found in small blood vessels in the skin, characteristic rashes may be seen.
