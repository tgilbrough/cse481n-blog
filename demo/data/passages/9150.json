The sediment particles are clasts, or pieces, of minerals and fragments of rock, thus sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock. It is composed mostly of sand, which means particles of a medium size, so sandstone is a medium-grained clastic sedimentary rock. More precisely, sand is between 1/16 millimeter and 2 mm in size (silt is finer and gravel is coarser)."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/How_is_sandstone_created_or_formed", "passage_text": "The weight from the deposits above cause compaction of the lower deposits.

The grains of sand in a sandstone are usually particles of mineral, rock or organic material that have been reduced to sand size by weathering and transported to their depositional site by the action of moving water, wind or ice. To a geologist the word sand in sandstone refers to the particle size of the grains in the rock rather than the material of which it is composed. Sand-size particles range in size from 1/16 millimeter to 2 millimeters in diameter."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-sandstone-formation-properties-types.html", "passage_text": "One of the most common types of sedimentary rock is sandstone. As the name implies, sandstone contains sand-sized grains of rock fragments and individual minerals broken down from other, older rocks. We all have a sense of how big sand grains typically are from our experience going to the beach or playing in a sand box. "}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandstone", "passage_text": "Sandstone (sometimes known as arenite) is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized minerals or rock grains. Most sandstone is composed of quartz and/or feldspar because these are the most common minerals in the Earth's crust. Like sand, sandstone may be any color, but the most common colors are: tan, brown, yellow, red, grey, pink, white, and black. Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features, certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions."}, {"url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081124104409AAcRCd5", "passage_text": "Best Answer: he formation of sandstone involves two principal stages. First, a layer or layers of sand accumulates as the result of sedimentation, either from water (as in a river, lake, or sea) or from air (as in a desert)."}, {"url": "http://flexiblelearning.auckland.ac.nz/rocks_minerals/rocks/sandstone.html", "passage_text": "Sandstone is a sedimentary rock formed from cemented sand-sized clasts. The cement that binds the clasts can vary from clay minerals to calcite, silica or iron oxides.
