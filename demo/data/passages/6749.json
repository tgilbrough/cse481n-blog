Synapses are essential for homeostasis as they can either transmit or inhibit impulses. As well as occurring between neurons, synapses also occur at junctions between neurons and effectors (i.e. either muscles or glands); like the junction between a neuron and skeletal muscle cells shown below. Synaptic junctions are of two types; CHEMICAL and ELECTRICAL. 1) CHEMICAL. If the excitable cells are neurons (as above), or a neuron and a muscle cell (shown right), the junction between them forms a chemical synapse"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse", "passage_text": "The word synapse \u2013 from the Greek synapsis (\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), meaning conjunction, in turn from \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u1f76\u03bd (\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd (together) and \u1f05\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (to fasten)) \u2013 was introduced in 1897 by English physiologist Michael Foster at the suggestion of English classical scholar Arthur Woollgar Verrall.
