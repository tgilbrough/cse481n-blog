COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) was one of the earliest high-level programming languages. It was developed in 1959 by a group of computer professionals called the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL). Since 1959 it has undergone several modifications and improvements. The language continues to evolve today. Object-oriented COBOL is a subset of COBOL 97, which is the fourth edition in the continuing evolution of ANSI/ISO standard COBOL. COBOL 97 includes conventional improvements as well as object-oriented features."}, {"url": "http://www.pgrocer.net/Cis12/cobollan.html", "passage_text": "1 A COBOL program is written in an English type language that cannot be understood by the machine, therefore it has to be translated using a compiler. 2  A compiler translates the code all at once and produces a machine version of the program. 1 This translation is done with a compiler that reads the high level COBOL language of the SOURCE PROGRAM and converts each high level COBOL instruction into one or more machine language instructions. 2  The OBJECT PROGRAM is the result."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL", "passage_text": "COBOL is an industry language and is not the property of any company or group of companies, or of any organization or group of organizations.
