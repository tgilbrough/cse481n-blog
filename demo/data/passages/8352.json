The introduction of exogenous DNA into a cell is called transformation (transfection in animal cells). Transformation is a naturally occurring process in bacteria. Bacteria need to be in a certain physiological state to successfully take up exogenous DNA, which is described as one of competence. Some bacteria are naturally competent, but usually only for a brief time at a certain stage of their growth cycle."}, {"url": "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exogenous", "passage_text": "Definition of EXOGENOUS. 1. 2. b: introduced from or produced outside the organism or system; specifically: not synthesized within the organism or system. \u2014 ex\u00b7og\u00b7e\u00b7nous\u00b7ly adverb.
