Capocollo [kapo\u02c8k\u0254llo] also known as [gaba'goul] (in the United States, cappicola, coppa in Canada, capicollo or capicolla), is a traditional Italian pork cold cut (salume) made from the dry-cured muscle running from the neck to the 4th or 5th rib of the pork shoulder or neck. The name capocollo comes from capo (head) and collo (neck) of a pig. It is a whole muscle salume, dry cured and, typically, sliced very thin. It is similar to the more widely known cured ham or prosciutto, because they are both pork-derived cold-cuts that are used in similar dishes."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act", "passage_text": "COPPA redirects here.
