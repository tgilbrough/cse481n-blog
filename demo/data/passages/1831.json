Titanium alloys are less dense and stronger compare to other metals. Therefore they mainly used in ship, aircraft, and spacecraft. Generally pure metals are less useful sue to more softness. Alloys show quite different properties compare to their constituent metals. They show quite batter properties than metals. For example; steel is an alloy of iron and used as building material due to high strength. Similarly brass and bronze can easily mold in various shapes compare to"}, {"url": "http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/alloy", "passage_text": "Alloys of iron and carbon include cast iron and steels; brass and bronze are important alloys of copper; amalgams are alloys that contain mercury; and chromium is an important additive in stainless steel. Because pure gold and silver are soft, they are often alloyed with one another or with other metals. For alternating-current applications, silicon-ferrite is commonly used. This is an alloy of iron containing as much as 5% silicon.

Similarly, the silver used in jewelry and the aluminium used as a structural building material are also alloys. The term alloy is sometimes used in everyday speech as a synonym for a particular alloy. For example, automobile wheels made of an aluminium alloy are commonly referred to as simply  alloy wheels , although in point of fact steels and most other metals in practical use are also alloys. The term alloy is used to describe a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal. The primary metal is called the base, the matrix, or the solvent.

Along with enhancing gold\u2019s strength, alloying gold with other metals changes some of gold\u2019s other properties as well. They are Gold, Silver, and Platinum.
