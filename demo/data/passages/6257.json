[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acyl_chloride", "passage_text": "In organic chemistry, an acyl chloride (or acid chloride) is an organic compound with the functional group-COCl. Their formula is usually written RCOCl, where R is a side chain. They are reactive derivatives of carboxylic acids. A specific example of an acyl chloride is acetyl chloride, CH 3 COCl. Where the acyl chloride moiety takes priority, acyl chlorides are named by taking the name of the parent carboxylic acid, and substituting-yl chloride for-ic acid."}, {"url": "http://www.chemguide.co.uk/mechanisms/addelim/whatis.html", "passage_text": "Acyl chlorides (also known as acid chlorides) are one of a number of types of compounds known as acid derivatives. This is ethanoic acid: If you remove the-OH group and replace it by a-Cl, you have produced an acyl chloride. This molecule is known as ethanoyl chloride and for the rest of this topic will be taken as typical of acyl chlorides in general. Acyl chlorides are extremely reactive."}, {"url": "http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/350/Carey5th/Ch20/ch20-1-3.html", "passage_text": "Carboxylic acid derivatives react tend to react via nucleophilic acyl substitution where the group on the acyl unit, R-C=O undergoes substitution: Study Tip: Note that unlike aldehydes and ketones, this reactivity of carboxylic acids retains the carbonyl group, C=O. . The observed reactivity order is shown below: This reactivity order is important. You should be able to understand, rationalise and use it.

In this type of reaction, a nucleophile \u2013 such as an alcohol, amine, or enolate \u2013 displaces the leaving group of an acyl derivative \u2013 such as an acid halide, anhydride, or ester. Under basic conditions, a nucleophile (Nuc) attacks the carbonyl group of the acyl compound 1 to give tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate 2.
