The ceiling's angle is another necessary factor regarding fan size. The angle is measured in degrees and reflects the difference between the ceiling and adjoining walls. Using a roof angle finder and a leveler can help you calculate the ceiling's angle. A ceiling fan with a 12-inch downrod is suitable for a vaulted ceiling that has a 14- to 18.4-degree ceiling angle.

Ceiling fan size can be determined by measuring the height and width of your room. If you are installing a fan in a patio, bathroom, den, or small bedroom, it is important to measure the height of the ceiling. If you have a low hanging ceiling you may want to purchase a flush mount ceiling fan. The blade span of vaulted ceiling fans can vary. If your vaulted ceiling is low and your slope is small, you should determine the fan size based on the room size. If you have a higher ceiling and need a longer downrod, it\u2019s best to purchase a fan with a larger blade span that can fully circulate the air."}, {"url": "http://www.lowes.com/projects/build-and-remodel/install-a-ceiling-fan/project", "passage_text": "The ceiling fan you install should be the right size for the room: 1  Rooms that measure about 75 square feet need a fan with a 29- to 36-inch blade diameter. 2  For rooms measuring 76 to 144 square feet, choose a fan with a blade diameter of 36 to 42 inches.
