Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called drones and one or more fertile females called  queens . The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators.

They are however only a minority in the genus, which includes over 200 species of Solenopsis worldwide. Solenopsis are stinging ants and most of their common names reflect this, for example, ginger ants and tropical fire ants. Many species also are called red ants because of their light brown colour, though species of ants in many other genera are similarly named for similar reasons. Fire ants often attack small animals and can kill them. Unlike many other ants, which bite and then spray acid on the wound, fire ants bite only to get a grip and then sting (from the abdomen) and inject a toxic alkaloid venom called Solenopsin, a compound from the class of piperidines."}, {"url": "http://www.eaglepestservices.com/what-is-a-group-of-ants-called.html", "passage_text": "A group of ants is called a colony, or sometimes an army.
