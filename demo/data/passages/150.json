The process of digestion involves the breakdown of a complex molecule into the simplest form the body can use. Once the starch molecule is broken down, the small intestine transfers it into the bloodstream, where it is shuttled to the cells that need it. Starch digestion is a multi-step process that begins in the mouth. The goal of digestion is the breakdown of nutrients into their simplest, usable form by the body"}]
