[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype", "passage_text": "A phenotype (from Greek phainein, meaning to show, and typos, meaning type) is the composite of an organism 's observable characteristics or traits, such as its morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, phenology, behavior, and products of behavior (such as a bird's nest). Here the relation between genotype and phenotype is illustrated, using a Punnett square, for the character of petal colour in pea. The letters B and b represent genes for colour and the pictures show the resultant flowers."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_are_Genotype_and_Phenotype", "passage_text": "Genotype refers to the genetic traits in an organism. It has to do with the genetic coding of an organism. Such coding is inheritable. The genotype is the genetic load that is copied every time a cell divides, and therefore is inherited down to the next generation. Phenotype refers to observable, physical manifestations of an organism. The phenotype includes physical characteristics, behaviors corresponding to such species, structures, organs, behaviors, relfexes, etc. The genotype is the genetic programming that provides the phenotype."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype", "passage_text": "A phenotype results from the expression of an organism's genes as well as the influence of environmental factors and the interactions between the two. When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species, the species is called polymorph. Here the relation between genotype and phenotype is illustrated, using a Punnett square, for the character of petal colour in pea.

The letters B and b represent genes for colour and the pictures show the resultant flowers. In the case of an albino with a recessive allele (aa), the phenotype depends upon the other allele (Aa, aa or AA). An affected person mating with a heterozygous individual (Aa or aA, also carrier) there is a 50-50 chance the offspring will be albino's phenotype."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype-phenotype_distinction", "passage_text": "Genotype-phenotype distinction. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The genotype\u2013phenotype distinction is drawn in genetics.  Genotype  is an organism's full hereditary information.  Phenotype  is an organism's actual observed properties, such as morphology, development, or behavior. This distinction is fundamental in the study of inheritance of traits and their evolution. An organism's genotype is a major (the largest by far for morphology) influencing factor in the development of its phenotype, but it is not the only one. Even two organisms with identical genotypes normally differ in their phenotypes. One experiences this in everyday life with monozygous (i.e. identical) twins."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_are_Genotype_and_Phenotype", "passage_text": "It's a genotype. The phenotype is a physical manifestation of the genotype, which means that it's what happens on the outside because an organism has the gene. An example of a \u2026 phenotype would be if someone had blue eyes or something. The genotype is the two-letter abbreviation thingy.

This genetic constitution of an individual influences \u2013 but is not solely responsible for \u2013 many of its traits. The phenotype is the visible or expressed trait, such as hair color. Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of a cell. For each individual trait (such as hair or eye color), a cell contains instructions on two alleles, which are alternative forms of the gene obtained from the mother and the father."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype", "passage_text": "The Genotype is that part (DNA sequence) of the genetic makeup of a cell, and therefore of an organism or individual, which determines a specific characteristic (phenotype) of that cell/organism/individual. In the case of an albino with a recessive allele (aa), the phenotype depends upon the other allele (Aa, aa or AA). An affected person mating with a heterozygous individual (Aa or aA, also carrier) there is a 50-50 chance the offspring will be albino's phenotype."}]
