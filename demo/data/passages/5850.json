Here are some steps to follow to guide you through your next project. Step 1 - Clean the Area. The most important thing to do before you begin the painting process is to clean off the aluminum soffit. If you begin with a dirty surface, the paint won't look as great or last as long.

If you attempt to paint your aluminum soffit the same way you would a surface made of wood, heavy flaking will ultimately ensue. Aluminum soffits are nonporous. This makes them poorly suited for paint. Treat the soffit with a special acidic base coat, formulated for metallic surfaces. Once the soffits are primed, they will take a painted finish.
