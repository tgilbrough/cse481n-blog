My favorite Puerto Rican dish is Arroz con Habichuelas, or rice and beans. The beans are actually a stew, with potatoes, squash, other veggies, some ham and, of course, beans. I eat this, served over rice, for a meal whenever I can find it. You may have to poke around in the ethnic aisle of your supermarket for some of the ingredients. This recipe will feed about 12 people as a side dish or 6 people as a main dish. Vegetarians can make this without the ham (and using vegetable stock instead of ham stock) and it still tastes great."}, {"url": "http://www.dominicancooking.com/979-habichuelas-con-dulce-sweet-creamed-beans.html", "passage_text": "1 Change the water and boil until soft in abundant water. 2  Put the beans (and the water in which they boiled) in a blender a puree. 3  Strain the beans to get rid of the skins and undissolved solids. 4  Pour the beans, coconut milk and half the milk into a pot and bring to a boil over medium heat. 1 Add the rest of the milk, sugar, raisins, cinnamon, cloves and sweet potatoes and boil for 10 minutes. 2  Stir regularly to avoid sticking. 3  Boil until it has reduced to about \u00be of the original volume-the cream of beans will get much thicker when chilled)."}, {"url": "http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/nutrition-habichuelas-con-dulce-2519.html", "passage_text": "Ingredients and Serving Suggestions.
