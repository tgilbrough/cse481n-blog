Lice can only live for about 36 hours after being dislodged from your head. You shouldn't need any pesticides for your furniture or carpet.

The life span of an adult louse on a host ranges up to 30 days. During this time, the female head louse can deposit about 90 eggs. After incubating for seven to 10 days, the nits hatch and, after another 10 days, mature into adult head lice and the cycle begins again. Off the host, adult head lice can live about two to four days at 74 degrees Fahrenheit (F) and one to two days at 86 degrees. Nits will remain alive off the host for up to 10 days; they will not hatch at or below room temperature (68 degrees F)"}, {"url": "http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/human_lice.htm", "passage_text": "Head lice and pubic lice are highly dependent upon human body warmth and will die if separated from their host for 24 hours.
