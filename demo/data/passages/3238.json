Muda has been given much greater attention as waste than the other two which means that whilst many Lean practitioners have learned to see muda they fail to see in the same prominence the variation of mura (unevenness) and muri (overburden)."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing", "passage_text": "Essentially, lean is centered on making obvious what adds value by reducing everything else. Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy derived mostly from the Toyota Production System (TPS) (hence the term Toyotism is also prevalent) and identified as lean only in the 1990s. Lean principles are derived from the Japanese manufacturing industry. The term was first coined by John Krafcik in his 1988 article, Triumph of the Lean Production System, based on his master's thesis at the MIT Sloan School of Management."}, {"url": "http://blog.lantech.com/blog/bid/308506/eliminate-the-muda-the-7-types-of-waste-in-lean-manufacturing", "passage_text": "We do that by eliminating the muda. Muda is a Japanese term that means waste.. Since lean manufacturing was originally a Japanese management philosophy, we often borrow Japanese terms and concepts. The foundational philosophy behind lean manufacturing is to eliminate waste. It's not to work faster or better, it's to eliminate waste of any kind that's not adding value."}, {"url": "http://www.emsstrategies.com/dm090203article2.html", "passage_text": "The seven wastes originated in Japan, where waste is known as \u201cmuda.. The seven wastes is a tool to further categorize \u201cmuda\u201d and was originally developed by Toyota\u2019s Chief Engineer Taiichi Ohno as the core of the Toyota Production System, also known as Lean Manufacturing. To eliminate waste, it is important to understand exactly what waste is and where it exists.

Lean is about the relentless and continuous removal of waste from the processes within an organisation and was an academic description of the Toyota Production System.

One popular and well-known concept of the Toyota Production System is the elimination of waste, in Japanese also called muda (\u7121\u99c4). It is through the popularity of the Toyota Production System, and by proxy, lean manufacturing, that it is mostly associated with Toyota. Nevertheless, it is one of the important concepts of the Toyota Production System, along with unevenness (mura) and overburden (muri)."}]
