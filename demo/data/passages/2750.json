The main portion of the cell is called the soma or cell body. It contains the nucleus, which in turn contains the genetic material in the form of chromosomes. Neurons have a large number of extensions called dendrites. They often look likes branches or spikes extending out from the cell body. A clump of neuron cell bodies, for example, is called a ganglion (plural: ganglia) or a nucleus (plural: nuclei). A fiber made up of many axons is called a nerve. In the brain and spinal cord, areas that are mostly axons are called white matter, and it is possible to differentiate pathways or tracts of these axons."}, {"url": "http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/N/Neurons.html", "passage_text": "Link to CNS.

Thus the nucleus accumbens is often described as one part of a cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop. Location: The nucleus accumbens core is part of the ventral striatum, located within the basal ganglia.
