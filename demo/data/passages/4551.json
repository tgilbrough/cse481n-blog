Definition. noun. The carbon at which anomers rotate. Supplement. An example of anomeric carbon is that carbon in a monosaccharide (like glucose) about which rotation occurs. The anomeric carbon can be determined by the carbon (C) attached to two oxygen (O) atoms joined by single bonds. This rotation brings about two distinct configurations, \u03b1 and \u03b2 -anomers."}, {"url": "http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=14231", "passage_text": "Definitions: 1. the reducing carbon of a sugar; C-1 of an aldose, C-2 of a 2-ketose.
