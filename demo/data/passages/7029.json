If the thermostat is calling for heat, the boiler will fire until the high limit is reached, then shut off (even if the thermostat is still calling for heat). The boiler will re-fire if the boiler water temperature drops below a range around the high limit.

The way in which the boiler aquastat operates is the same way in which device that controls pressure for a boiler that is powered by steam. It also works in a similar manner as the limit control device for a forced air furnace system. The boiler aquastat has a heat sensing element that is filled. This element allows the device to switch on and off automatically and is designed to notice when the water temperature in the boiler rises and falls. If function of the aquastat is to control the boiler temperature, is closes whenever the internal temperature falls and correspondingly opens when the temperature inside the boiler increases.

An aquastat is similar to the furnace limit switch in operation, maintaining a safe operating temperature for the central heating unit. Despite the name, most boilers are not actually meant to boil water. Doing so would result in steam, and a dangerous buildup of pressure in a system that is not designed for it. For this reason, the aquastat shuts off the boiler when it reaches the high temperature limit."}]
