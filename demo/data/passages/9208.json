[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis", "passage_text": "In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product. Most plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis maintains atmospheric oxygen levels and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for life on Earth. Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation. Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction, so photosynthesis needs to supply both a source of energy to drive this process, and the electrons needed to convert carbon dioxide into a carbohydrate."}, {"url": "http://study.com/academy/lesson/photosynthesis-i-photolysis-and-the-light-reactions.html", "passage_text": "Before we begin on how the light reactions work, let's remind ourselves of the products and reactants for photosynthesis. In this process, remember that light energy, carbon dioxide, and water are used to produce glucose, or sugar, and oxygen. In this lesson, we'll learn how two of these reactants are used. These reactions use photolysis, or the use of light energy to split water molecules and produce oxygen. In these light-dependent reactions, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and other pigments and transferred to the reaction center of photosystem II."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-dependent_reactions", "passage_text": "The light-dependent reactions begin in photosystem II. When a chlorophyll a molecule within the reaction center of PSII absorbs a photon, an electron in this molecule attains a higher energy level. The thylakoid membrane contains some integral membrane protein complexes that catalyze the light reactions. There are four major protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane: Photosystem II (PSII), Cytochrome b6f complex, Photosystem I (PSI), and ATP synthase."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-dependent_reactions", "passage_text": "In photosynthesis, the light-dependent reactions take place on the thylakoid membranes. The inside of the thylakoid membrane is called the lumen, and outside the thylakoid membrane is the stroma, where the light-independent reactions take place.

Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, convert NADP into NADPH which is then used in the light-independent reactions. Oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis and ATP is synthesized from ADP and inorganic phosphate. This all happens in the grana of chloroplasts. During this reaction, sugars are built up using carbon dioxide and the products of the light-dependent reactions (ATP and NADPH) and various other chemicals found in the plant in the Calvin Cycle."}, {"url": "http://wps.aw.com/bc_campbell_concepts_7_oa/215/55164/14122052.cw/content/index.html", "passage_text": "Oxygen is released when carbon dioxide is broken down to extract carbon for later use in building glucose. Oxygen is released when water is broken down to extract electrons and protons for use in the light reactions. Oxygen is produced from breakdown of an intermediate product in the Calvin cycle. Oxygen is produced as a waste product in the form of cellular respiration that is used by photosynthetic producers. The light reactions produce _____. glucose and oxygen, completing the process of photosynthesis.
