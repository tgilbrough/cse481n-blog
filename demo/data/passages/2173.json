So it depends on how fast you walk. The Venetian is five minutes from Wynn/Encore. At least fifteen to MGM Grand. And probably ten minues to Bellagio and Paris, both on same corner.

To Wyne/Encore is about 10-15 minutes 3. To Bellagio is about 10 minutes 4. To Paris is about 15 minutes The hotels are farther apart than they appear on a map. The properties are all quite large, so hotels that are side-by-side can actually be pretty far apart."}]
