There are two of these bony swellings, sometimes called the sitting bones, located at the front of the superior ramus of the ischium, which is the lower back portion of the hip bone. Due to the number of leg muscles attached to the ischial tuberosity, sports-related injuries are fairly common in this area. Sports such as running, soccer, and cycling, where a high level of strain is put on the thighs, are often the culprit."}, {"url": "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tuberosity", "passage_text": "Medical Definition of TUBEROSITY. : a rounded prominence; especially: a large prominence on a bone usually serving for the attachment of muscles or ligaments.

The greater tuberosity, located on the humerus next to the head of the humerus and the lesser tuberosity, is a large, bulbous protrusion from this long arm bone that serves as an attachment point for several muscles. Four of these muscles control movement of the shoulder. "}, {"url": "http://www.shoulderdoc.co.uk/article/1482", "passage_text": "The greater tuberosity is the prominent area of bone at the top of the humerus and is the attachment for the two large, powerful rotator cuff muscles-supraspinatus and infraspinatus. It is injured/fractured in a fall by either landing directly onto the side of your shoulder or landing with your arm outstretched. As greater tuberosity fractures are usually retracted posteriorly and superiorly, a closed reduction is difficult. If left in position, impingement will develop against the acromion, limiting elevation and external rotation of the shoulder."}]
