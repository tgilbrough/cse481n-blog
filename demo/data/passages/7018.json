A function that can be graphically represented in the Cartesian coordinate plane by a straight line is called a Linear Function. A linear function is a first degree polynomial of the form, F(x) = m x + c, where m and c are constants and x is a real variable. The constant m is called slope and c is called y-intercept. 1 Step 1: The graph of a linear function is a straight line. 2  Step 2: Graph 4 is a straight line. 3  Step 3: So, Graph 4 represents a linear function."}, {"url": "http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/linear-programming.html", "passage_text": "7 people found this helpful.
