If the DRE is normal but the PSA is moderately elevated, a free PSA test may be used to look at the ratio of free to total PSA.

The prostate gland produces PSA, a protein that at an elevated level may be a sign of prostate cancer. PSA levels are measured in nanograms of PSA per milliliter of blood, or ng/mL. Men with a high PSA level are more likely to have prostate cancer than men with low levels, though there are no normal and abnormal ranges of PSA in the blood.

An antigen is an antibody designed to protect against disease. And because we can test for a prostate specific antigen, the volume of that antigen can indicate the seriousness of any disease that is attacking the prostate. By itself, a PSA reading does not mean very much. The PSA is only a very rough indicator. It certainly does not predict prostate cancer, but it may give you an early indication. However, the PSA is very unreliable and essentially flawed as a test for prostate cancer because a raised PSA can mean many different things"}]
