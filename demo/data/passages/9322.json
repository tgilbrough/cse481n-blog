Square gate all around MOSFET is a promising device structure at present era of continued scaling due to their superior control over the short channel effects. However, it exhibits a undesirable effect known as corner effect which degrades the device performance by increasing the off state leakage current. In this work a new technique to suppress the corner effect has been proposed, modelled, simulated and its results have been compared with existing structure of square gate all around MOSFET.
