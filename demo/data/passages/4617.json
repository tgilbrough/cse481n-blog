The three amino acids we test in our decarboxylase media are arginine, lysine, and ornithine. The decarboxylase test is useful for differentiating the Enterobacteriaceae. Decarboxylase broth contains nutrients, dextrose (a fermentable carbohydrate), pyridoxal (an enzyme cofactor for decarboxylase), and the pH indicators bromcresol purple and cresol red.

This reaction is the committed step in polyamine synthesis. In humans, this protein has 461 amino acids and forms a homodimer. The ornithine decarboxylation reaction catalyzed by ornithine decarboxylase is the first and committed step in the synthesis of polyamines, particularly putrescine, spermidine and spermine. Polyamines are important for stabilizing DNA structure, the DNA double strand-break repair pathway and as antioxidants"}, {"url": "http://www.vumicro.com/vumie/help/VUMICRO/Ornithine_decarboxylase_Test.htm", "passage_text": "The purpose is to see if the microbe can use the amino acid ornithine as a source of carbon and energy for growth. Use of ornithine is accomplished by the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. An inoculum from a pure culture is transferred aseptically to a sterile tube of ornithine decarboxylase broth.

Ornithine is an amino acid that some bacteria can use because of an enzyme called ornithine decarboxylase. Ornithine decarboxylase broth is thus used to determine whether the microbe can use the amino acid ornithine for carbon and energy. This is indicated by a change from purple to yellow during the first 24 hours of incubation. Once the medium has been acidified, the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase is activated. The culture is incubated an additional 24 hours at 35-37 C to allow the microbe to now use the ornithine."}, {"url": "http://www.vumicro.com/vumie/help/VUMICRO/Ornithine_decarboxylase_Test.htm", "passage_text": "Once the medium has been acidified, the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase is activated.
