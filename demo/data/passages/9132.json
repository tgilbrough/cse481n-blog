The most common thyroid problems involve abnormal production of thyroid hormones. Too much thyroid hormone results in a condition known as hyperthyroidism. Causes of hypothyroidism include: 1  Hashimoto's thyroiditis: In this autoimmune disorder, the body attacks thyroid tissue. 2  The tissue eventually dies and stops producing hormones. 3  Removal of the thyroid gland: The thyroid may have been surgically removed or chemically destroyed."}, {"url": "http://www.emedicinehealth.com/thyroid_problems/article_em.htm", "passage_text": "Diseases of the thyroid gland can result in either production of too much (overactive thyroid disease or hyperthyroidism), too little (underactive thyroid disease or hypothyroidism) thyroid hormone, thyroid nodules, and/or goiter.

Thyroid disease is a common problem that can cause symptoms because of over-or under-function of the thyroid gland.

Thyroid disease can also sometimes lead to enlargement of the thyroid gland in the neck, which can cause symptoms that are directly related to the increase in size of the organ (such as difficulty swallowing and discomfort in front of the neck)."}, {"url": "http://www.healthline.com/health/common-thyroid-disorders", "passage_text": "Thyroid nodules are growths that form on or in the thyroid gland. The causes are not always known but can include iodine deficiency and Hashimoto's disease. The nodules can be solid or fluid-filled.

The thyroid gland is located at the front of your neck. This gland secretes hormones that govern many of the functions in your body, such as the way the body uses energy, consumes oxygen and produces heat. Thyroid disorders typically occur when this gland releases too many or too few hormones. Hypothyroidism is often caused by Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks the thyroid gland. This condition can be treated using a drug called T4.
