The short answer is that 500 sheets of bond paper with a size of 17 by 22 have a weight of 20 pounds. The manufacturer would cut a sheet that big into four letter-size sheets, so a 500-sheet ream of 20-pound bond paper weighs 5 pounds. If it was something other than bond paper, then the size of the standard sheet used to determine the weight might be different.
