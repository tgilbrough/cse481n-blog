Polygons can be classified as either convex or concave. A polygon is convex if no line that contains a side of the polygon contains a point in the interior of the polygon. In a convex polygon, each interior angle measures less than 180 degrees."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Does_a_polygon_have_more_sides_or_more_angles", "passage_text": "Answer by Csanders0.
