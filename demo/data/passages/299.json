First trimester: less than 2.5 with a range of 0.1-2.5. Second trimester: 0.2-3.0. Third trimester: 0.3-3.0.

The function of thyroid stimulating hormone (or TSH) is to regulate the normal levels of thyroid hormones in the body. It is a peptide hormone secreted by the thyrotrope cells of anterior pituitary gland. The TSH activates the thyroid gland to produce both Triiodothyronine(T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones. Normal Levels in children. 1  The range of normal TSH levels for full term newborns is higher, as it can range from between 1.3 and 16 micro units per ML of blood. 2  The TSH range gradually reduces to 0.9 to 7.7 micro units per milliliter after 30 days."}, {"url": "http://www.thyroid.org/patient-thyroid-information/ct-for-patients/vol-3-issue-8/vol-3-issue-8-p-5-6/", "passage_text": "First Trimester TSH levels between 2.5 and 5.0 are associated with increased pregnancy loss.
