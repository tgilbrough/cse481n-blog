There is no one-size-fits-all rule for feeding your baby -- but he'll let you know when he's ready. Adding pureed foods to your baby\u2019s diet at around 4 months of age introduces a new world of tastes and textures. But knowing when to stop pureed foods -- usually around 1 year of age -- is important for helping your baby develop chewing and swallowing skills."}, {"url": "http://www.babycenter.com/0_age-by-age-guide-to-feeding-your-baby_1400680.bc", "passage_text": "If you want to give your baby a taste of tofu at age 6 months, go ahead, even though it's not listed on our chart until age 8 months.

You can start when you baby shows signs that formula/breastmilk is not enough anymore. normally around 4/5 months, but every child is different. Start by giving rice cereal with their milk at the night feed and then when everything goes well, start little bit (1-2 teaspoons is fine) of pureed fruit or veg. One at a time for about 3-4 days so you can see any allergic reactions if any. Dont rush, your baby. He/she will let you know when she needs more."}, {"url": "http://www.livestrong.com/article/527184-when-should-babies-eat-meat/", "passage_text": "Babies often are ready for solid foods at 4 to 6 months.
