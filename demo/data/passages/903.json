Several studies have concluded that the ventilatory threshold is highly correlated with endurance performance, in distances ranging from 26 miles (41.6 km) [r = -0.94] to 5 and 10 km (r = -0.945). The lactate threshold, in particular the individual anaerobic threshold, has been examined from a performance standpoint. Despite the apparent causal relationship between the stimulation of the ventilatory chemoreceptors and ultimately the ventilatory response and the accumulation of protons in the circulating blood, evidence does exist which refutes such a connection."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_ventilatory_threshold", "passage_text": "The ventilatory threshold is the point of exercise where your breathing starts to increase and become labored. It is when you cannot seem to pull in enough air. They both are reached are approx the same time, it is thought to be that the large change (drop) in blood pH when the lactate threshold is reached is causes ventilation to inc \u2026 rease rapidly to try and counteract this blood pH change."}, {"url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8446822", "passage_text": "The anaerobic threshold is commonly measured by either blood lactate (lactate threshold) or ventilatory gases (ventilatory threshold); however, the relationship between these 2 methods is not conclusive.
