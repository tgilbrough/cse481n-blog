I definitely believe that everyone can come to a consensus on what feels appropriate for a room temperature. I just think it truly depends on the time of day it is, and what kind of weather it is outside. At night, most people are inclined to enjoy a cooler setting as opposed to a warmer one. A normal temperature for that would be around 67-69 degrees. And for the daytime 69-72. If it is winter then your preferences may change because the overall temperature of your house goes down. It's all subjective, but I've found that most people find comfort in the 68-70 range overall. I know that advice has been given about having a home too warm or too cold but am not sure what a healthy temperature is. I like a very warm house in winter but don't like the attached bills! We keep our programmable thermostat at 68 degrees F. We have kids but we're all healthy with no special needs."}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_temperature", "passage_text": "It represents the small range of temperatures at which the air feels neither hot nor cold, approximately 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F).

RE: What should be the normal temperature for inside of a house in Pittsburgh, PA, with it being 25 outdoors? its winter time, and my husband likes to keep it at 64 degrees. I am always so cold and would like it at 72. Its usually in the 20&#39;s this time of year, and we fight over what the temp should be indoors. Either of those temperatures is normal. Ultimately, homeowners should keep their home at the temperature that is most comfortable for them at different times of year.
