They serve several different roles in the body, including fueling it, storing energy for the future, sending signals through the body and being a constituent of cell membranes, which hold cells together.

A lipid is a non-soluble molecular organic compound comprised of hydrogen and carbon. As far as their purpose in the human body goes, lipids are of crucial importance for both energy storage and cell membrane development. Plants and animals alike contain lipids which they depend on for energy. Gram for gram, a lipid contains more than twice the amount of energy found in carbohydrates. Lipoproteins. A lipoprotein is a combination of proteins and lipids found in a cell\u2019s membrane \u2013 examples being antigens and enzymes. Lipoprotein help fat move around the body in the bloodstream and exist in the form of Low Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and High Density Lipoprotein (LDL)."}, {"url": "http://biology.tutorvista.com/biomolecules/lipids.html", "passage_text": "Lipids. Lipids are important constituent of of the diet because they are a source of high energy value. Lipids are also important because of the fat-soluble vitamins, and essential fatty acids found in the fat of the natural food stuffs. Body fat serves as a very good source of energy, it is stored in adipose tissues. Fats and Oils (triglycerides and triacylglycerols) - These are esters of fatty acids with a trihydroxy alcohol, glycerol. A fat is solid at ordinary room temperature, an oil is liquid.
