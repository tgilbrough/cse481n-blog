[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle", "passage_text": "Skeletal muscle is a form of striated muscle tissue which is under the voluntary control of the somatic nervous system. It is one of three major muscle types, the others being cardiac muscle and smooth muscle. Most skeletal muscles are attached to bones by bundles of collagen fibers known as tendons. The myofibrils are composed of actin and myosin filaments, repeated in units called sarcomeres, the basic functional units of the muscle fiber. The sarcomere is responsible for the striated appearance of skeletal muscle, and forms the basic machinery necessary for muscle contraction."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/Why_are_skeletal_muscle_striated", "passage_text": "Lines/banding in the muscles-only in cardiac and skeletal muscles striated muscle is referring to skeletal and cardiac muscle.

Differentiation of these two types involves other structural features. We will examine these now! Skeletal muscle is the most abundant muscle type in the body.

Specifically, striated muscles are: 1  Pharyngeal muscle (embryologically different from skeletal muscle). 2  Cardiac muscle (heart muscle). 3  Skeletal muscle. Contractions in striated muscles are voluntary, except for the heart muscle, in which contractions are involuntary. Cardiac muscle is often treated separately from the other striated muscles, as it has somewhat different characteristics. A sarcomere is the functional unit of striated muscles."}, {"url": "http://www.answers.com/Q/What_makes_muscle_cells_look_striated", "passage_text": "Lines/banding in the muscles-only in cardiac and skeletal muscles striated muscle is referring to skeletal and cardiac muscle.

They are formed from the fusion of developmental myoblasts (a type of embryonic progenitor cell that gives rise to a muscle cell) in a process known as myogenesis.

These stripes are caused by the regular arrangement of actin and myosin proteins within the cells into structures known as myofibrils. Within muscle tissue are three distinct groups of tissues: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Each of these tissue groups is made of specialized cells that give the tissue its unique properties."}, {"url": "http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/histology_mh/strimusc.html", "passage_text": "In contrast to smooth muscle, cardiac and skeletal muscle types possess an internal ultrastructure of highly organized contractile myofilaments.
