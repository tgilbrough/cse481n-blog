The price of a pub pint of beer could soon go up to \u00a34 and \u2018has doubled in the last 19 years\u2019 said The Guardian a while back, in an article warning about the soaring price of barley. There are inflation calculators on the Internet. Type in the amount and the year: the site does the sums and tells you the equivalent in today\u2019s money. The results can be instructive. That 1991 pint cost around \u00a31.40, which is \u00a31.80 in today\u2019s money. The current price is around \u00a32.80, so beer really is more expensive. On the other hand, the average salary in 1991 was \u00a319,000, and today it is \u00a338,000. Relative to what we earn, a pint costs exactly the same as it did 19 years ago"}, {"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080719205857AAYFP5Z", "passage_text": "Wa\u0142brzych ...
